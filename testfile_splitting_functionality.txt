Good morning, ladies and gentleman, and welcome to the Neuronetics Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Klausner from Westwicke Partners. Sir, you may begin

Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Neuronetics' Third Quarter 2018 Conference Call. A replay of this call will be available on our website for 30 days. Joining me on today's call are Neuronetics' Chief Executive Officer, Chris Thatcher; and its Chief Financial Officer, Peter Donato

Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements governed by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements relating to our business strategy, financial and revenue guidance and other operational items and metrics. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business

For a discussion of risks and uncertainties associated with Neuronetics' business, I encourage you to review the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's final prospectus relating to its initial public offering, and the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q that will be filed today

The company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the course of this call, except as required by law

During the call, we will also present certain financial information on a non-GAAP basis, including EBITDA. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures taken in conjunction with U.S. GAAP financial measures provide useful information for both management and investors by excluding certain noncash and other expenses that are not indicative of our core operating results

Management uses non-GAAP measures to compare our performance relative to forecasts and strategic plans to benchmark our performance externally against competitors, and for certain compensation decisions

Reconciliations between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results are presented in tables accompanying our earnings release. Reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the approximate GAAP measures is provided in the company's press release for the quarter, which can be viewed on our website

With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Neuronetics' Chief Executive Officer, Chris Thatcher

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'll start by providing an update on our performance during the third quarter followed by an update on the progress we've made towards our key priorities. I will then hand the call over to Peter, who will walk through our financial performance and guidance, after which, we will open the line up to take your questions

The third quarter was very strong, with worldwide revenue growing by 31% over the prior year, and U.S. revenue growing by 30%

Our performance continues to validate the commercial strategy that we have developed and put into place, our ability to execute in a competitive market, and most importantly, the promise of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy's clinical outcomes for patients, which offers a viable alternative for psychiatrists serving their patients with treatment-resistant depression

As we've mentioned on our first call as a public company in August, we have 3 strategic priorities, as we seek to drive growth in our business. As a reminder, the first one is to continue to drive the adoption of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in the U.S. through the expansion of our sales force and the implementation of marketing initiatives

Second, increasing reoccurring treatment session revenue by improving active system utilization by penetrating high-volume single and group practices. And third, make progress towards obtaining reimbursement approval and expanding commercialization in Japan

I would now like to provide an update on the progress we've made on each of these priorities. During the third quarter, we continued to expand our sales force. Our goal for 2018 was to add an incremental 15 BDM territories adding to the 29 BDM territories we had at the start of the year. As a reminder, BDM or Business Development Managers are focused on capital sales

During the first half of the year, we filled 10 of those 15 BDM territories, all of which were active by the end of the second quarter

In the third quarter, we filled 4 of the remaining 5 territories, slightly ahead of plan. And I'm pleased to report that each of those 4 territories are fully trained and active

The plan is to fill the final position in Q4, and with a total of 44 BDM territories at the end of the fourth quarter and going into 2019, we believe we can continue to grow growth in the active installed base into the future. We anticipate the continued expansion of our BDM territories in 2019

We're very excited with the quality of the salespeople we've been able to attract, and we believe it speaks to the significant market opportunity for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy

We have developed a proven sales strategy as demonstrated by consistent growth, both as a private and a public company. However, I felt we could and can do better. To help drive our ongoing commercial execution, we created a Chief Commercial Officer role in the second quarter to manage our larger and expanding sales and marketing teams, and manage the day-to-day commercial operations. This role oversees approximately 130 people across a variety of functions, including sales, marketing, reimbursement and customer support

Shifting gears to our marketing initiatives. As we mentioned on our last call, during the second quarter, we launched a national TV advertising campaign aimed at raising patient awareness that NeuroStar Advanced Therapy can treat major depressive disorder, should anti-depression medications not work for them. All of our website metrics were up significantly, immediately following the launch of the TV ads, and we believe that at least some of the uptick in treatment session revenue during the middle part of the year was due to the TV ads

In addition to driving sales, another goal of these ads were to further develop the NeuroStar brand and increase the awareness of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy among major depressive disorder patients, their families and friends, as well as psychiatrists and physicians

Based on the success of the initial TV ads, we have decided to launch another round of TV ads during the [first] quarter, in order to continue to increase treatment session revenue and brand awareness

As some of you may know, October was Depression Awareness Month. In conjunction with our ongoing marketing efforts, we launched additional PR, online interviews and televised satellite tour designed to increase national awareness and to educate the public on NeuroStar Advanced Therapy as an innovative depression treatment option, while sparking a much-needed dialogue on breaking the stigma associated with mental health. The satellite tour was picked up by tens of TV stations across the country

During October, the company hit a milestone as the 2 millionth NeuroStar Advanced Therapy treatment session was delivered. It is incredibly rewarding to be part of a company that has transformed so many lives and continues to do so every day

We remain focused on providing hope to those who need it most, and make sure as many people as possible know about this proven treatment, not just during national Depression Awareness Month, but throughout the year

Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, the company attended the 31st Annual U.S. Psychiatric and Mental Health Congress, more commonly known as the Psych Congress held in Orlando

While at the Congress, we hosted a context-sensing challenge, which allowed attendees to witness how easy it can be for a TMS System to lose contact with a patient during a treatment session, especially when the system lacks the ability to monitor a patient's positioning

The smallest movement by the patient during treatment can result in a dramatic loss in the prescribed treatment dose. Even a 1-millimeter movement of the head away from the coil can result in a 40% loss of the prescribed treatment dose. Our patented continuous contact sensing solves this problem. NeuroStar is the only TMS System in the market that provides contact sensing technology, to deliver the right dose to the right location every time to treat depression and maximize a patient's chance of achieving remission

We believe that this allows for precise and reproducible treatments for each and every patient. This is just one example of how we have developed our market-leading position

Turning to our initiatives to drive reoccurring treatment session revenue. On our last call, we discussed our strategy to introduce and integrate the CTC or the Clinical Training Consultant

During the second quarter, we hit our 2018 target of hiring and training 9 CTCs. The CTC position was created to allow the CPC or the Clinical Practice Consultant to focus on driving pull-through rather than spending time training and onboarding new practices

While we are seeing accelerating revenues or volume increases for treatment sessions, it's too early to disaggregate and attribute that increase directly to this initiative. However, there has clearly been a positive improvement to utilization. So we're encouraged that the combination of all of our strategies, the BDM expansion, the CTC integration, high-volume, target account focus and market efforts -- marketing efforts are driving growth in the business, and have set the stage to continue our success in the fourth quarter and into 2019

As Peter will discuss in more detail, we have seen a significant uptick in treatment session volume year-over-year. This is being driven both by the increase in the active installed base, and an increase in the utilization per system. Much of this increase is due to the execution of our HVT strategy, as we see these practices performing at higher volumes. This speaks to the market demand for our therapy and the ability of motivated providers to attract patients

As it relates to our product pipeline, we had a successful launch of our next-generation TrakStar practice management system during the second quarter. Early feedback has been very positive, as practitioners have commented on the fact that they really like the cloud-based data management system, because they are able to better monitor system usage real-time across their existing offices along with employee usage of the system in order to increase efficiency across their network

Lastly, we continue to make good progress towards achieving reimbursement in Japan by the end of 2018. During the second quarter, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare or MHLW accepted our submission for reimbursement. Since that time we have had very positive interactions with MHLW. We currently expect that our reimbursement code will be decided in the December of 2018, and published in March of 2019, at which point, we can commence commercial efforts

In advance of the anticipated decision on reimbursement, our partner in Japan, Teijin Pharmaceuticals has been working diligently on market development efforts to be prepared to launch

In order to do so, they have focused on sales rep training, physician training, and the establishment of key reference sites. Teijin has made a significant investment in sales force education in order to have 100% of their reps fully trained on selling NeuroStar Advanced Therapy

They've also been very proactive in getting physicians trained, both on the science of TMS in general as well as the benefits of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy

Year-to-date, 150 providers have gone through the general science training on TMS and about half have now completed NeuroStar Advanced Therapy training, and the remainder are on track to be completed by year-end. These trainings have been very well attended, and there continues to be high demand for future events with an upcoming January 2019 TMS training session already fully booked with 150 physicians

Teijin's free commercialization activities are well on their way. They're establishing key sites throughout Japan to allow as many prospective accounts as possible to interact with the NeuroStar system and speak with KOLs on the treatment. We will continue to provide updates on our progress in Japan, as key milestones are achieved

I would now like to turn the call over to Peter for a financial review. Peter?

Thanks, Chris. Total revenue for the quarter was $13.7 million, a 31% increase over the prior year quarter. U.S. revenue was $13.5 million, an increase of 30% over the third quarter of 2017

OUS revenue was approximately $220,000, an increase of 135% versus the prior year period. The increase in OUS revenue was primarily a function of milestone payments as well as a small number of treatment session sales to our Japanese distributor. You should be aware that the milestone payments in Japan of $2.75 million collected to date are being amortized over the life of the contract

U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenue was $3.9 million during the third quarter, a 38% increase over the prior year

As a reminder, NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenue primarily consists of revenue from capital sales, but also includes revenue from coils, rentals and upgrades. Capital revenue grew 58% driven by higher volume during the period as a result of our ongoing sales force expansion and marketing initiatives

In addition, we saw a 1% increase in average selling price as compared to the prior year period. These positive trends were partially offset by lower upgrade, rentals and other related revenue in the quarter

During the quarter, we saw our active installed-base increase to 858 units, a net increase of 42 units from June 30, 2018, and an increase of 133 units from September 30, 2017

Keep in mind, we define an active unit as a NeuroStar unit that was either purchased or rented during the quarter or one which has ordered NeuroStar treatment sessions during the last 12 months

U.S. Treatment session revenue was $9.2 million for the third quarter of 2018, an increase of 28% over the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to an approximate 31% increase in treatment sessions purchased, plus a 3% increase in other treatment session revenue. This was partially offset by an approximate 6% decline in treatment session ASPs

This pricing decline was slightly higher than our expectations due to the success of our HVT strategy, which has resulted in higher realization of volume pricing discounts that we provide to customers, who perform a significant number of procedures as Chris talked about earlier

U.S. service and other revenue was approximately $400,000, a 15% increase as a result of our expanded active installed base

Gross profit for the third quarter of 2018 was $10.7 million, an increase of $2.8 million from $7.9 million during the third quarter of 2017. Gross margin for the third quarter of 2018 was 77.9%, which was higher than the third quarter of 2017 gross margin of 74.9%

The improvement in gross margin was driven by increased leverage on our field service and operations cost as a result of higher year-over-year total revenues, which were slightly offset by lower international NeuroStar sales. While we are starting to see operating leverage and expect to see a benefit from that in the future, we do not expect to see such a significant year-over-year uptick going forward. As a reminder, we continue to drive gross margins toward the mid-70% range for 2018

Sales and marketing expenses for the third quarter of 2018 were $9.7 million, an increase of $3.1 million over the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to costs associated with the expansion of our sales force, as well as additional marketing efforts

General administrative expenses were $3.2 million, an increase of about $1 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher expenses as a result of being a public company

Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2018 were $2.1 million, an increase of approximately $300,000 from the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to continued investment in advanced development projects, partially offset by lower spending on clinical studies

Net loss for the third quarter was $5 million, compared to a net loss of $3.8 million in the third quarter of 2017

EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure for the third quarter of 2018 was a loss of $3.8 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $2.8 million in the third quarter of 2017, for all the reasons cited previously

Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $106.8 million compared to $14.5 million at June 30, 2018 and $29.1 million at year-end 2017. Cash usage during the quarter was in line with our expectations

As a reminder, on July 2, 2018, we closed our IPO in which we issued and sold 6.325 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $17 per share. We received net proceeds of $96.5 million after deducting all operating expenses, which given the timing of our offering was not reflected in our GAAP reported cash number at the end of Q2

Turning to guidance. For the full year 2018, we now expect total worldwide revenue of between $51 million and $52.5 million, representing growth in the range of 26% to 30% over the prior year. This is an increase over our previous guidance range of $50 million to $51.5 million

I will now hand the call back over to Chris

Thank you, Peter. We had very strong third quarter. We were able to grow revenue by 31%, as we continue to sell more NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems, while at the same time driving greater pull-through within these placements

This exceptional growth has come as a result of focused efforts on the long-term commercial strategy that we put in place, in combination with the development of our industry-leading TMS technology for the treatment of drug resistant-depression. We're very excited about the future at Neuronetics. Looking at the remainder of 2018 and 2019, we will continue to work diligently to bring NeuroStar Advanced Therapy to an even greater number of psychiatrists and their patients. With that, I'd like to open the line for questions

================================================================================
Questions and Answers

(Operator Instructions)
 Our first question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray

Either Chris or Peter, just in looking at the guidance for the year, obviously, really good performance during Q3. Guidance coming up a little bit for Q4 here -- for the full year, sorry, Q4 not changing much, an easier comp that you just saw here in Q3 -- here in Q4

So just wanted to make sure there is not anything that we're missing from a system placement perspective? A bigger bulk purchase in Q3? Or anything along those lines that you're trying to signal here in Q4 that may weigh a little bit on the top line, even though it's still really good expected top line growth?

Yes, thanks, Matt. This is Peter. I'll let Chris answer with some color commentary, so just to put closure to first part of your question, there is nothing unusual or any bulks or nuances that would influence that guidance one way or the other. So I'll let Chris add some more commentary around Q4

Yes. Matt, thanks for asking that question. If you look at Q4, Q4 is one of our lowest quarterly growth rates year-over-year for treatment sessions. Typically, what happens in Q4 is NeuroStar System sales are at the highest of the year. And we're expecting terrific NeuroStar System sales in Q4

Although we increased our CTCs, the increase in Q4 system sales provides a headwind to a pull-through efforts due to the higher number of installs and trainings required. They're out there. We're going to have to -- with the number systems expected in Q4, this will outstrip the CTC team and the CTC team will be involved in installs. This happened again last year as well

So there is a -- and there's also a couple of points of growth here. In Q4, 2017, we benefited from the launch of the upgraded coil, and that's not going to occur this year. But that's a couple of points of growth there as well

Okay. Very fair. And then -- and obviously, the capital number was extremely strong this quarter. Can you just deconstruct a little bit the performance among some of your more established reps versus some of the newer ones?
 Because as I look at the numbers, versus what you did last year, there is -- I think there is an opportunity for the entire group to go up pretty meaningfully from a productivity per quarter perspective not -- they're not trending very well right now. But is that a fair assessment? Or just again, can you just kind of deconstruct the older reps versus the ones that you recently brought on board?

Yes, yes. So good question. So our model, the way we think about it is, as we add reps and as they mature, they become more productive. And that typically occurs somewhere between 12 and 18 months they hit their stride and their performance is higher

And so when you look at our hiring, we did a fair bit of hiring in the fourth quarter of last year, and then we paced it early part of this year. On a weighted average Matt, we actually have slightly less experienced reps in Q4 of this year than we actually did in Q4 of last year

So -- and then there is generally not a cliffing or a binary event that takes place, it's gradual over time. So the productivity on a quarter-over-quarter basis is actually lower. But our full-time equivalents are up almost 80-plus percent versus this time last year

Got it. And last one for me. And I know it's really early, but I'm just a little bit curious about the impact of the CTCs on the CPCs? Anything you can provide just a little bit of color, again, I get it's early as far as the impact that those folks are having on your treatment session business

Yes. So it's difficult, Matt. I mean, the way to solve for that empirically is that we don't do any other activities in the field like BDM expansion, the marketing and soft target and high-value targets, just to track kind of what happens with those CTCs, that's a difficult exercise and not in the best interest of the business

I think more intuitively, this time last year the CPCs were doing all the training. This year, we have 11 full-time bodies doing all of the training. And as I mentioned in the last call, that gave us really good leverage in Q1, Q2 and Q3. But that leverage starts to wane over the quarters. And as we move into Q4, there is a big step-up here in system sales

We have this 44-man army -- men and women army out there, who are really maturing, and we're expecting big things from them in Q4. So I think they'll outstrip that leverage fortunately, unfortunately in Q4. And then, we'll look to add more CTCs and CPCs here in the future

Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair

So first off, I was hoping to focus a little bit more on the utilization for active system, which for us by our math might even approach double-digit growth, which is quite strong. So first, can you comment whether it reached double-digit growth?
 And then second, maybe walk us through what could drive that as we go forward into Q4 and into 2019, especially, since it sounds like you're going to do a little bit more DTC study in Q4?

Right. So we're really excited about the total NeuroStar treatment session revenue growth. I mean this was a big step up and we've managed to improve quarter-over-quarter on that

And then the other thing is, is we're selling a lot more systems, right? So -- and those systems -- when we sell those systems, they don't really attribute to utilization very much in their first couple quarters

So when you think about our NeuroStar treatment session utilization growing just north of 8% year-over-year with a 20% increase in the number of systems over prior year, I mean, that typically is dilutive to system utilization. The fact that we can post high single-digit growth on a per unit basis, we're pretty proud of that right now

Okay. So maybe just to key-in further kind of on various reasons for that and kind of the spending on the DTC. So if you go on Google trends and you start to see all the hits coming up on NeuroStar, or on iSpot.tv you can see the amount of ads that are going out on you guys whether it's you or whether it's some of the local ads that are going around out there to your depression tour

But can you walk us through kind of the revenue return per dollars spent? How quickly we should see a return on that spending? And then whether or not you guys can target your ads better now that you have a little bit more experience with it as well?

Yes -- no, thanks, Margaret. Yes, so we qualified the first DTC campaign as a beta. And we learned a fair bit. We learned a couple things as it relates to the channels in which we were going to extend through meaning actually the TV channels. And so we've actually modified this campaign based on those learnings. We're actually going to fewer shows that are more closely targeted actually to depression audience. We can get some research. We have some research now, where people with depression tend to watch

The second thing is, is operationally what we're doing this time is we found out that if a provider doesn't call back through our website they can request an appointment or schedule an appointment or click a call. And if they don't call back that patient immediately they lose that patient. So we've actually worked with our providers leading into this round of DTC to tighten up that feedback loop

So those are the things that we're doing differently. I would call this a beta-plus program, and we're still experimenting. We are -- we do know that we are breaking all of our records already right now in web sessions, physician-locator searches, and booking appointments at this stage of the campaign versus last year

And the challenge there is then being able to track those patients, getting to the practice, and then once they get to the practice, turning them into treatment sessions. So we're tightening that feedback loop on this next round. And we'll be able to understand going forward a little better what that return on investment is

But I think, we've qualified and quantified this before, this is not millions of dollars of spends, we're learning as it relates to what the return on investment is here. But clearly, it did help us, I mean, the types of numbers that we're seeing here in the third quarter and in the back half of the second quarter are up, and this is just one reason why

If you guys go to the next stage it sounds like you did get utilization growth right up. And then just kind of last question on Japan. I think you guys have a number of NeuroStar systems already in Japan. And I think you referenced 150 physicians that are showing up to some of the training sessions

So are those folks that already have a system? And then once you do get reimbursement, should we assume a pretty quick ramp given the installed-base that is already out there?

Oh, yes, thanks. So really there are no active commercial units in Japan currently. And the only thing that's in our revenue line right now is an amortized milestone payment for the upfront milestone that we got from Teijin, when we signed the contract

So what you're seeing -- so what's going on is the JSPN called -- has an annual meeting, 2 meetings a year where they train on the basic science of TMS. And in June, they held their meeting and in 72 hours of notice of the meeting, the meeting was full. And they announced a couple weeks ago that they're doing a course again in January, and within 2 days the meeting was full. So these are people that don't have systems, that are really interested in learning more about the science

And then what happens is our partner, Teijin, then takes about 20 of those providers every month and brings them to their facility and goes through the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System in detail with them, so they're familiar with the technology

And then what they are also working on right now is capital equipment budgets in 2019. So they're setting the stage with these providers roughly somewhere between 200 and 300 before capital equipment budgets are due, they'll have talked to and discussed the opportunity to put a NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System into their facility

And our next question comes from Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity

Congratulations on a good quarter. I was going to start somewhere else Chris, but the Japan discussion, I wanted to pull on that thread little bit more, it sounds interesting. So can you frame the Japanese opportunity for us again, relative to the U.S. opportunity? Just as you look at the geographical makeup of Japan, the patient makeup of Japan relative to the U.S., just as using the U.S. as a guide?
 And just sort of give us some sort of a qualitative assessment of how Japan may play out next year? Because I don't think many of us have much in the way of revenue and the stock probably doesn't trade on Japan next year, but if you're doing well in the U.S., and you get a kicker in Japan, it certainly will make a difference. So maybe you level set us with Japan and how that rolls out in the first year?

Sure, Jason. Yes, thanks for the question. Right. So when we think about the market opportunity, we think about the market opportunity in the serviceable addressable market to be about 1/3 of what it is in the U.S. The serviceable addressable market in the U.S. is about $3 billion. The serviceable addressable market in Japan is about $1 billion

The difference in Japan is, they actually have a much higher concentration of psychiatric-only hospitals, local community-based hospitals. And a lot of their moderate to severe MDD patients are actually admitted to inpatient facilities. And they're not treated on an outpatient basis

So it's a little bit slightly different model. That's why we picked our partner Teijin Pharma, because they have really good relationships within the inpatient hospitals throughout Japan, and these psychiatric hospitals throughout Japan. So that's why we picked that partner

We have not -- giving any guidance as it relates to revenues for Japan. We will provide that in the -- during our first quarter call next year. By that time, we'll better understand not just if we got reimbursement, what that reimbursement rate is, because that will certainly have some impact on the first year and the following year revenues

The other thing -- the only other thing I'd say is that the awareness in Japan is on TMS is actually much higher than where the company started when the company got their approval in 2009. And there is quite a bit good understanding of our success here in the States. And so I view that adoption curve to potentially be better sooner, faster, steeper in Japan early versus the adoption current that we had when we first rolled out the product here

And remember, the other thing is, is that we'll have national reimbursement. So everyone will be covered come March 1, if everything goes through this year. Everyone will be covered March 1. So we don't have to worry about converting the max in 95 other private payors. We won't have that barrier of entry in our way

Got it. That's helpful. And just a follow-up on this and then one for the U.S. Maybe give us a sense for the competitive landscape in Japan as you see it over the next couple of years? You're doing fine here and there's a few smaller competitors that we get questions on, but clearly, in the United States here, you're doing just fine. In Japan, what's that look like?

Yes. So Japan -- we know that one of our competitors applied several years ago for approval. And our understanding was that they didn't accept their clinical data. But that was many years ago. We understand that at least one of our competitors has applied for approval. And it remains to be seen what MHLW will require, as it relates to the clinical data

That said, we feel like we've got a head start for sure, I mean, we're going to be the only approved product in Japan to start. And then, others will have to get their product approved during MHLW process. So the competitive landscape will be a little bit less competitive than in this year in the U.S

Okay. And then just lastly for me in the United States, Chris, can you give us a sense for -- you placed more NeuroStar Systems than we were modeling this quarter, which is good. And I'm just curious the makeup of those new system placements, specifically, into which they are going?
 Maybe talk a little bit about the number of brand-new customers that you brought on board this quarter? How that's trending? Folks that are adding a second or a third system? And what that might mean to utilization? Just any context you can give with respect to the complexion of customers in the quarter?

Sure, Jason. So we've seen over the last couple quarters more multisystem initial purchases from first-time customers. And most of our purchases in any given quarter are from first-time customers. And so -- and then, we are seeing the number of systems per location increase slightly from where we were at the beginning of the year. So we are seeing some follow-on in our existing customer base, and we are seeing more multisystem purchases upfront

And I'm showing no further question at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Chris Thatcher for any further remarks

Thanks again, for joining us today. And we look forward to updating you on our progress on our next call

Ladies and gentleman, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Neuronetics Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded

I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Mark Klausner from Westwicke. Sir, you may begin

Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Neuronetics' Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Conference Call. A replay of this call will be available on our website for 30 days. Joining me on today's call are: Neuronetics' Chief Executive Officer, Chris Thatcher; and its Chief Financial Officer, Peter Donato

Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements covered under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements related to our business strategy, financial and revenue guidance and other operational items and metrics. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties associated with Neuronetics' business, I encourage you to review the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K that will be filed today. The company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the course of this call, except as required by law

During the call, we'll also discuss certain financial information on a non-GAAP basis, including EBITDA. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures, taken in conjunction with U.S. GAAP financial measures, provide useful information for both management and investors by excluding certain noncash and other expenses that are not indicative of our core operating results. Management uses non-GAAP measures to compare our performance relative to forecasts and strategic plans to benchmark our performance externally against competitors and for certain compensation decisions. Reconciliations between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results are presented in tables accompanying our press release, which can be viewed on our website

With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Neuronetics' Chief Executive Officer, Chris Thatcher

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'll start by providing an update on our performance during the fourth quarter and the full year 2018, followed by an update on the progress we made towards our key priorities. I'll then hand the call over to Peter to walk through our financial performance and guidance for Q1 and 2019, after which we will discuss our priorities for 2019 before opening up the line to take your questions

Overall, the fourth quarter was very strong as we continued to drive the adoption of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. Total revenue was $15.6 million, an increase of 29% over the prior year, largely driven by 37% growth in U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy revenue and 23% growth in U.S. treatment session revenue

For the full year of 2018, total revenue was $52.8 million, an increase of 31% over the prior year. We are proud of what we've been able to accomplish in 2018. Our performance demonstrates our ability to execute on our strategy to drive the adoption of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy and maintain our market leadership position. We've continued to see strong growth in a number of psychiatric practices utilizing our therapy, which, we believe, is driven by our ability to offer a clinically proven therapy that is both user- and patient-friendly, while at the same time providing world-class training, practice support and service

Shifting gears to an update on our operating performance. As we outlined last year, we have three strategic priorities as we seek to drive growth in the business: As a reminder, the first was to continue to drive the adoption of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in the U.S. through the expansion of our sales force and the implementation of marketing initiatives. Second, increase recurrent treatment session revenue by improving active system utilization by penetrating high-volume single group practice. And third, make progress towards obtaining reimbursement approval and commercialization in Japan

So taking each of these in order. During the fourth quarter, we continued to expand our sales force. Our goal for 2018 was to add an incremental 15 BDM territories on top of the 29 BDM territories which were active at the beginning of 2018. As a reminder, the BDMs are Business Development Managers who are focused on driving capital sales. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, we filled 14 of the 15 BDM territories, and we filled the last BDM territory in the fourth quarter, bringing our total to 44 at the end of the year. We're very pleased with how these recently hired reps have been able to get up to speed with their hiring and productivity being slightly ahead of our internal modeling

During the fourth quarter, we continued to utilize TV advertising campaigns to help increase patient awareness of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy and ultimately drive increased utilization. We ran our second national DTC campaign of the year in October and November. Leveraging the learnings from our initial campaign, we optimized our strategy to more effectively target potential patients. We saw strong lifts in many key return metrics, including website traffic and lead generation, which is characterized as position locator usage, click-to-call usage and appointments generated, which we're very pleased with. While we view this as a very successful campaign, we did learn that there is an opportunity to improve our customers' conversion rates or converting an interested patient into an active patient. What we learned is that in order to convert a patient, the psychiatric office must respond within a very narrow window of time, following the potential patient's initial outreach, after which, conversion metrics declined significantly. As we look into the future marketing campaigns, we will work with our customers to help take advantage of this opportunity

Part of our strategy to drive and improve system utilization was the addition of the CTC, or Clinical Training Consultant, in 2019. We hired 9 CTCs in the first half of 2018 to help more quickly onboard new accounts and allow for the CPC to focus on working with psychiatrists and practices to successfully treat patients and drive increased utilization. Given our recent BDM expansion, we felt the CTC addition will be critical in order to keep up with the new customer training. In the second half of the year, we were able to see an overall improvement and pull-through as systems were able to begin treating patients more quickly at a higher rate than in previous years. I'm very proud of the commercial organization that we have been able to build over the last few years and specifically, the progress we made in 2018. We've developed and grown a highly sophisticated, deeply integrated commercial infrastructure which encompasses sales, marketing, reimbursement and customer support. I look forward to leveraging what we built to continue to drive adoption for years to come

Moving to Japan. As we announced in January, we believe a decision on reimbursement will occur in the second half of 2019 and remain enthusiastic on the opportunity to bring our product to a country that would so greatly benefit. This shift in timeline came as a result of discussions we had with the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare during the fourth quarter. The shift was largely driven by routine trade-off decisions involving reimbursement rates and the breadth of provider access. In anticipation of the reimbursement decision, we have continued to work with our partner in Japan, Teijin Pharmaceuticals, on market development efforts ahead of an official launch. Teijin remains a committed partner. They've invested millions of dollars to establish and develop a fully dedicated division within the company focused on the eventual commercial launch in NeuroStar Advanced Therapy throughout Japan

I would now like to turn the call over to Peter to review our financial results

Thanks, Chris. Total revenue for the quarter was $15.6 million, a 29% increase over the prior year quarter. U.S. revenue was $15.1 million, an increase of 27% over the fourth quarter of 2017. OUS revenue was approximately $550,000, an increase of 101% versus the prior year period. The increase in OUS revenue was primarily a function of NeuroStar system sales in Japan as well as the ongoing amortization of milestone payments from our Japanese partner

U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue was $4.8 million during the fourth quarter, a 37% increase over the prior year. As a reminder, NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue primarily consists of revenue from capital sales, but also includes revenue from system upgrades to allow our NeuroStar systems to perform 19-minute treatment sessions. Capital sales revenue grew 46%, driven by higher unit sales volume during the period as a result of our ongoing sales force expansion and continued marketing initiatives. This was partially offset by a 4% decrease in average selling price as compared to the prior year period. The positive trends in capital sales volume and revenue were partially offset by lower upgrades for the 19-minute treatment session in 2018 versus 2017

During the quarter, we saw our active installed base increase to 907 units, a net increase of 49 units from the third quarter of 2018 and an increase of 155 units from year-end 2017. Keep in mind, we define an active unit as a NeuroStar unit that was placed in service during the quarter or one that ordered treatment sessions during the last 12 months

U.S. treatment sessions revenue's was $9.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to an approximate 26% increase in treatment sessions purchased as well as a 3% increase in other treatment session revenue. This was partially offset by just under a 6% decline in treatment session ASPs due to predetermined volume pricing discounts within our existing customer base, which are triggered when those customers surpass certain predefined high-volume thresholds. U.S. service and other revenue was approximately $400,000, a 21% increase as a result of our expanded installed base

Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $11.9 million, an increase of $2.8 million from $9.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 76.3%, which was higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 gross margin of 75.6%. The improvement in gross margin was driven by increased leverage on our service and operations areas

Sales and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2018 were $10.6 million, an increase of $2 million over the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the increased size of our sales force and the spending on our marketing campaigns. General and administrative expenses were $4.7 million, an increase of about $1.9 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased costs related to being a public company. Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2018 were $2.2 million, an increase of approximately $300,000 from the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel and product development costs related to the commencement of our next-generation platform design

Net loss for the fourth quarter was $6.1 million compared to a net loss of $4.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, for the fourth quarter of 2018 was a loss of $5 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017

Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $104.6 million compared to $106.8 million at the end of the third quarter of 2018 and $29.1 million at year-end 2017. Cash usage during the quarter was in line with our expectations

Turning to guidance. For the full year 2019, we expect total worldwide revenue of between $62.5 million and $64.5 million, representing approximately 18% and 22% year-over-year growth, respectively. For the full year 2019, we expect gross margins to be in the mid-70s range, in line with full year 2018 margins and previous guidance. For the full year of 2019, we expect operating expenses to be between $71.5 million and $76.5 million, primarily due to continued investment in our sales force expansion efforts, research and development related to the development of our next-generation NeuroStar platform and clinical spending as we pursue additional indications for use, namely PTSD and Bi-Polar disorders

For the first quarter of 2019, we expect total worldwide revenue of between $12.4 million and $13 million, representing 22% and 28% year-over-year growth, respectively

I'll now turn the call back over to Chris. Chris?

Thanks, Peter. As we look to 2019, our primary focus is driving the continued adoption of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy and bringing relief to the greatest number of patients possible. I'm pleased to note that our year is off to a good start. In particular, at the recent CTMS and Brain Stimulation Conference, we saw significant booth traffic which led to strong lead generation

As we continue to drive growth in 2019, our strategic priorities are as follows: First, continue the expansion of our sales force and related marketing efforts; second, continue the focus on driving long-term increases in system utilization; third, the continuing development of our next-generation NeuroStar system; fourth, beginning the clinical work to set the stage for the expansion into new indications; and lastly, launch NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in Japan and selectively evaluate entry into other international markets

Taking each of these in order, beginning with the continued expansion of our sales force and related marketing efforts. In 2019, our goal is to add an incremental 15 BDM territories, bringing our total to 59 by the end of the year. We continue to be very excited about the quality of the salespeople we're able to attract, and we feel very confident that we can continue to drive predictable growth in new system sales and subsequent pull-through as a result

In addition to the expansion of our sales force, we will continue to utilize DTC marketing campaigns throughout the year. We launched multiple campaigns during 2018, each of which allowed us to drive greater insight into the most effective ways to turn a viewer of a television ad into a patient undergoing treatment for MDD with NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. We believe that further investments will pay dividends in the form of increased patient awareness, lead generation, system sales and, ultimately, system utilization. We plan to continue to test and retest the DTC campaign in 2019. We will provide periodic updates on the details around the campaign throughout the year

Moving on to driving long-term increases in system utilization. In line with our BDM expansion and recent new system installation growth, we're also going to be adding both CPCs and CTCs throughout the year. Part of our value proposition to psychiatrists is being be able to help onboard, train and grow our practices' use of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. We plan -- our plan is to add an incremental 5 CPCs and 6 CTCs during the year, bringing the total number of CPCs to 33 and the total number of CTCs to 15 by the end of the year

Another of our strategic priorities is the development and future launch of our next-generation NeuroStar system. We are in the beginning of a multiyear process to create the next-generation NeuroStar system. As good as the system is today in meeting patients' or providers' needs, we feel it could be even better. As we prepare for the natural replacement cycle for NeuroStar systems, we're committed to maintaining our industry leadership position by continually advancing the capabilities of our system for use in both clinical and research settings. On the clinical front, we're building out our clinical science team in advance of planned discussions later this year with the FDA on clinical trials for PTSD and Bi-Polar. We believe that both of these indications represent large and underserved market opportunities that are complementary to our existing call points. Based on our initial exploration, we believe that the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system may be an effective treatment for patients suffering from these conditions

Our last strategic priority is prudently expanding our global footprint. It's estimated that there are over 300 million MDD patients globally, the significant majority of which reside outside the U.S. While our near-term focus is in Japan, we are planning to explore additional commercial expansions very selectively in Europe, in Asia in the second half of this year. We expect to receive a reimbursement decision in Japan in the second half of 2019, and we'll continue to work with our partner in Japan to be ready to launch quickly after the decision is finalized. As a reminder, there are currently no commercial revenues from Japan included in our guidance

We're very excited about the future of Neuronetics and look forward to updating you on our progress in future quarters

And with that, I'd like now to open up the line for questions

================================================================================
Questions and Answers

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair

First off, just wanted to follow up on the inputs to guidance, kind of what gets you to the low end, the high end? It seems like you are going to add more sales reps, more BDMs than originally thought, and the guidance appears relatively in line. So are you assuming maybe the sales rep productivity goes down? Or just walk us through those

Yes. I assume, Margaret, before we answer your -- this is Peter. Good morning. I assume you're referring to the full-year 2019 guidance?

Sure. I mean, just to remind you, we set our guidance based off of the model, right? And it's worked well for us. You've been following us for a while. The number of BDMs are the key driver to that model, and we put them in there at flat productivity. I was always hoping for better, but we put them in there at flat productivity. We use their -- we use historical utilization rates for the utilization based on the prior year [capacity], which is the largest [one] as well as the new installs for 2019. We assume a little bit of a decline in ASP on the treatment sessions at 3% to 5%, and as Chris indicated in his prepared remarks, there's no revenue up for Japan, right? So that's how we set up the guidance for the full year. And you're right, we do have a few additional BDMs in the plan with the total of 15 expected up for 2019. Those are staged through the year, and we put them into the model and it generated the guidance which we guided you to today

Okay. So if we kind of look at that BDMs and the fact that they outperformed for 2018 on the number of system sales, is that the historical reps versus the new reps that are coming online? And then can you speak anything to the quality of reps you're bringing on and the advertising dollars you're spending, any kind of clarity on the ROI there?

Yes. I'll take the first part, and maybe we can tag team with Chris, parts two and three. So what we have in there for the BDMs, Margaret, are they did. You're right. They slightly overperformed our expectations. And if you remember, a BDM is considered a full BDM in month 13. So there's some blending there. But if you take the blended average of the seasoned reps versus the new reps, and I think we're a little skewed right now towards the unseasoned rep, which would lower the blended rate. But what we did is we did not take into some of that overachievement in 2019 -- into our 2019 guidance. We view as kind of where we have always been, just assuming for conservative -- just take that's their productivity for the BDMs. I hope that answers the first part of your question. And then obviously, we take ASP is a big driver. If you recall, we guided to at least a few kind of low-single digits price deterioration on the capital piece, and we are pleasantly surprised. We came up at less than 1% decline. So we did build in some decline in ASP into our guidance for 2019, again, in the low-single digits, knowing that we achieved less than 1% price decline and have been 7 or 8 quarters straight of kind of record ASPs on the NeuroStars

Okay, yes. And that's helpful. Then just to follow up on the advertising ROI. If you can give us a sense of what that was in 2018, expectations for spend into 2019, knowing that you guys are trialing the steps, but it seems like you referenced maybe an ability to improve the psychiatrist customer conversion rate? So ways that you could potentially do that as well would be helpful

Yes. Sure. So good morning, Margaret. So this is really a beta that we're running, and I qualify it as a test and retest, and we're still in the learning process here. And we haven't and we don't plan to share the level of detail as it relates to the expense, but it's incorporated in our OpEx guidance as well. But I can give you a little bit better sense. So the first metric we look at is just the basic increase in traffic, and it is -- they either increase significantly or the cost -- the number -- the cost is then reduced each time we've done this to get patients to come to our website. And more importantly, we look at the leads generation, which is the physician locator searches, appointments booked online and click to call. And from our side of the funnel, and this is our side of funnel, which we feel we are optimizing each time we've done this, but we still have some work to do in converting these leads into treated patients once they go to practice, and what we've learned this most recent time around, is we found that practices that follow up quickly on patients, and remember, these patients are depressed, have a much higher conversion rate, and we're exploring opportunities to capitalize on this finding. And we'll keep you abreast of how that evolves. But we'll start talking about ROIs when we start, what I would say, investing significantly on this. And at this point, I would qualify what we're doing as a beta

And then there was one other -- to you, Chris, the second part of Margaret's original question was just on the quality of the reps. And Chris can certainly take it. From where I sit, Margaret, as we put it into the model, as we shared with you before, we're at or ahead of our hiring schedule. We were all of 2018, we are attracting kind of President's Club Winners from a lot of the larger medical device companies, where it's a lot easier to recruit when you're growing 31% have a unique technology out there. So we found that the quality of the rep and our ability to attract that talent has exceeded our expectations. So we're confident that we could fill the 15 reps, again, in 2019 at or ahead of schedule because we've done it for the last 2 years. I don't know, Chris, if you have any more to add

And our next question comes from Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities

I know you mentioned some of the meetings that you guys were at in February and it looks like the first one in Vancouver that there was a discussion of the contact sensing. And I think that's sort of one of the bigger differentiators of your technology. You mentioned a head-to-head study. So I was just curious if you'd talk to us about how big a differentiator that is? And what were the outcomes of that study?

Yes. Good morning, Dave. I think what you're referring to is we did an even factors testing that showed that [it's in four styles that were] reproducible by a NeuroStar user than it is for one of the competitors to be more reproducible in placing their magnet. And at a high level -- and we haven't published this yet. We will publish it shortly. But at a high level, it shows that the NeuroStar is much more predictable and reproducible in finding the treatment location and having the magnet aligned, and it is relatively significant. The findings generally were in the high teens, around 15% of the NeuroStar users were more precise in finding the treatment location than one of our competitors. And then in the study, we actually crossed over treaters as well and the competitors were actually much more efficient in finding the treatment location time and time again in using our system. And we have several -- and you might recall, our product was actually designed for psychiatry and high throughput device, where these products are actually neurological products that were not designed for this. And I think that came out in this human factor study. And it did bring out kind of the benefits of NeuroStar and the way it's designed versus how the competitors' product is

And two quick ones on the account base. So I think you mentioned that upgrades were a little lower in '18, but I imagine it's because most people have already decided to do so. So I guess what percent of your installed base do you think is upgraded to the faster regimen? And as a last one, you mentioned some of the ASP declined because of the high-volume accounts. So obviously, not a bad thing if you're getting a lot of volume from discounting a bit because the accounts are using it so often. I guess, any color on what percent of the installed base you kind of think is moving towards that high-volume area? Or is there today?

Yes. So we think it's about half taking advantage of the upgrade, Dave. And keep in mind, too, that beginning in the second quarter of 2017, all the systems have the 19-minute treatment session. So each successive quarter as you get past that -- April of 2017, there'll be less upgrade revenue, right, because there are less folks taking advantage of it. So we've found that it's really good for customers that are trying to manage peak load. As you can imagine, a lot of folks would like to come in before work or start their day doing treatment or come in over lunch or end their day a little early. So there's that -- it helps alleviate that. So those customers that are generally trying to manage that and it's more cost-effective than buying a second system. So those are the folks that take advantage of the treatment session upgrade technology, right? And then you mentioned -- you were talking a little bit about treatment. I want to make sure I answer all your questions. Treatment session pricing, we've been pretty consistent, Chris and I have over the course of last few quarters, of telling folks, we expect kind of mid-single digits kind of 3% to 4%, 5% range of price breaks that we give customers and reminding folks out there that this is not a discount we do to drive sales at the end of the quarter or just for promotions on these treatment sessions. These are predetermined, we negotiate with the customer, and it's all part of this surrounding the customer and partnering with them, right? So we share in their success. As the volumes goes up, we give them price breaks. And as we've said, 3% to 5% -- and that's what volumes, Dave, growing in kind of the 23%, 24%, 25% range. When you see volumes kind of growing faster or system sales growing faster, then you could see getting above the 5% range. But we're comfortable guiding that, that's where we'll be 3% to 5% kind of price breaks will take hold again in 2019 versus 2018, and we'll come back and tell you the good news, right? It's really good news because we'll trade 1 point or a few basis points of ASP on a product that's growing 95% -- has 95 -- 90% to 95% margins for us that's growing and people are taking advantage of the technology

And our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray

Just to start off with guidance to put a little bit of finer point on it. You've grown north of 25%-ish for the last 6 quarters. You're now guiding 18% to 22%. It implies a pretty meaningful deceleration in the back half of the year even though in Q1, here after toughest comp, you're still guiding very good top line growth. So I'm just wondering if there's something specifically that you're trying to call out in the back half that we need to pay attention to? Or if it's just a bit of management conservatism?

Yes. So good morning, Matt. Thanks for the question. And I'll parrot kind of first what I told Margaret. We're basing full year guidance at 18% to 22%, right? And that's all the reasons I cited to Margaret a few minutes ago. We're using all kind of historical utilization rates, historical averages, productivity. We build in some price declines as I've answered in a couple of previous questions and that spits out a number, Matt, for full year guidance in that 20% range, right? So that's where we, as a management team, want to be comfortable giving that number. For the first quarter, right, given that we're 2 months into the quarter already, we have more visibility, right? So we have a lot more confidence in projecting a higher growth rate for the first quarter relative to the annual guidance. But the annual guidance is set based on all those predicates that I pointed out on the call, which is the addition of the BDMs, their flat productivity year-over-year, some modest price declines on the capital and 3% to 5% price breaks on the treatment sessions, with no increase in utilization. Obviously, we intend to a bit overachieve on those, and we'll come back to you as we go out through the year. And if we can point to something, a trend, then we'll adjust our guidance accordingly

Okay. So you've built in quite a few leverage points then potentially, maybe if those would come through like they did in '18, there could be upside?

Let me put this together, Matt. We think about a lot of things. And so we think about the productivity of the business development managers. As we add more, could the productivity potentially decline? Could it stay the same? Could it slightly increase like it did this year? And we put that range in there, we make an assumption range on pricing, and we're making an assumption range on utilization. We consider the marketplace that we're in as well, and we put that all together and we try to be really thoughtful with it and give you a range where we feel comfortable that we're going to achieve within that range. So this is where we've come out. We've, I think, given a pretty good range for the first quarter. Our growth rate is strong coming off of Q4, and you can project from there, and we'll keep you updated quarter-to-quarter as we implement. In Q1, we'll give you an update on how we feel the rest of the year is going to go

Okay. Fair enough. Can we talk a little bit about the -- you've added so many systems in the last -- especially in the back half of last year, but over the last couple of years. It's difficult to tease out the growth rates on the treatment side for some of your more tenured facilities. So when you look at the growth rate in treatment session revenue, I think it was up 23%. Can you talk a little bit about some of the more mature centers and how they're trending as far as their growth rates go? I mean, are they growing well ahead of what you expected? Or any just kind of qualitative commentary there would be helpful

Yes. I'll start, Matt, and I'll let Chris weigh in if he needs to. If you look at the historical base, it's roughly two patients a day, right? And obviously, the new HVT strategy, once they get up and running, have 3x more potential right, round numbers. As that we just talked about, we're not factoring in that potential into our guidance, but certainly, the newer accounts are achieving ahead at a much higher level or will be at a much higher level over time, and we're starting to see some of the fruits of that strategy which is -- we're still, believe it or not, still kind of in the early innings with respect to that strategy. So we're comfortable that those accounts have a much higher potential, but we're -- we haven't given you the granularity around that just yet

Okay. Fair enough. And the last one for me. Just on the OpEx side, I mean the guide for the year was a little bit -- was more than we were modeling. And I think I get it. I think it's more on the personnel side with the BDMs, and CTCs, CPCs, et cetera. So how do we think about those investments? Is it fair to say '19 is a personnel kind of driven year above what we may have expected? And then into '20, could be more on the clinical side and then with the new indications you're going after plus next-generation technology? And I don't know if you want to talk about it or not, but do you want to give us any sense for when that next-generation product would be out?

Yes, I'll handle the quantitative stuff, and I'll let Chris come in. So I think what you said, Matt, for the most part, is pretty accurate. If you think about 2019, the largest driver versus 2018 will be the increase in personnel, right? It's the 15 BDMs. And I know of folks who were thinking it might be as low as 10 or as high as 15, and we're on the high end of that range. So that's the lion's share of the OpEx increase. And then as you think about the R&amp;D line, it's two components, which is the product development, next-gen platform. That's the second largest driver of the year-over-year increase and the largest driver within the R&amp;D line. And then there's a small component, especially, as we get into the back half of 2019 on the clinical spend, which is the two indications. You are correct that, that will ramp and start to be a little bit of a higher number as you look at to 2020 before starting to tail back down, much like most clinicals would do. And then there's a small increase, just as you think about 2018 versus 2019, Matt, in terms of the G&amp;A costs, which is the full year of public company costs. But those are 1 through 4, the drivers of the year-over-year increase and perhaps differences in how you were initially viewing our 2019

And our next question comes from Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity

This is actually Cecilia on for Jason. And I just wanted to ask kind of further around BDMs, CTCs and what you're viewing as what your current ratio and then just what would be an optimal ratio going forward? And then just thinking about 2019, how you're looking at or expecting the cadence of hires and to occur to -- of the BDMs and if this could provide upside to your guidance?

Well, let me dissect those. I didn't write them all down. If I miss any, we can circle back. So it's 15 BDMs, much like we did as our first year of a public company is we will come out, and we'll update you how many we add each quarter. What we've generally guided folks to is to use a half year convention. So 15 BDM adds would probably equate to 7 or 8 full-time equivalents over the course of the year, and we'll fine-tune that throughout the year. As far as BDMs versus CPC, we don't have a ratio on that. We basically -- we look and assess where the territories that -- where we need to add the BDMs, and we said, we've been saying consistently, we've gone from 15 to 29, 29 to 44 and, and we'll go 44 to 59. We're going to continue to add and split territories because we have full geographic coverage now. So we'll be looking to add in those territories that we think have potential in those accounts. The CPCs, again, not on a ratio basis, but you can see that we've had a little bit of leverage on the CPCs if you just take the treatment session revenue line over the number of CPCs that we've shared with you over time. At the same time, we're always -- it's not a ratio, but we're assessing the workload in those territories and the account maintenance required. Not all accounts are created equal. Some require a little bit more maintenance. So that's sort of how we view the world. We have said that the CPCs revenue per territory have historically been down, closer to $1 million, and we said, over time, that could get a little better over time. And I think if you do the math yourself, you'll see that there's a little bit of leverage going on over the last couple of years. But that's sort of how we assess the situation, and we work hand in glove with the commercial team on where they think they need help relative to the territories

Okay, great. And then if I could just ask on [OpEx] just specifically around clinical trials. You mentioned kind of seeing a little bit more of an impact from PTSD and Bi-Polar in the second half. Can you just walk us through kind of your current thinkings around timelines, what we should expect to hear from you, and then just thinking about 2020 and how that plays through?

Yes. Sure. Good morning, Cecilia. So our plan here is we're meeting with the FDA later in the year on both of these trials, and that's around the trial design. So at this point in time, I really can't comment on a timeline, and we'll keep you updated and abreast on it. But basically, we have to get, like every other company, we'd have to get our IDE approved. We'd have to enroll the patients. We'd have to assess the clinical data and then submit that to the FDA. So this is, fair to say, a several-year program for both PTSD and Bi-Polar. And as the quarters continue to advance, we'll keep you abreast of how those conversations with the FDA are and what the specific timelines are when we know them. But I think it's an exciting time for psychiatry and patients. When you think about PTSD and Bi-Polar, those two diseases, which are significant -- have significant unmet needs, both of them we know in early clinical findings have responded to NeuroStar TMS Therapy in small pilots. And we're excited about the potential of helping a group of really sick patients that don't have an alternative today. So -- and it's on our call point as well. So that's why we're kicking this off this year

And our next question comes from Alex Silverman with Special Situations

I'm wondering -- a couple of quick questions. Wondering if you could give us any sense of that $71.5 million to $76.5 million OpEx, how much of that is noncash?

Yes. The majority -- Alex, this is Peter. Just kind of making sure I fully think it through. Most of it is our cash expenses. It's personnel related to the R&amp;D efforts, the consulting efforts that go around next-gen platform, the clinical trial piece and then obviously, the sales force expansion would be all salary benefits and then the fully loaded. So I would say all if not most of it, though there's a small equity comp component in there that would lower the number, but the lion's share is cash

Okay. Secondly, given that you haven't been public that long, wondering if you could give us a sense of seasonality in terms of first quarter mix? How we should think about it?

Yes. So -- and this is evolving a little bit as well as we get larger and larger. And there's seasonality effects for sure, typically in November and December, what we see is less patients getting started in November and December because we're starting a 6-week therapy, and a lot of doctors delay, which usually leads to a slightly lower NeuroStar treatment session in the first quarter. And then usually, treatment sessions from there take off for a couple of reasons is because we have much more systems that are installed in later part of Q3 and in early parts of Q4. And I would say, in Q1 -- Q1 is a little bit compounded with NeuroStar treatment session starts because what happens is, in Q4, you can see we had a record-breaking Q4. Our system sales were up 46%, north of $4 million. It was quite the quarter. And what happens is when we get that many systems in a short period of time and many of those systems were actually backloaded into November and December, getting them up, it's somewhat -- it's a high-class problem. It overwhelms the CPCs in the short term. So in Q1, we're digging out, getting customers up and running and trained. So for those reasons, we see a little bit of softness on the NeuroStar treatment sessions. But we typically, though, see a nice bump in NeuroStar's place year-over-year because we now have 15 more BDMs in the territory in the beginning of this quarter versus last year. So typically, we see a really nice lift in NeuroStar sales in the first quarter

Okay. And that's helpful. And last question is, what's your typical length of NeuroStar sales cycle?

Yes. So that's -- we do, and we have implemented as of the beginning of last year a CRM module. Last year, we actually are now calling on a different subsegment of psychiatrists. And the -- our expectation is the deals typically close in less than 6 months. That's at a maximum length of time, and we've had deals close as quickly as 3 weeks. And a lot is deal-specific. So somewhere between 3 weeks and 6 months is the typical cycle

That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Chris Thatcher for any closing remarks

So thank you for joining us this morning. We look forward to keeping you abreast with the progress we make in 2019 in upcoming earnings calls. Have a good day

With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Neuronetics' Chief Executive Officer, Chris Thatcher

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'll start by providing an update on our performance during the first quarter followed by an update in the progress we made towards our key priorities. I'll then hand the call over to Peter to walk through our financial performance and guidance for Q2 and 2019. After which, we will provide our closing remarks before opening up the line to take the questions

The first quarter was a good start to the year as we continue to drive the adoption of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. Total revenue was $12.7 million, an increase of 25% over the prior year; primarily driven by 41% growth in the U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy revenue and 21% growth in U.S. treatment session revenue. Our growth continues to validate our strategy, our ability to execute and NeuroStar Advanced Therapy's proven clinical outcomes for patients, which offers a viable alternative for psychiatrists serving their patients with treatment resistant depression

On our fourth quarter call, we laid out our focus for the year which was to drive the adoption of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. In order to do so, we provided a list of our strategic priorities for 2019. As a reminder, these priorities are to continue the expansion of our sales force and marketing efforts, focus on driving long-term increases in system utilization, development of our next generation NeuroStar system, begin the clinical work to set the stage for the expansion of new indications and launch NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in Japan and selectively evaluate and treat into other international markets

Taking each of these in order, as we look to continue the expansion of our sales force and related marketing efforts in 2019, our goal is to add an incremental 15 BDM territories bringing our total to 59 by the end of the year. In the first quarter, we filled four of those territories, all of which are all fully trained and active. We continue to be very excited about the quality of the salespeople we're able to attract and we feel very confident that we can continue to drive predictable growth in new system sales and subsequent treatment session pull-through as a result

In addition to the expansion of our sales force, we continued to utilized DTC marketing campaigns. In 2018, we launched multiple campaigns at turning a viewer of a television ad into a patient undergoing treatment with NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. Each of these campaigns provided greater insight into the most effective way to increase patient awareness, generate leads for the practice and ultimately drive system utilization

In our most recently completed campaign, we gained further insight into campaign frequency, ad duration and the importance of the speed of practice follow-up. Leveraging those learnings and with a focus on effectively managing the patients-psychiatrist touch point, we launched a nationwide TV ad campaign at the end of the first quarter. The results we have seen so far have been excellent with significant increases in Web traffic, appointment requests and patient conversions which improved the overall cost per patient conversion

At this stage, we know that we have optimized our marketing spend to get a patient to contact a psychiatrist. We're optimistic that with each iteration we will continue to create increased demand at the more efficient rate and improve our ability to convert patients who respond to the TV campaign

Our second strategic priority for the year is to drive long-term utilization increases. As we have noted previously, we will continue to increase the number of CPC's, or clinical practice consultants, and CTC's, or clinical training consultants in order to maximize the utility of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy for our customers and patients

Our goal for 2019 is to add an incremental five CPC's and an additional six CTC's to keep up with new system sales and optimize the CPC's territories based on the uneven distribution of system sales in 2018. During the first quarter, we hired all five of the CPC's and five of the six CTC's slightly ahead of our expectations for the year

Another one of our strategic priorities is the development and future launch of our next generation NeuroStar system. We're in the early stages of a multi-year process to create the next iteration of NeuroStar system. During the first quarter, we continue to drive towards that goal as we look to maintain our industry leadership position by continuingly advancing the capabilities of our system from use in both clinical and research settings. This initiative starts with our voice of customer and fundamental research and I'm pleased to share that we've completed that and we've begun our product development process. Our fourth strategic priority for 2019 is to begin the clinical work to set the stage for expansion of indications for use for the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system. Our current focus is the build-out of our clinical science team and advance of planned discussions later this year with the FDA on clinical trials on PTSD and bipolar. This team is building out nicely and I'm pleased with the talent we're brining into this function. Our final strategic priority for the year is the prudent expansion of our global footprint. Our near-term focus is on the commercial launch in Japan. As announced in March, Japan's Central Social Insurance Medial Council has approved the recommendation by Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare to provide reimbursement for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy

The reimbursement is expected to go into effect on or about June 1, 2019. Obtaining reimbursement approval in Japan, a single-payer health care system, is a critical milestone that facilitates psychiatrists and facilities implementing NeuroStar Advanced Therapy into their treatment continuum to provide a much needed and affordable treatment alternative for MDD patients

The initial reimbursement approval for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy is expected to cover patients treated at approximately 160 of the largest in-patient and outpatient psychiatric facilities with the most comprehensive mental health services in Japan. The reimbursement rate at these facilities will be 12,000 Japanese yen per session. Initially, Teijin Pharmaceuticals, our distribution partner, will have the ability to market to the largest in-patient and out-patient centers in Japan which aligns with our market segmentation and go-to-market strategy. As of today, approximately 38 doctors from the qualifying facilities have been trained. As part of the product approval process, a physician needs to be trained by both the [JSPN] and by Teijin

While the level of reimbursement didn't come in lower than the U.S., we're comfortable that this level supports commercializing the product in Japan. I would note, that there is a process for us to collect clinical and economic data in a Japanese market subsequent to the launch that we will utilize over the next few years to try to potentially increase both the level of reimbursement as well as increase the number of facilities Teijin can sell to. While we remain enthusiastic about the Japanese market, we do not anticipate material revenue in 2019 but anticipate that revenue will grow in 2020 and beyond as Teijin sales and marketing efforts mature. Overall, we're very excited about the progress we made in the first quarter and our ability to continue to drive strong top-line growth in the business and maintain our market leadership position

I would now like to hand the call over to Peter to discuss our financial performance

Thanks, Chris. Total revenue for the quarter was $12.7 million, a 25% increase over the prior year quarter. U.S. revenue was $12.5 million, an increase of 26% over the first quarter of 2018. Outside the U.S. revenue was approximately $182,000, an increase of 1% versus the prior year period. U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue for the first quarter of 2019 was $3.4 million, an increase of 41% over the first quarter 2018 revenue of $2.4 million. The increase in U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue was primarily driven by higher capital in rent-to-own revenue. Capital units increased by 42% while average selling prices declined by 8% as compared to last year

On a sequential quarterly basis, average selling prices for capital sales were up approximately one-half of one point. During the quarter, we saw our active install base increase to 931 units, a net increase of 150 units from the first quarter of 2018; and an increase of 24 units from year-end 2018. Please note that we had an atypical number of systems go inactive during the first quarter related to a single large customer who had to return a group of their systems and these were pulled out of the active installed base

U.S. treatment session revenue was $8.8 million for the first quarter of 2019, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to an approximate 18% increase in treatment sessions purchased as well as an increase in other treatment session revenue. This was partially offset by a 3% decline in treatment session ASP's, due to predetermined volume pricing discounts within our existing customer base. This is in line with expectations and these discounts are triggered when customers surpass certain predefined high volume thresholds

U.S. service and other revenue was approximately $418,000, a 16% increase as a result of our expanded install base. Gross profit for the first quarter of 2019 was $9.9 million, an increase of $2.2 million from $7.7 million during the first quarter of 2018. Gross margin for the first quarter of 2019 was 77.9%, which was higher than the first quarter of 2018 gross margin of 75.8%. The majority of the increase in gross margin was the result of increased leverage on our service and operations cost as a result of higher sales compared to the prior year period

Sales and marketing expenses for the first quarter of 2019 were $9.6 million, an increase of a million and a half dollars over the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the increased size of our sales force spending on our marketing campaigns in support of a larger install base. General administrative expenses were $4.6 million, an increase of about $2 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased cost related to being a public company as well as legal and tax charges. Research and development expenses for the first quarter of 2019 were $2.8 million, an increase of approximately $1.2 million from the prior year period

The increase was primarily due to higher personnel and product development costs related to the commencement of our next generation platform. Net loss for the first quarter was $7.5 million, compared to a net loss of $5.5 million in the first quarter of 2018. EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure for the first quarter of 2019, was a loss of $6.4 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2018

Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalence of $96.1 million, compared to $104.6 million at year-end 2018. Cash usage during the quarter was in line with our expectations. Turning to guidance, for the full year 2019, we are reiterating our guidance of total worldwide revenue of between $62.5 million and $64.5 million, representing approximately 18% and 22% year-over-year growth respectively

For the full year 2019, we continue to expect gross margins to be in the mid 70's range, in line with full-year 2018 margins in our previous guidance. For the full year 2019, we continue to expect operating expenses to be between $71.5 million and $76.5 million primarily due to continued investment in our sales force expansion efforts, marketing, research and development related to the development of our next generation NeuroStar platform and clinical spending as we pursue additional indications; mainly PTSD and bipolar disorders

For the second quarter of 2019, we expect total worldwide revenue between $15.6 million and $16.2 million representing 18% and 22% year-over-year growth respectively. I'll now turn the call back over to Chris. Chris?

Thanks, Peter. 2019 is off to a great start as we continue to drive strong revenue growth and enable a greater number of patients to get treatment using NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. The sustained growth is a direct reflection of our ability to successfully execute in a long-term commercial strategy that we put in place in combination with the development of our industry-leading NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system for the treatment of drug-resistant depression

We're very excited about the future at Neuronetics. With that, I'd like now to open up the line for questions

================================================================================
Questions and Answers

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity

Your next question comes from the line of David Turkaly with JMP Securities

Hey, I was wondering, just as a -- I had a quick one for you about the upcoming APA meeting. I was wondering if there was anything there that you're expecting to see. Any sort of data releases or anything else like that that we can look forward to out in San Fran in a couple of weeks?

Yes. So we view this as our largest sales call of the year. We have tens of customers that were planning to meet and greet at the booth and introduce our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system to. There's a great opportunity for us to crease increased awareness around the difference in our product as well as convert our leads into sales. So we view this as our biggest sales call. There's -- we will have at the booth, we will have a series of psychiatrists talking about their experience with NeuroStar throughout the conference

Got it. And I apologize, I was hopping back and forth between a few today, but I noticed in your remarks you talked about higher capital and then also rent to own revenue. I was wondering is there any color in terms of the split where that stands today

Yes. Yes. Thanks, David. This is where we thought we'd be in total NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue. It is a little bit higher in rental and a little bit lower in capital but our ultimate goal is to expand our install base and we're able to do that in the first quarter and the mix is just slightly higher and slightly different than we had anticipated. There's no underlying trend in the business, we just had a slightly different mix than we expected

Do you want to talk a little bit about the accounting, Peter?

Yes, sure. In addition, Dave, this quarter, some of the leases were accounted for that's sales-type leases. That's opposed to operating leases. I'm sure you're seeing that elsewhere as well. The impact of this is all the revenue from the lease is recognized upfront as opposed to being recognized over the term of the lease and that's an assessment, Dave, that will have to be done each quarter. Customer by customer, lease by lease, and that could cause some volatility in the NeuroStar Therapy revenue line and at least between the categories of capital sales and rental

Got it. One last one. You mentioned the active install base, 931. Any color there? I'm just curious how many of the centers are using more than one system. And just remind us, the 931 is out of how many that you think you can actually get penetrate over time?

So David, we don't have the -- that number at our fingertips here as it relates to the number of centers that have multiple systems but it's more than a hundred, for sure, that have more than one system. And as you know, our whole goal is to increase system utilization and if you look at our system utilization we're quite proud of what we accomplished in the first quarter

System utilization is actually up and when you think about the number of system installs in Q1 versus prior year, we're up almost right around 19% in system installs with some pricing decline in NeuroStar treatment session pricing. When you think about those two numbers combined, those are really diluted to utilization and what you see is in our -- in this first quarter is utilization is actually up. So we're quite enthusiastic about our ability to ramp up our current systems with -- in the face of that dilution

Your next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair

The first one for me is maybe just a little bit more color on the one customer that you guys spoke about in the morning comments that maybe pulled (inaudible) from the field. Can you give us any more clarity around whether that's competitive, operational or something else? And then did that also impact [competitive] sales for this quarter?

Yes. Thanks for the question. So yes, this was primarily driven by one large customer and the business venture did not work out for them and the systems were pulled out of the active install base. They had a very aggressive plan to grow their business and they were not able to get the business capitalized. So these systems were low-performing systems so we don't expect any sort of material impact on loss revenues from NeuroStar treatment session going forward

It wasn't -- to finish the question, Margaret, not competitive and no impact on the quarter. Keep in mind that you know, we use a rolling year so a lot of these fell out a while back, so it's incorporated into our guidance now it backed on the quarter, not the result of a competitive situation

Okay. Perfect. And then in terms of the year-over-year utilization growth that you guys referred to on the call, can you give us a number around that and then whether or not the -- that utilization growth, how should we think about that throughout the year especially as you guys have started investing, it sounds like, in the national DTC advertising campaign?

Yes, so the utilization is mid to low single digits in the face of a 20% dilution and when we talk about dilution in this case it's a positive event, as you well know, when we're adding 18% new systems. Those systems are typically dilutive to the utilization number coupled with a several point decline in pricing. So we're quite pleased with 20% dilution that our system utilization is actually up low to mid-single digits. So, that's a good thing. You know, we're not going to forecast the next couple of quarters on utilization but we've been able to maintain this trend now for several quarters and we're quite excited about our ability to ramp our existing customers and the fact that that number is even positive is, I think, a wonderful thing based on all of the systems that we sold in the last couple of quarters

Got it. Great. And then maybe the last one for me. You referenced a little bit more mix on the rental side, I think on the last question. But in terms of other clarity on the system sales that you saw this quarter, are you continuing to see strong repeat purchases from those existing accounts, you know, those high volume focus accounts? And again, how should we think about this relative to your expectations both this quarter and throughout the rest of the year?

Yes. So we are seeing a slight increase over the last 4 quarters in second, third, fourth and 14th system purchased within our install base and we're seeing a slight increase. We're not reporting out on how we're breaking it out but most of our systems are first-time purchases in Q1

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity

Chris, can you hear me this time?

Good -- I [forgot] the mute button, sorry. So just start a couple of good questions already from my colleagues. So let's start in Japan. You -- you've commented about the reimbursement level. I just would like a bit more color on your strategy there. Let's say 2020 through 2022. I understand you're probably not willing to give us quantitative metrics but wanted your strategy nonetheless just as it relates to attempting to renegotiate reimbursement rates higher, what you think that will take and ultimately within those 160 centers you're allowed to start in, what can be the -- the treatment system utilization. What can be the market opportunity, I guess, from an [TAM] perspective within that cohort of centers?

Yes. So let's talk about our market segmentation strategy. No matter how many sites we were approved to go in to sell to, we were going to go into the highest -- the most respected psychiatric institutes in Japan and these are well-known institutes. All of these are on the list and we were planning on going into the places that have the highest in-patient and out-patient volume. So the 160 facilities are aligned with what I would call, you know, our inner bulls eye core, first mover commercial strategy and it will take us a couple of years to penetrate these facilities. We expect these facilities to be able to handle multiple NeuroStar's and they currently have tens of thousands of patients in-patient in these facilities. We haven't -- because of the new news around these 160 facilities, at this stage we don't have the total number of in-patient and out-patient but you should consider these opportunities as some of the largest psychiatric opportunities for us in the U.S. and in Japan and should model those accordingly

Now remember, we're just starting here in June and Japan is already -- Teijin has already bought a handful of more systems so they have an inventory in place and they're going to start selling aggressively come June 1. It's uncertain if they're going to order again in the back half of this year and as you know, it takes a little bit of time to get these things up and running so we won't see much NeuroStar treatment sessions probably into 2020 and beyond

So let me stop there, Jason

Okay. No. That's helpful. Second question. Just circling back to the install base. That having been said, the average install base for active units was a little lower than what we were modeling. So we just wanted to maybe have a new conversation here about what you see as the market opportunity. In our model, we're expecting you to exit the year sort of in and around a couple of hundred install, active install, higher than you are currently. So that would imply good growth of say somewhere in the range of 50 to 60 average ads per quarter. Is that the right way to think about the progress of your business through this year?

Yes. Jason, so our guidance to the market has always been take a look at the number of business development managers we have selling systems. Those have been pretty consistent for this quarter as well as for last year. And as we add more business development, as we sell more systems, and that's really how the capital equipment revenue was built, that in conjunction with rental revenue gives you all NeuroStar revenue and we're excited where we came in for the quarter at 41% growth. That's impressive NeuroStar revenue growth for us, right at where we expected

Okay, helpful. And then lastly, Peter, maybe bringing you into the conversation about the ASP's going forward, first on the (inaudible) sessions, the 3% decline was at the lower end of the 3% to 5% expectation and had been trending, I think, a little higher than that the pasts couple of quarters. What are the implications as we think about that juxtaposed to the HVT, the high value target initiative? And is the deceleration in decline due to coming up against tougher comps there? Or are you, indeed, seeing a stabilization around this level going forward do you think?

That's a good question, Jason. This is Peter. Yes. The 3% to 5% remains intact, and I think we've been pretty consistent that when the growth rate tends to be in the low 20's, which it was this quarter, 21%, and keep in mind Q1 is historically a low utilization month due to starts, right, people aren't starting after Thanksgiving so you see a slowdown in Q4 and then it's the big (inaudible) assistants that are just getting up to speed. So the 21% is in line with expectations and with that, Jason, that puts us towards the lower end of the range which is 3% and, as we've said before, when that numbers ticks up into the mid 20's or closer to 30%, then you could see -- pricing breaks that would take you above or at -- at or above the 5% range. And we've seen that in the past, so I would characterize this quarter consistent with what we were expecting and obviously right on the low end of the range

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray

Hopefully, you can hear me okay. Just wanted to follow up on the one larger customer that returned their systems to you. Is this something that you've seen historically with some customers doing something along this line? Maybe more of a single customer or two doing something like that? Just given that this was multiple systems. I'm sure that's going to draw a lot of attention among investors and they want to make sure there's nothing that's really systematically wrong with the ability to build models for a lot of these centers going forward

So this is just one customer, all right, and we've done this now -- we have over 500 customers out there. This is one customer and this is a business that had a very aggressive plan to grow their business and they didn't get capitalized to grow their business. So this is what I would say is an isolated issue. You can see what our inactive turnover rate has been historically, and historically, it's been very low. And this is just a one-off and -- but we wanted to call it out because it was a group within one customer

Got it. And then another thing that comes up quite a bit is the competitive environment and with 41% system growth in the quarter, clearly you're not seeing much of an impact at this point. I would just love if you could comment a little bit more about the landscape that you're seeing out there as far as accounts go and time that it takes to attract and close accounts. Is that growing, is it taking longer just given some more of the maybe the competitive commentary coming out. Anything along those lines that you're seeing, you know, head-to-head wins, any other commentary that you can provide there?

Yes. Sure, thanks. Thanks, Matt. So as we all know, this is a very large market opportunity. Overall, the category is well underpenetrated and we've been competing against the current market entrees anywhere from 5 to 3 years. And nothing has really changed. You know, we have a sales and marketing organization that we estimate to be four to five times the total size of all the competitors combined and we're executing as planned. We think this is a really terrific first quarter, 25% top-line growth. This is the highest revenue growth of the -- in the companies history for Q1 and 41% NeuroStar system growth. So, we feel like we're executing as planned against the competitors out there

That's fair. The last one for me, and there's 2 parts to it but -- so I'll just ask them both here. Maybe for Peter, I think you have the tough -- you just came out of the toughest comp of the year. You've put a very good performance in Q1. Didn't change guidance at all, and so I just want to make sure that's not signaling anything that you're worried about something in the last 3 quarters of the year. Maybe you could say something along the lines of feel more comfortable with the mid-point of the range or even a little bit higher end of the range. And then the other question would be, you know, given your commentary about the new system that you're investing in right now and some thoughts among investors that it's really just a pricing game kind of environment, you know, what can you add to the feature set equation that makes this bigger investment that you're making in next generation system worth it to really continue to differentiate yourself and win in this market?

Peter, why don't you take the first one?

Yes. I was going to take the first part, and then I'll pass to Chris for the second part. So to answer your question, no Matt, we feel really comfortable where we're at. We're right in line. We've got -- we give a range. We're in the midpoint of the range which is implicitly we feel really good about the [62.5 to 64.5] for the full year, and we're just executing to that plan

And then as it relates to the new system, we think that as good as our system is today, it could be better. And we're focused on feature sets to make this more efficient, more precise and more reproducible and we are looking forward to delighting customers in the future when they see this next generation system. And this system will also be compatible and able to deliver our new indications as well

That concludes our question and answer for today. I will now turn the call back to Chris Thatcher for closing remarks

Thanks for joining us on today's call, and we look forward to updating you on our next quarterly conference call. Have a good week

Ladies and gentlemen, this conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You have a wonderful day, and you may disconnect.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q2 2019 Neuronetics Inc., Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Klausner from Westwicke Partners

Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Neuronetics' Second Quarter 2019 Conference Call. A replay of this call will be available on our website for 30 days

Joining me on today's call are Neuronetics' Chief Executive Officer, Chris Thatcher; and its Chief Financial Officer, Steve Furlong

Reconciliations between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results are presented in tables accompanying our press release, which can be viewed on our website

With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Neuronetics' Chief Executive Officer, Chris Thatcher

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. Before I get started, I'd like to welcome Steve Furlong, Neuronetics' new Chief Financial Officer. Steve brings extensive medical device experience to the team, most notably having spent 14 years at Hologic, where he held a variety of senior leadership positions. We're very excited to have Steve on board as we look to continue to drive the adoption of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy and expand our market leadership position

On today's call, I will provide an update on our performance during the second quarter, followed by an update on the progress we made towards our key priorities. I'll then hand the call over to Steve to walk through our financial performance and guidance for Q3 and 2019, after which we will provide our closing remarks before opening up the line to take your questions

Our strong performance continued in the second quarter. Total revenue was $16.6 million, an increase of 25% over the prior year, primarily driven by a 30% growth in the U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy revenue and a 22% growth in U.S. Treatment Session revenue. This represents the fifth consecutive quarter since becoming a public company that we've delivered top line growth in excess of 20%

Moving on to an update on our strategic priorities for the year. As a reminder, these priorities are to continue the expansion of our sales force and marketing efforts, focus on driving long-term increases in system utilization, launching NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in Japan and selectively evaluate entry into other international markets; develop our next-generation NeuroStar system and beginning the clinical work to set the stage for the expansion of new indications

Taking each of these in order. As we look to continue the expansion of our sales force and related marketing efforts in 2019, our goal is to bring our total BDM territories to 59 by the end of the year. This will be an incremental 15 BDMs versus the end of 2018. In the second quarter, we filled an additional territory, making that 5 new territories year-to-date, bringing our current BDM territory count to 49. We continue to be very excited about the quality of the salespeople we're able to attract, and we feel very confident that we can continue to drive predictable growth in new system sales and subsequent treatment session pull-through result

We have also expanded our regional sales management infrastructure by adding 2 new BDM regions and associated regional manager. This brings the total number of sales regions to 7 as we scale to support our future growth

In addition to the expansion of our sales force, we continue to utilize DTC marketing campaigns. We finished another round of TV commercials that ran from May 13 to June 1. Following this round of commercials, web traffic was up 72% versus the previous 3 weeks without TV commercials. During this beta test, we had a new functionality to our website. Patients who responded to the ad could book an appointment on the line directly with a provider or talk live with a nurse, who could then book qualified patients an appointment. This feature was designed to increase the lead-to-consult conversion. I'm pleased to report that we saw positive trends

And comparing our cost per lead in the most recent television campaign against a similar 3-week television campaign in the fall of 2018, we generated a 5.6 reduction in our cost per lead. We're continuing to assess the financial merits of this program and further ways to continue to improve conversion of leads and the appropriate mix in our marketing strategy

As we continue to focus on driving adoption and utilization of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy, we continue to evaluate different pricing models to drive both system and treatment session sales. One such program we have utilized in certain situations is fixed-price treatment session model. The interest in this program has picked up recently, particularly as we've continued to be successful in penetrating high-volume accounts that have the resources and patient volume to drive future growth in their practice, either by adding additional systems or opening up new locations

Our second strategic priority for the year is to drive long-term utilization increases. As we've noted previously, we will continue to increase the number of CPCs, or Clinical Practice Consultants, and CTCs, or Clinical Training Consultants, in order to maximize the utilization of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy for our customers and patients

As of the end of the quarter, we're happy to share that we have already met our goal of hiring incremental 5 CPCs and 6 CTCs in 2019. This brings the total to 29 CPCs and 15 CTCs. To date, we've installed nearly 1,000 systems and once installed, our primary focus is to ensure that clinicians are well trained to optimize NeuroStar Therapy for patients by utilizing the system proprietary, patented features, including contact sensing and the 6-point alignment system. We believe that our highly trained CTCs and CPC teams are a key strategic advantage for us and that our focus on training in practice management enables our customers to effectively and consistently deliver the outcomes we generated in our clinical trials to their patients

We announced in July that the NeuroStar Outcomes Registry has passed 3,000 evaluable patients, making it now the largest registry focused on therapies for the treatment of depression. The Outcomes Registry includes data from 100 clinical practice sites across the United States and showed that 63% of patients treated with NeuroStar Advanced Therapy experienced significant improvement in the depression symptoms. This demonstrates real-world outcomes consistent results seen in the Carpenter open-label clinical trial, in which 58% of the patients experienced significant improvement. Importantly, safety data reported in our registry is also consistent with the findings of previously conducted clinical trials

Our third strategic priority for the year is the prudent expansion of our global footprint. Our initial expansion market is Japan. Earlier this year, we announced that NeuroStar Advanced therapy received national reimbursement in Japan, which went into effect on June 1. This is a tremendous achievement, and we'll provide psychiatry as a very important option to treat patients with MDD in a country that has one of the highest suicide rates in the world

We're very excited to announce that we launched commercial in Japan in the second quarter and encouraged with our early progress. The first patient was treated with NeuroStar Advanced therapy last month. Our partner Tiejin is targeting the leading teaching hospitals to the largest inpatient and outpatient clinics in Japan. The initial feedback that they provided is very encouraging. The June JSPN training course was once again filled to capacity of 150 participants. So far in 2019, over 50 additional doctors have completed Tiejin's subsequent NeuroStar TMS-specific training. In addition, a 30-minute documentary aired nationally, featuring TMS as a new technology in mid-July. Subsequent to this, Tiejin received a number of calls from hospitals, clinics and patients requesting more information

Overall, Tiejin is off to a good start in this targeted segment. And you can see in the second quarter, our OUS revenues are up nicely as a result of the most recent round of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system sales to Tiejin

Another of our strategic priorities is the development and future launch of our next-generation NeuroStar system. We're in the early stages of a multiyear process. And in second quarter, we continue to drive towards that goal. We've met with patients and physician focus groups to gain their feedback on how to improve the reproducibility, precision and efficiency of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. These insights are informing our priorities as we develop our next-generation TMS system

Our final strategic priority for 2019 is to begin the clinical work to set the stage for the expansion of indications for the use of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system. We're excited about the therapeutic opportunities that PTSD and bipolar indications will bring to our existing providers, new providers and patients globally. These are disorders that impact a significant population in the U.S. and like depression are difficult-to-treat with pharmacotherapy. We believe that in our current installed base alone, there are thousands of patients who suffer with these diseases that could potentially benefit from NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. We're currently on track to have discussions with the FDA later this year to inform our regulatory strategy. We're progressing very well against these important initiatives, which will support a continued long-term growth

Overall, we're very excited about our results in the second quarter and how we have positioned ourselves to continue to drive strong top line growth in the business and build upon our market leadership position

I would now like to hand the call over to Steve to discuss our financial performance

Thanks, Chris. Before providing the financial update, I would like to say how excited I am to join the Neuronetics' team and help realize the mission of improving the quality of life for patients who suffer from psychiatric disorders. Neuronetics has a well-defined leadership position in the TMS space and the track record of growth is truly impressive. In addition, there is still a significant untapped market for TMS, both for the treatment of MDD as well as other psychiatric disorders. And I look forward to being a part of Neuronetics as we continue to advance NeuroStar Advanced Therapy to treat these patients

Now shifting gears to our financial update. Total revenue for the quarter was $16.6 million, a 25% increase over the prior year quarter. U.S. revenue was $15.9 million, an increase of 23% over the second quarter of 2018. International revenue was approximately $682,000, an increase of 93% versus the prior year period due primarily to the sale of systems to our distribution partner in Japan

U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue for the second quarter of 2019 was $4.6 million, an increase of 30% over the second quarter 2018 revenue of $3.6 million. The increase in U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue was primarily driven by higher capital, upgrades and rent-to-own revenue. Capital units sold increased by 26%, while average selling prices declined by 9% as compared to last year. On a sequential basis, average selling prices declined by 4%

During the quarter, we saw our active installed base increase to 976 units, a net increase of 160 units from the second quarter of 2018 and an increase of 45 units from first quarter 2019

U.S. Treatment Session revenue was $10.8 million for the second quarter of 2019, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to an approximate 24% increase in the number of treatment sessions sold and an increase in other treatment session revenue. The increase in treatment sessions purchased was partially offset by a 7% decline in treatment session ASPs due to predetermined volume pricing discounts within our existing customer base. This is in line with expectations, and these discounts are triggered when customers surpass certain predefined high-volume thresholds

U.S. service and other revenue was approximately $415,000, a 1% increase over the prior year

Gross profit for the second quarter 2019 was $12.4 million, an increase of $2.4 million from $10 million during the second quarter of 2018. Gross margin for the second quarter of 2019 was 74.8%, which was lower than the second quarter of 2018 gross margin of 75.5%. The decrease in gross margin was the result of a higher mix of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy revenue as well as the selling price decrease as noted above, partially offset by increased leverage on our service and operations cost as a result of higher sales compared to the prior year period

Sales and marketing expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were $11.5 million, an increase of $1.7 million over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the increased size of our sales force as well as spend related to marketing campaigns. General and administrative expenses were $4.3 million, an increase of approximately $1.2 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the increased costs associated with being a public company

Research and development expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were $3.2 million, an increase of approximately $0.9 million from the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to product development costs related to the continued development of our next-generation platform and higher personnel costs in preparation of new clinical trials

Net loss for the second quarter was $7.1 million compared to a net loss of $7.5 million in the second quarter of 2018

EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, for the second quarter of 2019 was a loss of $5.9 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $6.3 million in the second quarter of 2018

Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $89.6 million compared to $104.6 million at year-end 2018. Cash usage during the quarter was in line with our expectations. I would like to note that since we are now eligible to utilize Form S-3, the company will file a shelf registration statement for the offer and sale of up to $125 million of securities on a primary basis. In addition, this shelf registers 3.5 million shares that may be offered and sold by shareholders on a secondary basis pursuant to an investors' rights agreement. The filing of this shelf should not be interpreted as an indication that we will be pursuing a financing in the near term. Rather, this is just a matter of good corporate housekeeping

Turning to guidance. For the full year 2019, we are increasing our guidance of total worldwide revenue to between $63 million and $65 million, representing approximately 19% and 23% year-over-year growth, respectively, up from our prior guidance of $62.5 million to $64.5 million and inclusive of our expectations for international revenue for the year

For the third quarter of 2019, we expect total worldwide revenue of between $15.8 million and $16.4 million, representing 15% and 19% year-over-year growth, respectively

For the full year 2019, we continue to expect gross margins to be in the mid-70s range, in line with our previous guidance

For the full year 2019, we now expect operating expenses to be between $74 million and $77.5 million, up from the previous guidance of $71.5 million to $76.5 million. The small increase in operating expense guidance is primarily driven by our ongoing efforts to drive adoption, including the continued investment in our sales force expansion efforts, marketing, research and development related to the development of our next-generation NeuroStar platform and clinical spending as we pursue additional indications for PTSD and bipolar disorders

I'll now turn the call back over to Chris. Chris?

Thanks, Steve. We're very happy about our performance during the first half of 2019, as we have consistently demonstrated the execution of our growth strategy and achieved our financial objectives. Our ability to sustain growth is a direct reflection of our ability to successfully execute on improving long-term commercial strategy that we put in place in combination with the ongoing development of our industry-leading NeuroStar Advanced therapy system for the treatment of drug-resistant depression and potentially new indications. As we look to the second half of 2019 and into 2020, we believe our strong foundation in the U.S. as well as our recent expansion internationally sets the stage for continued growth

With that, I'd like now to open up the line for questions

================================================================================
Questions and Answers

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity

I look forward to seeing you over the next couple of days at our conference. So Chris first, congratulations on a great quarter. I wanted to ask you about the juxtaposition of your upside growth in treatment session revenue which -- or treatment session procedures, which has been quite strong frankly for several quarters now. And then that juxtaposed to the treatment session ASPs. So I know that your policy has been to offer volume discounts and seemingly happy to do it given treatment session revenue procedures are growing so fast. But how should we think about this juxtaposition, let's say, over the next couple of years? Are we going to continue to see this level of volume discount pricing? Or will that moderate a little bit? I just can't help but think that with this level of growth in procedures, if ASPs were more in line with your long-term view of sort of 3%, 4%, that the numbers could be even bigger. And I just wanted your thoughts on that

Right. So thanks, Jason, looking forward to seeing you on Thursday at Canaccord conference. As it relates to our general guidance, we've generally guided mid-single-digit declines in ASP for NeuroStar treatment session and that will -- the decline in ASP will increase if our volume expectations are higher than we assumed in our guidance because along with higher volumes, providers get greater decreases. And if our treatment session approach should slow, then our price decline would be less in a given quarter. And that's played out consistently for the last 4, 5 quarters. So we've had another nice unit volume uptick again this quarter. And in return, the pricing decline for NeuroStar treatment sessions is slightly higher than our guidance. And that's going to remain fairly consistent. Over time, right, over time, over a year or 2, as that installed base gets larger, those price declines could be tempered longer term because they are weighted out

So to follow up on that, I mean obviously, you're not going to give the treatment sessions away. So there's going to be a diminishing returns to the ASP declines, if you will, I would assume even for the higher volume guys, right? I mean are you going to continue to offer the same level of price breaks for, let's say, the same person they got, let's say, a 10% reduction in price this year if they grow treatment session revenue in their own practice 20% to 30%? Again next year, will they also see the same level of price cuts? Does that make sense?

Yes. So just to be clear, so our pricing program and plan is based on volume, we don't have many one-off agreements on pricing. So -- and we don't renegotiate pricing every year. So when they hit a maximum volume, the price does not continue to decline year after year

Okay. Great. I'll move on. Just one quick other category. I mean I was interested to see your updated operating expense guidance. The spending on PTSD and bipolar. You mentioned a little bit in your prepared remarks, but I would be interested and I think investors are interested in this sort of indication expansion opportunity. And maybe a bit more color on what your timing expectations are? What nuances you expect with respect to a clinical study? And just in general, maybe a bit more color on the target addressable market opportunity you see ahead in these markets as opposed to a market in OCD that one of your competitors is approaching? Congrats on a good quarter

Yes, thanks. So the first thing is, this is a large unmet need, both PTSD and bipolar. Directionally, these markets in total are just slightly smaller than the MDD market. This represents not only a big unmet need, but it also allows us to leverage our installed base. Psychiatrists treat PTSD and bipolar as well as MDD and they're prevalent within their practices. So this is a terrific same-store growth opportunity for us

That said, we're planning a study that's going to be a large study. These are going to be RCT studies, and these will be designed to address several things. One, the FDA's need. Second is they'll also be designed for -- to separate clinically in a way that's compelling for providers to use the technology. And then lastly, it will be designed to be compelling for financial payers to pay for it. So these are -- when we take a product to market, I've said this before, the difference between a product and a business is you have to get reimbursement. And without reimbursement, it's just a product, patients can't afford it, doctors can't afford to deliver it

So when we do a clinical trial, we think about the whole continuum as I outlined there. These are much bigger markets than OCD and you need typically larger studies that were provided -- that were provided for OCD to get reimbursement in play. So that's our thoughts on the category. We're really excited about this opportunity, and we're just kicking off the process now

Your next question is from the line of Matthew O'Brien from Piper Jaffray

Welcome, Steve, to your new role. I wanted to start with the fixed pricing commentary on the modeling side. I would just love to hear a little bit more about what you're doing there and then kind of how that flows through the P&amp;L? And how we should think about that influencing numbers over the next several quarters?

Yes, Matt. Yes, sure. So we wanted to comment on this because I know that we've had some questions on the U.S. Treatment Session revenue number. So just to break this down is, we've also provided commentary on the increase and the decrease in volume and price relative to prior year. I know everyone's tracking that in your models. And if you've been tracking our historical volumes and price and you utilize our reported growth rate that we share each quarter, you're going to calculate a number that is typically lower than we report in U.S. Treatment Session revenue. And that difference is what we call other treatment session revenue, which is comprised of revenue from fixed-price contracts and other ancillary components. And we want to provide you that color here today in the call

Okay, Chris, but I think you said that the interest level in that fixed pricing model is lifting. Can you just talk a little bit more about, again, why that is? And so I think a lot of people on the call are really trying to understand the whole competitive dynamic and make sure that with that commentary plus the pricing declines that this isn't a result of you having to be more aggressive in the marketplace to get more customers and more treatment session volume

Yes. So just to be clear, the fixed pricing model is not reflected in any ASP decline. Fixed pricing model just goes to total treatment session revenue. So they're not -- they're not interacting at all. So this is a function of what I would call a positive signal to our successful HVT penetration. This is for the best HVT targets. And we're learning how to best really partner with this customer to create a successful NeuroStar program with them. And at this point, I think -- I hope you understand, we're not going to get into all the specifics for competitive reasons on a public call, but this is definitely an emerging sales strategy for us, and we wanted to highlight it here, and I think it validates our HVT strategy overall that these larger accounts are very interested in buying multiple systems at multiple locations and working with us over a longer period of time in a contracted fashion

Got it. Okay, that makes sense. And then the other question I had was just on the international performance. So the guidance lift for the year is really just a function of a little better visibility with what you're doing with Tiejin. And first of all, is that true? And then secondly, can you just talk a little bit more about kind of the cadence of sales into Tiejin with there a big bulk of systems placed and sold here in Q2, and you won't see that in Q3, Q4? Just any kind of color there would be helpful?

Yes. Thanks, Matt. So we're excited about Japan. I'd call it tempered enthusiasm. We're in a fuzzy front end of a commercial launch. Actually, Tiejin has done a very good job during the precommercialization phase, and it's paying off. Overall, they're off to a good start in this targeted segment. As you can see in Q2, our OUS revenues are up nicely, a result of the most recent round of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy systems sales to Tiejin. I'd also note that our increased annual guidance range does not reflect our revenue expectations for the year for Japan. I'm sorry, it does now reflect our revenue expectations for the year for Japan. So that's included in our annual guidance

Okay. So you lifted it because of Japan specifically. Is that the right way of viewing it?

Yes, the remainder of the year, what we think is going to happen

Your next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair

First, maybe a bigger picture strategic question. We talked through some of the more tactical strategic decisions that you guys are doing in terms of vis-à-vis with education and some of these new pricing models. But if we think about some of the bigger, longer-term strategic decisions that really get TMS more broadly adopted and maybe even accelerated from the point where you're at. What measures are those? What are you doing on those measures? Is it price, reimbursement, data? And do you still have room in those high-value accounts that you guys have focused on for the last year or 2?

Yes. So thanks for the question, Margaret. Our growth strategy is pretty straightforward. This is a really large market as we all know. It's underpenetrated and our ability to grow and get the patients is about hiring more people, selling more systems. And we're at the cusp of an amazing milestone, almost 1,000 systems, but that's really just a drop in the bucket. We're in the low single digits of penetration, the number of patients that we can treat, mid-single digits in the number of locations that have our systems. And this is just about us commercializing in the U.S. and continue to sell systems and demonstrate that when we hire people, we sell more systems

If we sell more systems, we treat more patients. And that is really the strategy for the next 36 months in the U.S. And then the continued growth that will come from outside the U.S. and Japan. And as we indicated, we're looking at other select thoughtful commercialization paths outside the U.S. And then right around that period of time, then we would come out with a new system that's really going to wow providers and set a new high bar for what people think about in a TMS system. And then shortly on the heels of that, PTSD and bipolar and 2 new indications. That's our growth strategy, and we're not changing

And I know something that you have a lot interest, we have a lot of interest is, we still think that there's an opportunity in the direct-to-consumer marketing campaign. We've made some good steps this past flight of TV and reducing our cost and increasing our lead-to-consults conversion rates by adding some new functionality and some new learnings. So that's our strategy. I don't think there's really a silver bullet here. I just think that it's good commercial execution as we've outlined

Got it. So maybe switching over to guidance for a second. You guys had growth of 25% this quarter. Overall, third quarter guidance has implied kind of the 15% to 19% range. And that implies fourth quarter growth comes in, I think, a little bit slower than third quarter growth. So maybe walk us through the comps this year. What this means for the U.S. as well as for international? And I guess, more importantly, how does it set up for 2020 and beyond? Do you guys continue to view yourself, I guess, as a 20-percent-plus top line grower going forward?

Yes. So the guidance demonstrates a full year growth now between 19% and 23%, which is slightly higher than our original guidance. Q3 has been typically a sideways and sometimes down quarter. And this is a seasonal fluctuation that we've seen in the past. And you can back into our Q4 number, which is in line with full year expectations. And from there, you can start to model Q1 in 2020, and we're not going to get into guidance for 2020, but you can quickly see based on history, what that sets up Q1 to look like. So we're guiding right now from 19% to 23%, which puts us on track to be a continued 20% grower through the end of the year. And as we move into 2020, we'll provide guidance on 2020

Okay. Yes. And I guess just one last one in terms of capital placements. I'm not sure if you guys can give us any kind of breakdown from capital sales going to existing accounts versus some of the new center openings and then are you continuing to see those repeat sales with the existing accounts continuing to drive that above-average utilization? Seems like it, but just double-checking. And as we look at volatility on pricing within capital, should we assume very much? Or is this kind of the new level going forward?

Yes. So we've given all the metrics to determine our installed base, how big our installed base and our NeuroStar treatment sessions. And you can see that once again, our installed base is up 20% over prior year. And utilization rate is up again in this quarter. So we don't report out on the systems that we're selling to existing customers versus new customers. And we haven't broken out our NeuroStar treatment sessions by customers, but we're giving you enough metrics that you can see that even adding 20% more volume to our installed base, that our utilization rates are up, that 20% is really dilutive, right, on a per system utilization rate seeing that they just got the systems. So we're quite excited about the utilization rates within our business, consistent growth rate now for 5 quarters, 20-plus percent NeuroStar treatment session, 30% on NeuroStar's, 25% overall, 5 quarters over 20%, taking up guidance, we're quite enthusiastic about what we're accomplishing here

That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the call back to Chris Thatcher for closing remarks

Thanks for joining us this morning. We look forward to updating you on our next quarterly call

The company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the course of this call, except as required by law

During the call, we'll also discuss certain financial information on a non-GAAP basis that includes EBITDA. Management believes that non-GAAP financial information taken in conjunction with U.S. GAAP financial measures provide useful information for both management and investors by excluding certain noncash and other expenses that are not indicative of our core operating results. Management uses non-GAAP measures to compare our performance relative to forecast and strategic plans to benchmark our performance externally against competitors and for certain compensation decisions

Reconciliations between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results are presented in tables accompanying our press release, which can be viewed on our website

With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Neuronetics' Chief Executive Officer, Chris Thatcher

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. On today's call, I will provide an update on our performance during the third quarter, followed by an update on a few operational aspects of the business. I'll then hand the call over to Steve to walk through our financial performance and updated guidance for Q4 and the full year, after which we will provide our closing remarks before opening up the line to take your questions

Total revenue in the quarter was $16 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year primarily driven by an 18% growth in the U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy revenue and 11% growth in U.S. treatment session revenue. Results during the quarter were at the lower end of our expectations due to slightly lower productivity in our legacy customer base. This quarter was another very positive quarter for our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system and was the sixth consecutive quarter in a row that the active installed base increased by approximately 20% over the prior year quarter. This demonstrates our ability to consistently execute our strategy and the significant potential in what is still a relatively untapped market

On today's call, I'd like to focus my remarks on the following topics: The ongoing expansion of the BDM, CPC and CTC field sales forces; trends among HVT customers and in particular, TMS-only providers; marketing initiatives designed to raise awareness of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy; the early progress we're seeing in Japan and our plan to expand into new indications beyond major depressive disorder

Starting with an update on our BDM sales force. Our goal remains to bring our total BDM territories to 59 by year-end, which would be an increase of 15 versus the end of 2018. In the third quarter, we filled an additional 8 new territories and now have 13 of the 15 expansion territories filled year-to-date, bringing our current BDM territory count to 57. We have also been continuing to build a number of CPCs, or clinical practice consultants, and CTCs, or clinical training consultants, in line with the growth of our installed base. These teams are an important part of the value proposition that we offer customers to ensure that customers are supported in training and building a practice to maximize the utility of the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System

As of the end of the quarter, there are 33 CPCs and 15 CTCs in the field, and both of these cohorts are in line with our expectations for the size of these groups at the end of 2019. Going forward, the CPC will be referred to as a NeuroStar Practice Consultant or NPC, better recognizing the value they bring to our customer. This team's primary focus is working with our customers to help them drive treatment session volume

While we are trending well with new provider volume growth, we have found that we need to spend a bit more time with our legacy providers as they are not performing as well as expected. We are revisiting our call point cycles and anticipate this will take some time to optimize

I would now like to discuss some trends we observed at a few of our larger HVT accounts. As you may have seen through recent press releases, we're experiencing rapid growth with TMS-only providers who take patient referrals from psychiatrists in the community that don't currently offer TMS. They do their own local marketing and efficiently convert our DTC efforts

In September, we announced that our 100th system was installed with Greenbrook TMS, a NeuroStar Advanced Therapy provider with 82 treatment centers across the U.S. In October, we announced that we have agreed with Success TMS to be the preferred TMS technology at over 21 locations across 21 states. We're pleased that these large providers, which are multimillion dollar business entities, are choosing to partner with us over other companies in the TMS space. As these and other large providers expand, they often place multiunit orders, which would require a significant cash outlay. As a result, these customers are choosing to utilize rent-to-own agreements for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems, which spreads the cash outlay over time and allows them to expand more quickly

This has led to a significant increase in other NeuroStar revenue during the quarter. These rent-to-own systems are accounted for as sales-type leases and have a lower ASP than a traditional capital sale

During the quarter, we also saw a significant uptick in other treatment session revenue, the primary driver of which is a rapid increase in the number of new systems being activated for HVT customers who utilize fixed price purchase agreements. We view this as a positive indicator of the demand for our therapies among these high volume centers, and we'll continue to opportunistically offer this pricing model to customers who feel that they can drive high volumes of patients and thus, multiple new system purchases over time through their practices

We're pleased with how our HVT strategy is playing out. Our ability to successfully partner with larger providers will allow us to continue to expand our installed base and drive predictable high-margin treatment session revenue

To help support practice utilization, we're continuing to utilize DTC marketing campaigns to expand awareness of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. We recently ran a national TV ad campaign in conjunction with National Depression Awareness month to leverage the spotlight on MDD to increase the awareness around NeuroStar Advanced Therapy and how we can help patients who are suffering

As a reminder, there are over 17 million adult Americans and over 300 million people worldwide that are depressed. However, less than half will see treatment, which is why increasing awareness of depression and the treatment options is critical

The October campaign was one of our most successful to date. Appointment requests increased 64% and physician located searches increased 33% over our May 2019 campaign. While we are thrilled with these results, we continue to look for ways to optimize the financial return on these campaigns

We're about to take those learnings and embark on expanded DTC pilot tests from mid-November through January next year. You may recall that in May, we ran a very successful pilot test where potential patients who responded to a commercial were directed to a call center. The clinical consultants at the call center determined if the patient would be a good candidate for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy, and if so booked the patient an appointment directly with a nearby NeuroStar psychiatrist. The purpose of this new pilot will be to determine the ROI on our DTC campaigns with a call center component before deciding how we best move forward

I'd like to update you on the expansion of our global footprint. As we announced earlier this year, NeuroStar Advanced Therapy received national reimbursement in Japan, which went into effect on June 1. The first patient was treated with NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in July. Subsequent to that, we have had good early commercial traction. Teijin placed another multisystem order in the quarter as they're beginning to get early adopters up and running

The sale of these systems was factored into our guidance for the year, although we were not sure whether the sales would occur in the third or fourth quarter. We currently don't have any additional system sales built into our outlook for the fourth quarter in Japan. We continue to view Japan as a high potential geography, but do not expect revenue -- but do expect revenues to be lumpy over the near-term as we work with our partner, Teijin, to increase awareness, get psychiatrist trained on the system, get systems installed and ultimately drive treatment session revenue

Lastly, I'd like to discuss the future expansion of indications for use for the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System. We're currently working with the FDA to determine the best regulatory path forward to expand our indications to include bipolar and PTSD. We expect to have some clarity on this pathway in early 2020, and we'll be able to share more at that time

The TMS market is still in its nascent stages, and the technology continues to gain popularity among psychiatrists, health care providers and patients. We're enthusiastic about the success we're having with their HVT strategy and our rapidly expanding active installed base. Overall, we believe that we remain well positioned to continue to drive top line growth in the business and build upon our market leadership position over the long term

I'd now like to hand the call over to Steve to discuss our financial performance

Thanks, Chris. Total revenue for the quarter was $16 million, a 16% increase over the prior year quarter. U.S. revenue was $15.3 million, an increase of 13% over the third quarter of 2018. Outside the U.S., revenue was approximately $700,000, an increase of approximately $490,000 versus the prior year quarter. U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenue for the third quarter of 2019 was $4.6 million, an increase of 18% over third quarter 2018 revenue of $3.9 million

As a reminder, this revenue line is comprised of NeuroStar Capital revenue, which is revenue from systems sold and other NeuroStar revenue, which has 3 primary components: Sales-type lease revenue; operating lease revenue; and revenue from upgrades to the 3.0 treatment coil

As Chris discussed, there were significantly higher number of sales-type leases in the quarter, which led to other NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenue of approximately $1.6 million during the quarter as compared to approximately $500,000 during the third quarter of 2018, representing 240% growth. NeuroStar Capital revenue in the quarter was driven by a 6% decrease in capital units sold and a 10% decline in average selling prices as compared to last year. On a sequential basis, average selling prices declined by 3%

During the quarter, we saw our active installed base increase to 1,032 units, a net increase of 174 units or 20% from the third quarter of 2018 and a net increase of 56 units sequentially. As a reminder, the active installed base includes capital units sold, sales-type leases and operating leases

U.S. treatment session revenue was $10.3 million for the third quarter of 2019, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to an increase in other treatment session revenue, which represents our fixed price treatment session revenue. Per click treatment sessions purchased in the quarter grew by approximately 8%. This increase was partially offset by a 6% decline in treatment session ASPs due to predetermined volume pricing discounts within our existing customer base

During the quarter, other treatment session revenue was $1.4 million, up from $512,000 during the third quarter of 2018, representing over 170% growth. U.S. service and other revenue was approximately $426,000, a 9% increase over the prior year

Gross profit for the third quarter 2019 was $11.8 million, an increase of $1.1 million from $10.7 million during the third quarter of 2018. Gross margin for the third quarter of 2019 was 73.8%, which was lower than the third quarter of 2018 gross margin of 77.9%. The decrease in gross margin was the result of a higher mix of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy revenue and lower average selling prices as a result of a higher portion of new systems placed as sales-type leases

Sales and marketing expenses for the third quarter of 2019 were $10.4 million, an increase of approximately $700,000 over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the increased size of our sales force as well as spend related to marketing campaigns

General and administrative expenses were $4.3 million, an increase of approximately $1 million compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by increased compensation-related expenses. Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2019 were $3.5 million, an increase of approximately $1.4 million from the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to product development costs related to the continued development of our next-generation platform and higher personnel costs in preparation of the clinical trials

Net loss for the third quarter was $6.9 million compared to a net loss of $5 million in the third quarter of 2018. EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure for the third quarter of 2019, was a loss of $5.6 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $3.8 million in the third quarter of 2018

Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $82.4 million compared to $104.6 million at year-end 2018

Turning to guidance. For the full year 2019, we are reducing our guidance of total worldwide revenue to between $62 million and $63 million representing approximately 17% and 19% year-over-year growth, respectively, down from our prior guidance of $63 million and $65 million. The primary driver of the reduction in full year revenue guidance is lower-than-expected average selling prices and lower-than-expected volumes in certain existing customers

For the fourth quarter of 2019, we expect total worldwide revenue of between $16.7 million and $17.7 million, representing 7% and 13% year-over-year growth, respectively. For the full year 2019, we continue to expect gross margins to be in the mid-70s range, in line with our previous guidance. For the full year 2019, we now expect operating expenses to be between $73.5 million and $75.5 million, down slightly from our previous guidance of $74 million to $77.5 million

I'll now turn the call back over to Chris. Chris?

Thanks, Steve. We continue to be very excited by the opportunity for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy to help a significant number of patients worldwide who suffer from major depressive disorder. We're pleased with our success in partnering with some of the largest HVT providers and enthusiastic about this segment of the market and our leadership position. We continue to optimize our industry-leading commercial infrastructure to support our expanding customer base and our marketing efforts to raise awareness of TMS as a treatment for those suffering from depression

Longer term, we're enthusiastic about our ability to expand indications to bring relief to an even greater number of patients suffering from psychiatric disorders

With that, I'd like now to open up the line for questions

================================================================================
Questions and Answers

(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair

First question for me is along the lines of guidance. I know you guys aren't providing 2020 guidance. But I guess what I'm hoping for is you can provide us a little bit of a sense of the moving pieces as you go into 2020. Should we assume that growth is similar to what you're seeing in the second half of this year, better than that, and kind of walk us through the moving dynamics, whether it's leasing, utilization, et cetera?

Yes, Margaret, thanks for the question. So we're -- to your point, we're not going to provide any guidance on Q4. So we can talk a little bit more -- I'm sorry, we're not going to talk about next year, we're going to talk a little bit more about Q4, as you like. But the primary softening in Q4 is a function of lower utilization rates in some of our legacy customers, and we expect our NeuroStar system volume to come in as we expected to our guidance. But the issue is that the rent to owns are significantly higher, and those are lower ASP. So those are the fundamental drivers for us taking down the guidance next year -- I'm sorry, in Q4 this year

Got it. Yes. And so let's maybe hit on those 2 items a bit. So first of all, legacy NeuroStar accounts, you referenced that maybe you're seeing some lower productivity than you expected. Have you given or seen any consistent reasons why maybe a sense of profile or scale? And then does that Q4 guidance assume that utilization within these legacy accounts improves from what you've seen in the third quarter, stay the same or gets worse?

Right. Yes. So the lower utilization really is a result of our over-indexed shift of the NPC team towards the recently sold systems. If you think about it, we've installed 174 systems in the last 12 months, which the -- new systems and 280 over the last 7 quarters. And what we're revisiting right now is the NPC call cycle has been shifted towards those 280 systems, and we need to go back and recircle on our legacy customer utilization. I don't see this being a long-term issue. These are experienced users who we need to revisit and review their practice development plans

Okay. And then just one last one in terms of leasing dynamic. As we look out, do you see these sales-type leases increasing going forward? And how should we really look at the mix of sales versus leases and the ROI of those investments?

Yes. So we offer the flexibility of a rent-to-own option for these reasons, is to minimize the upfront barriers to these larger accounts. So we can -- so they can expand to new sites faster, which ultimately gets us to more treatment session sooner. We would expect this trend to continue and I think that this further validates the strategy. I would not categorize this as a fundamental shift in our strategy. It's really a partner and execution of our existing customer segmentation strategy. But you can expect this to continue to move forward -- to continue into Q4 and beyond

Your next question comes from Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity

Several questions, I'll try to limit it a little bit but. Chris, talk about the competitive landscape. We've seen growth slow here. And we've also seen new competitors coming to the market over the last 12 months or so. Has that had any impact or been one of the reasons we've seen slowing growth? Could you just comment about wins or losses in the space and whether or not you've seen any regrettable departures of large customers or competitive ire is having any impact on your business at all?

Yes, Jason, thanks for the question. So the fundamental competitive dynamics really hasn't changed very much as we look at how we're performing in the marketplace. And I think that's really indicative of -- this is now our sixth consecutive quarter where we've increased the install base by 20%. And so we feel like we're operating pretty well in the marketplace

The primary drivers to the lower-than-expected guidance in Q4 is just a function of not lower systems placed and sold into the market, it's really around the ASP around those systems in the market and in a softening of our existing customers. We have really -- when you think about the growth rate that we had over the last 7 quarters, 280 systems placed, that's putting a lot more demand on the NPCs. And in a lot of businesses, and particularly in the pharmaceutical business, you have a sales call rotation with your reps, and you need to keep reinforcing behaviors. And what we're starting to recognize is we were under-indexed with our legacy customers and we would expect it to not get better in Q4, and we're moving the NPC team on an increased call cycle for our existing customer base moving forward. And we'll see how that plays out within that group

But this is not a competitive issue. I would say that this is -- when you look at the fundamentals of this business, our install base has grown 20%, the clinical performance is strong. It's still a nascent untapped market, and this is just growing things as we've rapidly expanded and penetrated new customers. And we got to get our call point ratio right between existing customers and new customers, and we're just a little bit off at the moment

Okay. I mean that makes some sense, Chris. So how long do you expect, maybe you could give us a peek behind the curtain just a little bit. And I'm going to push you a little bit on 2020 because otherwise, the Street is going to value you as a 10% grower and -- given your fourth quarter guidance. And it sounds to me like you see yourself as something north of a 10% grower, and -- over the longer term

But I guess the question is, how long does it take to sort of not change the business model, but adapt to the business model from a sales force perspective with these NPCs. It sounds like the model's changing. That the legacy providers were sort of left on their own volition and sort of they didn't fall down, but they slowed down. And they need a bit more handholding, for a lack of a better way to put it. And it sounds like you expect that once those changes are instituted and you are providing better support for legacy customers, that you see growth accelerating within those customers, which at this point in time is still a relatively material piece of your business, which is why it's being reflective in lower guidance in the nearer term

Perhaps you could talk about those dynamics a little bit more and talk about what is the prudent way to model growth in the overall franchise in 2020, given the puts and takes. And I understand you're not ready to give official guidance, but I think it behooves you to talk at least directionally

Right. So let me see if -- I'm going to try to help you out as best I can, Jason. So what are we doing right now? So we're assessing our deployment as part of our annual operating plan process. And we know for sure that we're going to add in 2020, we got to rebalance some of our NPC territories. We do this every year because of unequal and disproportionate number of new system sales going into 1 rep versus another

So we're going to add more NPCs next year, we did it this past year as you know. And I think the other thing is we need to look at either adding more CTCs and NPCs because the install base is increasing 20%, and just by definition, that means we're selling more systems year-over-year when your -- when that base is increasing 20% year-over-year. And we got to find a better balance. So we're very thoughtful, as you know. So we're going through a process here over the last several weeks to understand our call cycle frequency and how much we move. And then we're going to have to test and retest and see how fast we can move the needle on it

The good news is, right -- this is not customers that we've lost, this is customers that have trended down. They have a system. They're committed to it. And we just got to get back in there and revisit and review their practice development plans and reengage them. So this is more of a behavior versus what I would call a material environmental issue around the business. This is what I'd call just growing pains. And we shifted the team potentially too hard to these new customers, these 280 new customers, and we've got to revisit the call cycle

And I -- so this is going to take some time for us to figure out and test and retest, and we'll give you a better insight into it. But let's be clear, I mean you can project the current Q4 revenues and compare that to Q1 and Q2 and that's not going to be a 10% grower, right? The business is not going away. We just have a softening in 1 segment of our customer market. And you can see that we're adding systems as fast as we've ever had in the history of the company. So the underlying fundamentals are strong

Okay. Great. And lastly, so it sounds like just to push on that a little bit more, it sounds like you're expecting the first half of the year to improve modestly relative to fourth quarter levels and that your comps are going to be easier in the second half of the year. And with the addition of these new systems, it sounds like you might even see sequential improvement second half of '20 versus first half. So improvement as you're moving through 2020. Am I hearing that right?

Jason, we're focused on finishing the year, and we're in the process of creating our operating plan. I can't really get into specifics around 2020 at this point in time. I think we've got, again, a strong install base. I've indicated in Q4 that the number of systems that we expect to install are in line with our prior guidance of 63 to 65, but we're taking our guidance down because of lower ASPs associated with those NeuroStar systems as we get into these bigger accounts, that the primary shortfall on NeuroStar's in Q4 and then further softening of our -- a subsegment of our customer group, which is our legacy customers. And then that's going to take some time to square away, and I'm not quite sure how long it's going to take, but it's going to take us beyond Q4 probably to square that away

Your next question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray

Chris, can you talk a little bit more about those legacy accounts? I mean how do you really qualify what a legacy account is? Is that something you've held for 2, 3 years? Or is it -- and how do you think about what visibility do you have as far as what kind of opportunity you have there, if they've bought a competitive product and how quickly you can turn these guys back on?

Yes. So when we think about the legacy customer group, we think about customers that acquired systems beyond 3 years and that they're up and running. And one of the advantages we have versus maybe some other medical device companies is we have pretty good transparency because most of our NeuroStar treatment session volume is done through the cloud. So we can see actual utilization trends over a period of time and see their purchases. There you see the utilization real-time versus their purchases real time

So what we're doing, Matt, is we're just going back. We're looking at these customers, they fall into 3 groups, customers that are trending below our expectations at and above and what we're going back to is the people that are trending below our expectations that have the highest volume, the highest impact is where we're circling our NPCs back to. We always factor in every year a number of, what we call, hybrid customers, customers that have competitive products in our product. We also factor in lost business. And we don't feel that those 2 metrics are off

This is just a function of -- and again, I'll say, we've seen this before in my pharmaceutical days is you can call on your high-volume docs, but you've got to go back and continue to maintain, and I think that we've shifted too far towards the most recent install class and those 280 units that we put in over the last 7 quarters, and we just need to spend a bit more time with this customer group. And remember, this legacy customer group is not the high-value target group, right? These are the customers that we brought on in early days, and we just need to spend a bit more time with them. And that's just another reason why we're moving to these higher volume targets because operationally, they can keep it rolling and these are smaller accounts, typically, that we -- our time and effort makes a difference in those accounts

Okay, that's helpful. And then when you talk about maybe slicing this a little bit differently, the accounts you've added maybe over the last year that they have been using for a year to maybe up to 3 years. So little bit more focused on the NPC side. Do you have any sense, and I would imagine you do, given that it's all done in the cloud, what kind of growth you've seen from those accounts on the session side? Has it been high teens, 20% kind of growth out of that group, maybe over the last year or so?

Yes. We haven't aggregated -- we haven't disaggregated that on these calls. But I will tell you that relative to guidance, they're performing as we expected, those groups. I will go a step further and tell you that our fixed price contracted customers are growing significantly faster than our average customer in terms of utilization

Okay. And then one last one actually for Steve. When you guys came public, the model was different. And I think Jason got into some of the evolving market dynamics, so I won't go there here. But with more and more of these sales-type leases coming out and some of the pricing pressure that we've seen, how do we think about gross margins going forward? This is something we thought as you were coming public would be a metric that would be certainly (inaudible) and potentially falling a little bit? Or how do we think about that in the future?

Yes. I think we have a couple dynamics that will impact gross margins going forward. But there's puts and takes, and we really don't see much change from that mid-70 guidance perspective. The sales-type leases will continue. It's really a function of our partner growth in the future, something we don't have a lot of control over. But we do have control over the expense aspect. And we're at the point where we will be able to leverage our infrastructure from a service and support perspective. So we feel the ASP decline will be able to be offset by the P&amp;L leverage. So I wouldn't come off that mid-70 guidance

Yes, just like kind of add on is, the sensitivity around this business at this size, a couple percentage shift between NeuroStar treatment sessions and NeuroStar revenue because of the large gross margin difference with it can move the gross margin a couple of points. And you can see in this quarter, our percentage of NeuroStar treatment sessions is slightly lower than it was this time last year, and NeuroStar's are a little bit higher. And when that happens, you just see a shift down. And then you also know that our international sales were up, and it's further compounded when the international sales are up and that's going to be a little bit lumpy and that can move us up 500 basis points as well from quarter-to-quarter. So those are kind of the key drivers there. And then we talked a little bit is -- a little bit about our price as well

Your next question comes from Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities

Just on to the legacy customers, again, I just want to be clear, not any specific geography in the U.S. You said that you don't think there's any competitive impact. And it really, based on your analysis, has to do with how long they've had them. So if they've had them for longer, they're not seeing your reps as often. Is that fair?

Dave, that is fair. And so what we're seeing is that there's a little bit more time to maintain those customers than we anticipated

Got it. And then you mentioned Greenbrook and Success as well. What percent of your business today is covered by groups like that? And I mean do we see this moving forward? I'd love you to just take a guess at where is that going? I mean are there going to be several more of these, do you think that becomes, I don't know, maybe even more significant part of your business, maybe 30%, 40% over time? Any color you can give us there?

Yes. So we haven't really talked about that -- the number specifically, but when you think about -- when we think about fixed-price contracts, you can see how fast that aspect of our business is growing. We haven't provided a specific number of systems or total installed base, but it's a little bit over 10% of our current installed base. And that's the number of systems out there or in this fixed-price contract component

Got it. And I imagine you think that, that continues to build over the next couple of years as the companies grow, right?

Yes. Yes. So think about it, right? Our customer segmentation strategy is focused on really the top 10% of the market that those -- that treats 1/3 of patients. Well, that leaves 90 other -- 90% of market call points that we're not really actively calling on and these small doctors need to refer to somewhere. And this has given rise to this service provider concept where that doctor needs a place that's TMS-only where they can refer to. It's kind of like the orthopedic surgeon doesn't refer to an orthopedic surgeon with an MRI or x-ray. And many of the largest, largest orthopedic centers have that, they refer to radiology group

So in this way, the corollary is really these service providers are creating an opportunity for psychiatrists to TMS-only facility, meaning they just go there to get treated and come back, they don't have an option to get CVT therapy or get written a prescription. And we see this as really a function also of our direct-to-consumer efforts, right, when patients around the country seeing NeuroStar advertised, they're depressed, they'll go into their existing psychiatrist, and we -- you all understand that this market is significantly underpenetrated. And they'll go into these psychiatrists, and they just don't have a TMS, and they're looking to create an option for their patient to get treatment. And moving it to these service providers is really how they create a continuum of care within their practice

That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Thatcher for closing remarks

Thanks for joining us this morning. We look forward to updating you on our next quarterly call

Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements covered under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements related to our business, strategy, financial and revenue guidance and other operational issues and metrics. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business

For a discussion of risks and uncertainties associated with Neuronetics' business, I encourage you to review the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's annual report on Form 10-K expected to be filed later today. The company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the course of this call, except as required by law

During the call, we'll also discuss certain financial information on a non-GAAP basis that includes EBITDA. Management believes that non-GAAP financial information, taken in conjunction with U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides useful information for both management and investors by excluding certain noncash and other expenses that are not indicative of trends in our operating results. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures to compare our performance relative to forecast and strategic plans to benchmark our performance externally against competitors and for certain compensation decisions. Reconciliations between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results are presented in the tables accompanying our press release, which can be viewed on our website

With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Neuronetics' Chief Executive Officer, Chris Thatcher

Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I'll provide an update on our performance during the fourth quarter, followed by an update on a few strategic aspects of the business. I'll then hand the call over to Steve to walk through our financial performance, after which I'll provide an update on the business going forward, including guidance for 2020. Then we'll open up the line to take your questions

Total revenue in the quarter was $17.4 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year primarily driven by 14% growth in U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy revenue and 13% growth in U.S. NeuroStar treatment session revenue. These results were in line with our expectations for the quarter, and we continue to be pleased with the pace at which we've been able to consistently grow our installed base, with the fourth quarter representing the seventh consecutive quarter in which the active installed base has grown approximately 20% over the prior year quarter. Through the continued execution of our commercial strategy, we've been able to consistently penetrate and take advantage of the large untapped market that exists in the U.S

Starting with an update on Business Development Managers or BDM sales force. As noted on previous calls, our goal for the year was to bring our total BDM territories to 59 by the end of 2019, and we met that goal. We also ended 2019 with 33 NeuroStar practice consultants and 15 clinical training consultants, in line with the plan we laid out at the beginning of 2019. The NPCs and CTCs are an important part of the value proposition that we offer to ensure that customers are supported in training and operationalizing NeuroStar in their practices. We continue to evaluate how to best resource our commercial team across BDMs, NPCs and CTCs to ensure the right balance between NeuroStar sales, driving system utilization and providing a high level of training and customer support. As I'll discuss later, we're going to make a modest shift in the focus of our commercial resources towards NPCs and CTCs in 2020

We had another quarter of strong system sales with our TMS-only providers. As a reminder, these are large businesses often having multiple sites across the country who either receive patient referrals from psychiatrists in the community that don't currently offer TMS or market directly to patients struggling with depression or both. We're thrilled at the pace at which we've been able to become the preferred partner to many of the country's largest TMS-only providers, and we will continue to focus on this attractive segment in the market as these providers are likely to drive consistently higher volumes of patients and make multiple new system purchases over time

On our last call, we mentioned a decline in system utilization amongst a subset of our legacy customer base. We did a thorough analysis of these accounts to determine the underlying cause of the slowdown and have worked with our sales and marketing teams to develop our strategy to reverse these trends. We found that there is room for improvement in utilization on a majority of these customers with the right combination of training and support. We did not expect to see a market improvement in the utilization of these systems in the fourth quarter as we're still in the process of working with these practices. However, we believe that we can deliver improved utilization in 2020

Shifting gears to our global expansion efforts. We continue to see solid early commercial traction in Japan following our positive reimbursement decision in June of 2019. We view Japan as a high potential geography and are very pleased with the work that our partner, Teijin, has done so far to develop the market. We expect revenues to be lumpy in the near-term as we work with Teijin to increase awareness, system installations and psychiatrists training with a goal of driving both capital and treatment session revenues

Lastly, I'd like to discuss the future expansion of indications for use for the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system. We're very excited to announce that the company's recently received Breakthrough Device Designation in the U.S. from the FDA for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy treatment for bipolar disorder. Breakthrough Designation provides several potential advantages, including a proactive and faster dialogue with the FDA, the potential for innovative clinical trial design via the program's clinical protocol agreement process and an expedited review process of the company's submissions to the FDA. It also validates the need for an effective nonpharmaceutical treatment option for this disorder. We're working with the FDA to determine the specific clinical study design and expect to have some clarity on this later in the year, at which time, we'll share more details

Overall, we believe that we remain well positioned to continue to drive top line growth in the business and build upon our market leadership position over the long term. Despite some recent lumpiness and utilization among the small percentage of our customers, throughout the year we have continuously demonstrated our ability to drive the adoption and utilization of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy

I'd now like to hand the call over to Steve to discuss our financial performance

Thanks, Chris. Before I provide a review of our fourth quarter financial performance, I would like to bring your attention to a change in the way we are going to report our U.S. revenues. As our business has evolved, as a result of the increased usage of sales-type leases as well as fixed price treatment session contracts, the composition of our U.S. revenue has shifted. In an effort to provide investors with the most useful information on our business, we have changed how we present our U.S. revenue. Under the new reporting structure, U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue will be reported as 3 separate items: NeuroStar capital revenue, the significant majority of system revenue, which consists of revenue from capital sales and revenue from sales-type leases; operating lease revenue, which consists of revenue recognized from units previously rented; and other revenue, primarily revenue generated from the sale of treatment coil upgrades

In addition to providing a breakout of these 3 items within U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue, we will be providing a number of new systems installed in the U.S. during the quarter. This number represents the total number of units sold in the U.S. as either a capital sale or a sales-type lease

Total U.S. treatment session revenue is comprised of all U.S. treatment session revenues from both our per click business as well as our fixed-price contracts. Going forward, we will provide an average revenue per active system metric defined as total U.S. treatment session revenue divided by the U.S. active installed base at the end of the prior quarter. We will be providing a supplemental disclosure document on the IR portion of our website, which includes a quarterly historical breakout of the new U.S. revenue reporting structure for 2018 and 2019

Turning to the quarterly results. Total revenue for the quarter was $17.4 million, an 11% increase over the prior year quarter. U.S. revenue was $17 million, an increase of 13% over the fourth quarter of 2018. International revenue was approximately $325,000, a decrease of approximately $220,000 versus the prior year quarter. The year-over-year decrease was a function of the initial stocking order of systems placed by Teijin during the fourth quarter of 2018 that did not recur this year. U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $5.4 million, an increase of 14% over fourth quarter 2018 revenue of $4.8 million

In the fourth quarter of 2019, NeuroStar capital revenue was $5 million, an increase of 14% over the fourth quarter of 2018. In the quarter, a total of 78 units were sold compared to 65 units in the fourth quarter of 2018. As anticipated, blended average selling prices declined 11% as compared to the prior year due to a higher mix of sales-type leases versus capital sales and lower prices on capital sales. We expect that average selling prices will fluctuate based on the mix of capital sales and sales-type leases as well as underlying pricing trends

During the quarter, we saw our active installed base increase by 21% to 1,085 units, a net increase of 178 units from the fourth quarter of 2018 and a net increase of 53 units sequentially. As a reminder, the active installed base includes capital units sold, sales-type leases and operating lease units. In the fourth quarter of 2019, U.S. operating lease revenue was $176,000, a decrease of 24% as compared to the prior year quarter. Due to the accounting change that went into effect in 2019, we don't currently expect to install any new systems under operating lease agreements. And thus, this revenue number will eventually go to 0. In the fourth quarter of 2019, other U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue was $278,000, an increase of 50% over the prior year quarter as we saw an increase in the number of treatment coil upgrades compared to the prior year quarter

Turning to U.S. treatment session revenues. U.S. treatment session revenue was $11.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. The increase in treatment session revenue was driven by our larger customer base, purchasing more treatment sessions and a larger number of systems installed under fixed-price contracts

During the quarter, average revenue per active system was approximately $10,900, a decrease of 5% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to the substantial number of new systems sold in the last 18 months that have not yet ramped up to steady state utilization and price declines for per click treatment session

U.S. service and other revenue was approximately $376,000, a 12% decline over the prior year. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $13.1 million, an increase of $1.2 million from $11.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2018. We continue to generate very strong gross margins in the fourth quarter of 2019 at 75.7%, down just a bit from the fourth quarter of 2018 gross margin of 76.3%. This small decrease in gross margin resulted from a higher mix of sales-type leases and lower average selling prices on capital system sales

Sales and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $11.5 million, an increase of approximately $825,000 over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the increased size of our sales force. General and administrative expenses were $4.3 million, a decrease of approximately $385,000 compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by the year-over-year timing of public company costs. Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $4.2 million, an increase of approximately $2 million from the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to product development costs related to the continued development of our next-generation platform and higher personnel costs in preparation for clinical trials. Net loss for the fourth quarter was $7.6 million compared to a net loss of $6.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, for the fourth quarter of 2019 was a loss of $6.3 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018

Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $75.7 million compared to $104.6 million at the end of 2018. We are pleased to announce we closed on a $50 million term loan with Solar Capital, which allows us to repay the $30 million currently outstanding on our prior debt facility within the interest-only period and provides for additional capital to bolster our balance sheet at favorable terms. The debt is available in 2 tranches, which would be funded as follows: tranche 1, $35 million, funded yesterday; tranche 2, $15 million, will be available to be funded on or before December 15, 2021, at our request and within 30 days of our achieving a net product revenue milestone measured on a trailing 12-month basis, measured on or before November 30, 2021. The interest-only period on the initial tranche is 24 months but can be extended by an additional 12 months on our achieving a net product revenue milestone measured on a trailing 12-month basis, measured again on or before November 30, 2021

I'll now turn the call back over to Chris. Chris?

Thanks, Steve. As we move into 2020 and beyond, we'll be putting an increased focus on accelerating our pathway to profitability. As a result, we'll be taking some actions with our spending and strategic initiatives this year, focusing on a path to EBITDA positive in late 2022 to early 2023. We also would note that we believe that cash on hand combined with credit available to us is sufficient to get us to EBITDA positive

Starting with the sales force. Over the last couple of years, we've gone through a period of rapid expansion, and we currently believe that BDM territories in the mid-50s is the most appropriate and optimal number of territories that cover the U.S. at this time. Despite the slight decline in the total number of territories versus where we ended 2019, we believe that we can continue to drive growth in new system installations as a number of BDM full-time equivalents or FTEs will actually be higher in 2020 than 2019 due to the cadence of hiring throughout the year. We've also expanded our HVT-targeted universe to the top 5,700 solo and group practices in the U.S. that treat 60% of the MDD patients in these types of practices. This gives the BDMs more accounts to prospect and optimizes the BDMs' productivity at this juncture. In order to keep up with our growing installed base, we will add NPCs and CTCs to drive new system ramp up and facilitate ongoing utilization. Thus, in 2020, we expect to hire 7 NPCs as well as a regional manager, along with 2 additional CTCs

Another area of the business we're adjusting is our international expansion efforts. In the past, we have considered entering a number of incremental geographic regions in Western Europe and Asia. However, given the large greenfield opportunities in both the U.S. and Japan that still exists, we will remain focused on these regions exclusively for the time being

I would now like to discuss our product and clinical development efforts. As noted earlier, we just received Breakthrough Device Designation for bipolar disorder from the FDA, so we decided to concentrate our near-term efforts on this indication. Bipolar disorder by definition is someone that has undergone episode of depression followed by an episode of mania. We're going to focus on the greatest unmet need, which is the episode of depression

We remain interested in pursuing a PTSD indication as well, but think it's prudent from a cash management and profitability perspective to prioritize our clinical development activities first on the bipolar disorder. We are also continuing development of our next-generation NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system with an eye on improved usability, precision and reproducibility

Turning to guidance for the full year 2020. We're setting guidance of total worldwide revenue to between $69 million and $71 million, representing approximately 10% to 13% year-over-year growth, respectively. For the first quarter of 2020, we expect worldwide revenue of between $13.5 million and $14 million, representing 6% and 10% year-over-year growth, respectively. For the full year 2020, we expect to generate strong gross margins to remain in the mid-70% range, and we expect operating expenses to between $76 million and $78 million

We're very excited about the opportunity for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy to help a significant number of patients who suffer from major depressive disorder. We intend to maintain our market share leadership position in the category by offering the most advanced and effective technology and the best customer support to the largest and most sophisticated commercial team in the industry. We plan to leverage this team to continue to expand our installed base at an impressive rate, drive system utilization and provide best-in-class customer support and training. Our commercial strategy remains consistent as we continue to focus on both the TMS-only and HVT providers, and we will continue to invest prudently in marketing programs to drive awareness of our therapy with patients and increased systems use at customers' practices. We look forward to updating you on our progress during the year

With that, I'd like to open up the line for questions

================================================================================
Questions and Answers

(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair

The first one for me maybe is just to start on guidance. So in terms of the 2020 guidance, can you give us a sense of what you're modeling for average treatment revenue per system? And what does that assume for some of the legacy accounts, maybe that you guys are trying to put some new strategies around to reaccelerate?

So when we talk about average revenue per active system, so we see that there's a bit of seasonality and we would expect in Q1 slightly lower average revenue per active system. And then it generally increases across the year to high, typically in the back half. We believe it will be flat to slightly down because of higher installed base with slightly lower ASPs over the full year

Okay. And the impact of those legacy accounts, maybe both for the second half of 2019, so we can get a sense of -- kind of that headwind. And then what that could be over a matter of 2 or 4 quarters whenever you think that you can see some improvement there?

Yes. So we're monitoring that. We've been in and we've assessed those accounts. We understand what's attributing to the decline and the primary operational issues, Margaret, such as staff turnover, training new staff and one-off reimbursement challenges. The sales force has identified what those are. And over a period of time, we're tracking what we think our impact is going to be in those accounts

The thing that's going to drive most of our increased utilization or our average revenue per active system in 2020 is really our ability to scale our most recent customers. That will have the greatest impact on that number, as in all years. So the systems that we put in last year will have the greatest impact on utilization across 2020

Okay. And just one last question for me. In terms of kind of those latter -- that latter focus in terms of the bigger physician accounts and kind of the TMS-only centers. Is there anything that has surprised you over the last few quarters? And what do you think they can do and what can you do for them to continue to help scale going into 2020?

Yes. So the TMS-only accounts -- just to give everyone a sense of where TMS-only fits in, there's about 5 companies out there, maybe several of those emerging. Of the 5 that are out there, we believe that we know we have the primary market share within those accounts. To give you a sense of the TMS-only, TMS-only really provides patient referrals to accounts that don't have a TMS system. So our market focus right now is on 22% of the solo improved practices, which is about 5,700 of the 25,000 accounts that exist, and that's about 60% of the MDD patients in the segment. And really, with the TMS-only providers, our playing is in the 78% of the accounts that we're not targeting that have about 40% of the MDD patients

So this is how we address the entire market. We are the primary partner for TMS-only. And then we have our sales force, our BDM team selling on and selling into the highest potential single and group practices in 2020

And our next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity

This is actually Cecilia on for Jason. And I just wanted to ask about your recent strategy, shifting the focus from growing the BDM force and just your outlook beyond 2020. I know you talked about mid-50s being kind of a target range for now. But beyond 2020, as you expand indications, does this seem like the right size? Or will you continue to evaluate that? And just from an SG&amp;A standpoint in 2020, can you talk about the impact of really growing your force rather than the BDM size sales team?

Okay. So to give you a sense of where we are with the BDM team in 2020. On a weighted average in 2020, we had about in the high 40s of full-time equivalents for BDMs, and we believe, this year, we'll have BDMs in the mid-50s. We also think that with the increase in the number of new accounts per reps, plus, we also are forecasting a slight increase in the number of second system sales. For the last 24 months, we've been getting into larger accounts, and we are seeing higher rates of second system sales. So we believe that with this modest increase year-over-year in BDMs with a slightly higher productivity rate, that we'll have a record 2020 in terms of new system sales for the year

As it relates to beyond 2020, we're going to monitor and manage the business appropriately and we'll guide on 2021 in the future. That said, we are shifting more resources to NPCs and CTCs to bring and improve our average revenue per active system and bring that metric more in line with our unit sales of 20%. So that's the real big thrust for us here. We'll chart the progress of those new NPCs and CTCs on impacting pull-through at the account level. And then at the end of the year, we'll be really thoughtful and assess and then decide what we're going to do in 2021 and beyond

Okay. Great. And then, I guess, just also turning to revenue guidance. Just what are you thinking in terms of capital ASP trends in 2020 as well as installed base growth that's factored into your guidance, especially as we continue to target these high-volume accounts? And just how you're thinking about the mix in these accounts between sales and sales-type leases?

Okay. So the question is, how are we thinking about top line growth. So -- well, we think about it in 2 parts. So as I mentioned, we think the productivity of BDMs will remain constant to slightly up. So we expect a record-breaking year on the capital unit sales in 2020. That said, we expect a slightly lower blended ASP, which is a function of the capital sales and the sales-type leases in 2020. So the combination of those will create a little bit of downward pressure on ASPs for 2020 and we're not going to break out the mix between that. We are giving you the total unit sales each and every quarter

And as I mentioned, we've sold a significant number of systems over the last year. And these systems have not ramped up to a steady state. We know we have a much higher percentage year-over-year in systems that are less than 18 months. So this lowers our overall average revenue per active system each and every quarter. So while we're treating more -- and selling more treatment sessions year-over-year, the U.S. treatment session revenues are not growing in line with the active installed base because of that reason. And we're looking to add NPCs and CTCs to close the gap on that. We also expect slightly -- some slight downward pressure on our per click treatment sessions, ASPs to continue in 2020 as well

And our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Brien with Piper Sandler

This is Drew on for Matt. I just kind of wanted to go back to some of the utilization in the legacy accounts that impacted you last quarter. It sounds like it didn't bounce back by too much in Q4 as you had expected. But I guess the question is, did you see any improvement as the quarter went on in those accounts? And then sort of what gives you confidence that it can improve going forward? And then I guess, lastly, on that, I mean, mainly, can you give us a feel for what level of rep expansion to address this issue specifically has been incorporated into your OpEx guide?

Sure, Drew. So for Q4, we did not expect to see any change in utilization in those accounts. We are basically in there diagnosing and trying to understand what the circumstance is. The good news is that most of this has been attributed to operational issues, as I just explained. And these are well within the bailiwicks of the NPC, CTC and reimbursement team to resolve. Short term, what we did is -- and [ARC's] currently doing is shifting the cull patterns of the NPCs that we have in the company now to spend more time on this group of customers. And as you heard, what we plan to do is, to address this longer term, is we're increasing the number of NPCs to 7 and the number of CTCs to 2 to provide more touches to the existing customers while at the same time, being able to scale our ever-expanding and growing installed base. So overall, that's how we're addressing that customer group

Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the international side, I guess, especially in Japan. I know you're getting -- just getting started there, yet you had a difficult comp in Q4 of '18. But obviously, a pretty large opportunity. And it just kind of seems to be moving a little bit slow. Are you making any additional investments to kind of speed up the process there? And then, I guess, any impact from the coronavirus?

Okay. Great. So last year was a start-up year, right? It's really the building and the beginning of the foundation. We got approved in June. And the purchases last year was really to create inventory for both NeuroStar and new NeuroStar treatment session. This year is really all about the pull-through of that inventory and replacing an inventory and we'd expect to see orders of capital equipment across the entire year. And then we gradually see increasing in NeuroStar treatment session purchases. So this is really going about as planned. We're pretty impressed with their early sales they've gotten in Japan. They've gotten the leading key opinion leaders to purchase at their universities over there. We're getting some really good national publicity over there. So I think we're growing as we expect it to grow in that market. That said, is we're not expecting significant growth in Japan based on what I just said. Most of the inventory that was sold, most of the sales last year was to build inventory. It wasn't the pull-through of inventory. And then this year, we'll see that pull-through of inventory. They have added incremental sales reps to the organization in the back half of last year, and that looks promising as well. And remember, we do not fund any of the SG&amp;A for this operation in Japan. Teijin is responsible for that part of the business planning and investment

And our last question comes from the line of Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities

And just going back to the legacy account, the 100 or so we talked about last quarter. It looked like the attrition was something like 25 in this quarter, fourth quarter. And I was wondering if you could just comment on -- are you culling some of those older accounts and what you expect that -- it's a little higher than, say, what you've averaged in the past. Just maybe color on what you expect in 2020 for that

Right. So it was a little higher in the fourth quarter, and it's typically a little bit higher in the fourth quarter for the last several years. And remember, when an account goes inactive, that means they haven't bought a treatment session for us -- from us in 12 months. So these are usually decisions that happened in the fourth quarter of the prior year. So it seems that there's a little bit or slightly higher business decisions are made about closing a practice, stop providing TMS as a service line and/or moving to a competitive system. Those seem to have happened more often at the end of the fourth quarter. So it's slightly higher this quarter than our prior 3 quarters

We don't anticipate that run rate continue. We believe it will go down to probably somewhere around 1.5% a quarter, somewhere in that range, give or take, a quarter or a half each and every quarter. So we're not proactively culling it. And remember, this is -- most of these are people that are getting out of practice or can't make TMS work. And that's one of the reasons why we have evolved our strategy in the last 24 months to get into higher volume accounts that have more back-office capabilities and greater capacity to operationalize a NeuroStar in their practice. And most, if not many of these, are legacy customers that have decided not to continue with the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy or have gone out of practice

Got it. And then just looking to the guidance, actually, the revenue commentary, the breakout. Just curious to break out operating lease but not the sales-type that's now included in the capital. I guess the logic there, I'm just curious if you would even comment sort of on how sizable that sales-type lease could be in that capital sales and why break out operating if you think that's trending towards 0?

Yes, Dave. We're trying to move away from the financing differentiation of systems sold. So going forward, we're going to report systems sold and the total revenue for those systems and really get away from differentiating between sales-type lease and traditional capital sales. It really is just, really, capital acquisition strategies for our customers. And as a reminder, we only offer sales-type leases to our large TMS-only service providers. Our strategy is to free up their capital so they can continue on with their expansion plans and not have their monies tied up with the system acquisition costs. And so those -- that subsegment will continue to grow and will grow at a higher rate than traditional capital equipment sales in 2020, somewhere north of 30%. And that's why you'll see some fluctuation in the ASPs as that mix changes quarter-to-quarter. But again, we feel it's more important to get installed base growing north of 20% like we've done in the past 7 quarters. And ultimately, the treatment session volumes will catch up

Got it. And I think last quarter, you gave sort of an update on Greenbrook, Success, some of the others. Just curious if you could provide any update on sort of the mix for the TMS-only providers today? I mean I imagine it increased again, but just directionally, I imagine that continues in 2020. But any update on the size of those guys for you today?

Yes. Thanks, Dave. So as it relates to some of these large TMS-only accounts like Greenbrook and Success TMS, we prefer for them to comment on their earnings calls as it relates to their performance in the marketplace. But we're delighted to partner with these groups. We think that our value proposition really resonates with this group. We have significant investments in field service engineering, tech support, and our TrakStar system provides them real-time insights into their locations, utilization of their systems. So we think our value proposition on many fronts really resonates with this group. We're not going to be breaking them out on a go-forward basis. And they'll be part of our overall NeuroStar treatment session revenue and our NeuroStar capital revenue

And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Chris Thatcher for closing remarks

Thanks for joining the call today. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our next quarterly earnings call

Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the first quarter 2020 financial and operating results conference call. (Operator Instructions)
 I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Mark Klausner. Thank you. And please go ahead, sir

Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Neuronetics' First Quarter 2020 Conference Call. A replay of this call will be available on our website for 30 days. Joining me on today's call are Neuronetics' Chief Financial Officer Steve Furlong; and Andy Macan, Senior Vice President and General Counsel. Steve and Andy are also members of the Company's Office of the President

Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements covered under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements related to our business strategy, financial and revenue guidance, the impact of COVID-19, and other operational issues and metrics. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties associated with Neuronetics' business, I encourage you to review the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including the company's annual report on Form 10-K filed on March 3, 2020 and quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which will be filed later today. The company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the course of this call except as required by law

During the call, we'll also discuss certain information on a non-GAAP basis, including EBITDA. Management believes that non-GAAP financial information taken in conjunction with U.S. GAAP financial measures provides useful information for both management and investors by excluding certain noncash and other expenses that are not indicative of trends in our operating results. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures to compare our performance relative to forecast and strategic plans to benchmark our performance externally against competitors and for certain compensation decisions. Reconciliations between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results are presented in tables accompanying our press release, which can be viewed on our website

With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Neuronetics' Chief Financial Officer, Steve Furlong

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I'll provide an update on recent events that have occurred within the company along with an overview of how the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic turmoil are impacting our business. I'll then provide an overview of our first quarter financial results, provide our thoughts on the remainder of the year and then open the call up for your questions

Beginning with the management transition, in early March, the company announced the transition and senior management. The Board of Directors established an interim Office of the President, made up of myself and Andy Macan, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, to lead the business while the company recruits a new CEO

Additionally, Brian Farley, the company's Chairman of the Board was appointed as the Board's liaison to the Office of the President. The Board of Directors has appointed an Executive Search Committee and has engaged a recruiting firm who is performing a formal search for a permanent CEO. In the meantime, we continue to drive the company's tactical and strategic initiatives with the goal of maintaining and expanding our market leading position

Shifting gears, I would like to provide an update on our response to the impact of COVID-19 as well as an update on our business more generally

As previously announced, we have experienced a material impact on our business from COVID-19. As a result, we have taken numerous proactive steps aimed at keeping our employees and customers safe, continuing to support our customers and their patients during the crisis and managing our capital resources with a view towards both near- and long-term business continuity

Depression is a debilitating condition that millions of patients suffer from worldwide and for those undergoing or in need of TMS treatment for depression, we believe that TMS treatment is a medical necessity. The company is not aware of any COVID-19-related government order that prohibits the initiation or continuation of TMS therapy for the treatment of depression. We estimate today that approximately 1/3 of our customers have temporarily suspended treating patients while many others have heavily curtailed TMS patient treatments. We believe adoption of safe and appropriate pandemic operating procedures by our customers is possible, and many customers have already established these operating protocols. To facilitate safe ongoing use of the company's products, the company has provided customers with clear sanitizing and disinfecting procedures for the NeuroStar TMS Therapy system

Clinical associations such as the Clinical TMS Society are similarly providing guidance to practitioners on delivery of this important therapy in a manner that is protective of both patients and practitioners. At this time, it is not clear when practices that have suspended or curtailed in-person patient treatments will begin to restart patient treatments utilizing the pandemic TMS and patient treatment protocols. In the short term, we expect that our capital equipment sales and treatment session revenues will be materially impacted by this pandemic as customers are deferring capital purchase decisions, and new patient treatment starts and system utilization have declined compared to our pre-COVID-19 projections

In the first quarter, total revenue was $11.5 million, down 10% versus the prior-year quarter. During the first 2 months of the year we were on track to hit our previously issued revenue guidance for the quarter. Beginning in mid-March, as the spread of COVID-19 and related stay-at-home orders accelerated in the U.S., we started to see a significant decline in both new system sales and treatment session volumes. Despite our belief that TMS treatment is a medical necessity for the treatment of depression, system sales slowed and various levels of shelter-in-place initiatives to turn patients from seeking treatment and cause some customers to temporarily reduce or cease providing TMS Therapy

As a result of both the recent management transition and the anticipated impact of COVID-19, the company implemented a number of steps to adjust the size of the business with a focus on both near- and long-term business continuity. Even before COVID-19, we were evaluating the company's commercial model with the goal of rightsizing our organization. Prior to the restructuring implemented on April 8th, the company had 213 employees including a 152 in the sales and marketing organization. After the restructuring, which involved layoffs, furloughs and spending decreases, the company has a 117 employees, of which 74 are in the sales and marketing organization. It was a difficult decision to reduce staffing but in doing so, we believe the company is in a far better position to weather a prolonged impact of the pandemic on our business and come out successfully

We also reduced our marketing spend and delayed certain projects to reduce expenses and conserve cash. The full financial effect of these changes will emerge in the third quarter of 2020. We now project operating expenses in the second half of 2020 to range from $25 million to $27 million. This represents a projected reduction of our operating expenses in the second half of 2020 of approximately one-third compared to the first half of the year

It is our belief that the company can maintain industry leading customer service with fewer people and more efficient processes. Given the restructuring and the ongoing economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, our priorities have shifted accordingly. We had previously calibrated our commercial organization using a traditional sales representative productivity model, where the majority of the growth in the business was driven primarily by adding BDM to drive system placements and adding MPCs and CTCs to improve system utilization

With the current revenue pressures along with the shift in our customer base to a higher mix of 'TMS-only providers', who have unique buying preferences and system utilization, we now believe that we can support the future growth of the business with this realigned commercial organization

As it relates to our geographic expansion efforts, we have previously indicated that we will continue to focus exclusively on the opportunity that exists in Japan. That strategy remains unchanged, as we still view Japan as a medium-term growth driver for the business. While our expectations for the revenue contribution from Japan for this year were not initially significant, we have started to see a negative impact from COVID-19, similar to what we are experiencing in the U.S. We will continue to monitor the situation alongside our distribution partner Teijin with our goal of anticipating and appropriately reacting to changing conditions in Japan

Lastly, as to our indication expansion efforts, we are continuing dialog with the FDA regarding appropriate study designs for demonstrating efficacy in treating bipolar disorder and potentially other indications

Before shifting to a financial review, I would like to briefly comment on the limited duration stockholder rights plan that we recently announced. The Board believes that the Company's current trading level does not reflect Neuronetics' inherent value or the potential of our products and strategy execution. Given the share price dislocations created by an extremely turbulent market, the Board of Directors adopted the rights plan to protect all shareholders' best interests. The rights plan is designed to guard against opportunistic tactics to exert control over the company during this period of economic uncertainty and market volatility, protect long-term shareholder value, and ensure that all of our shareholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of the company. For further details regarding the rights plan, please review the current report on Form 8-K filed on April 8, 2020

Now shifting gears to a financial review, total revenue for the first quarter of 2020 was $11.5 million, a 10% decrease compared to first quarter 2019 revenue of $12.7 million. From the beginning of the year until mid-March, we were on track to meet our previously announced guidance of $13.5 million to $14 million. Starting in mid-March, the COVID-19 pandemic, government-mandated social distancing and the resulting economic turmoil caused a significant drop-off in performance across our business. Our system sales were heavily impacted in late March as many customers deferred or delayed purchasing decisions due to the impact of COVID-19. Nevertheless, our sales team was able to successfully sell 38 NeuroStar systems in Q1, 2020, compared to 43 systems in Q1, 2019

Similarly treatment session volumes, both from ongoing treatment and new patient starts, declined substantially beginning in mid-March as shelter-in-place orders and other similar restrictions were put in place throughout the United States. To provide some context on the magnitude of the decline, we are going to share some operating metrics that we typically do not disclose and do not anticipate providing on an ongoing basis

In March, we saw 21% year-over-year decline in per-click treatment session volume even though the COVID-19 disruptions did not substantially impact our business until the second half of March. New patient starts across all of our customers fell by an average of over 55% during the final 2 weeks of March as compared to the average weekly run rate during January and February

The trends that we experienced in late March continued into April. Total revenue for the month was down approximately 45% versus April of last year. Total U.S. capital revenue was most significantly impacted from a year-over-year perspective, down approximately 80% as customers continued to defer or delay purchasing decisions. Within the treatment session portion of the business, we saw continued year-over-year slowdown in April with total treatment session revenue down approximately 33%. The decline was primarily driven by a significant increase in per-click treatment session volumes

The U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue for the first quarter of 2020 was $2.6 million, a decrease of 23% versus first quarter 2019 revenue of $3.3 million. The decrease was primarily driven by fewer NeuroStar system sales as well as lower other revenues related to HP coil revenue in the first quarter of 2020. We expect that average selling prices will fluctuate based on the mix of capital sales and sales-type leases as well as underlying pricing trends

In the first quarter, NeuroStar capital revenue was $2.4 million, a decrease of 18% compared to first quarter 2019 revenue of $2.9 million. During the quarter, we saw our active installed base increase by 20% to 1,119 units, a net increase of 188 units from the first quarter of 2019 and a net increase of 34 units sequentially. As a reminder, the active installed base includes capital units sold, sales-type leases and operating lease units

In the first quarter, US operating lease revenue was $155,000, a decrease of 15% compared to the prior-year quarter. Due to the accounting change that went into effect in 2019, we don't currently expect to install any new systems under operating lease agreements and thus this revenue number will eventually go to 0 as the terms of these operating leases expire

In the first quarter of 2020 other U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue was $29,000, a decrease of approximately 80% over the prior-year quarter as we saw a significant decline in the number of treatment coil upgrades purchased during the quarter

Turning to U.S. treatment session revenue, U.S. treatment session revenue was $8.2 million for the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of 7% over the prior year quarter. The decrease in treatment session revenue was driven by a decline in average revenue per active system, largely caused by a material reduction and per click treatment session volume during March, caused by COVID-19. During the quarter, average revenue per active system was approximately $7,600, a decrease of 22% from the prior year quarter primarily driven by a 16% year-over-year decrease in U.S. treatment session revenues during March, being spread over a much larger active installed base during the first quarter of 2020

Gross margin for the first quarter of 2020 was 75.5% compared to first quarter 2019 gross margin of 77.9%. The decrease was the result of lower blended NeuroStar capital system ASPs as well as lower per-click treatment session volumes during the quarter. Operating expenses during the first quarter of 2020 were $19.1 million, an increase of $2.1 million compared to $17 million in the first quarter of 2019. The increase was primarily driven by sales force, higher product and clinical development expenses, as well as management transition costs

Net loss for the quarter -- for the first quarter of 2020 was $12.6 million or negative $0.68 per share as compared to first quarter 2019 loss of $7.5 million or negative $0.42 per share. EBITDA for the first quarter of 2020 was negative $10.5 million as compared to the first quarter of 2019 EBITDA of negative $6.4 million

Moving to the balance sheet, as noted earlier we have put in a significant amount of effort aimed at ensuring that we have adequate capital resources and liquidity to support the business over both the near and long term. As of March 31, cash and cash equivalents were $63.6 million. On April 27, we disclosed that we had applied for and received a $6.4 million loan from the Paycheck Protection Program. The intent of the PPP is to help small businesses, like Neuronetics, and their employees weather the COVID-19 pandemic and the business-closure mandates enacted through the US. Neuronetics intended to use the PPP loan proceeds for exactly these purposes

Due to questions concerning the eligibility of public companies similarly situated to the Company, the Company will repay its PPP loan on or before May 7, 2020. Frankly, it's a shame. The PPP could have provided an important bridge to companies like ours that have been severely [impact] by COVID-19 and lacked access to other forms of liquidity. The PPP loan would have benefited our employees and partially mitigated the significant disruption that COVID-19 has had on our business

Beyond conserving cash, we are significantly reducing operating expenses. The Company now estimates operating expenses for the full year 2020 to be in the range of $58 million to $60 million, compared to the previously issued guidance of $76 million to $78 million. Based on the restructuring of the business and the realignment of our strategy, we expect operating expenses to be in the range of $12 million to $14 million per quarter. [At] these levels, we now believe that we are likely to achieve operating-income breakeven at revenue of $18 million to $20 million per quarter

Looking into the balance of 2020, given the ongoing disruption caused by COVID-19, we withdrew our full-year 2020 revenue guidance in early April. With substantially all of our revenues generated in the US, our revenue performance during the remainder of the year will be driven in large part by the cadence of reductions and eventual elimination of COVID-19-related stay-at-home orders and social-distancing restrictions throughout the Country

Q2 capital-equipment placements will be highly correlated with new and existing customers' willingness to expand their TMS service capabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic and their abilities to secure financing through third-party lenders. We will continue to drive revenue from treatment sessions where practices are actively treating patients, but we acknowledge that the volume of treatment sessions being purchased is materially lower than we would typically see. Based on these expectations and our April results, we expect our second-quarter revenue to be down materially, both sequentially and year over year

Once restrictions have been eased, we believe there is the potential for a return in demand for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in the back half of the year. There will not only be a backlog of patients who have not been able to access treatment during the quarantine who will seek it, but we believe it is entirely possible to see a spike in new patient starts in response to the intense strain put upon many Americans during this period. Any such increased demand for mental health services should help to keep psychiatric practices and providers in good economic health. Like these customers, we are in a good position to help a potentially growing number of MDD patients as they become suitable for TMS, making our therapy more important than ever

With that, I would like to open up the line for questions

================================================================================
Questions and Answers

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair

Maybe, first, to start out, we can dive into the sales and marketing spend and the changes you guys are making there. So first, can you give us details in terms of how many BDMs do you have as well as on NPC CTCs and whether you're keeping that structure or not?

We are maintaining that structure. I would say the most significant change we have made to the sales organization was integrating those 3 functions vertically. Prior to early March, we had a different management structure. Now we feel going more vertical with BDMs, NPCs and CTCs under the same manager was the more efficient approach and extremely timely, given the environment we're operating in. The specific numbers, I don't think of that relevant at this point, but we do -- we will be maintaining that same type of structure and support to our customers

Okay. Yes. So part of it is the impact of what that means for kind of 2 types of accounts that you guys have, so you referenced focusing primarily on those TMS-only accounts. But on the same token, we've seen a little bit of pressure on the legacy accounts over the last few quarters. So maybe you can give us a sense of how you're strategically changing the focus on that as well as the percentage of sales that those accounts could represent, will be represented?

Sure. Yes, in 2019, we did see a significant shift in sales to the TMS-only service partners and we are forecasting that to continue into 2020 and 2021. These entities are very self-sufficient and don't need the level of support that stand-alone practices or psychiatrists require. So we are able to redirect some of our BDM time to our traditional customer base. From an MPC and CTC perspective, it's pretty much the same type of model. Again, those service providers are again self-sufficient and have great business models and are able to conduct their business without a lot of our support. Obviously, we do offer training and other types of support to those partners. But they are less reliant on the Neuronetics' offerings

Okay. I think the question for me is more focused on the legacy accounts. So those would be the accounts that I assume maybe were closed a little bit more or maybe aren't giving as much TMS treatment during this environment. So between that and maybe less support potentially coming to them, does that mean that that segment can grow or is it going to decline for a bit while you guys refocus back on those TMS-only accounts?

Yes. During our last conference call, Malgorzata, we did indicate that we had a program in place to address those legacy accounts. We highlighted the top 150 and our MPCs have been working with each of those legacy accounts. Again, a lot of these operational issues that led to some of those volume declines were, I would say, easily addressed by our MPC team and hopefully they can get those legacy accounts back to the volumes where they were prior to that drop-off that we saw in Q3 and Q4 of '19

Your next question comes from the line of Marie Thibault from BTIG

Just a follow-up on Margaret's question, I'm curious what you saw in the first 2 months of the quarter when things were a little bit normal in terms of the success of efforts to increase utilization of the legacy accounts. Any color you can give us there?

Not specifically, but again as we communicated on the call, the expectations as late as March 13, where we were going to achieve the guidance that we had previously offered at $13.5 million to $14 million, a lot of the inputs from the field, both from BDMs and MPCs were that at least until that point the impact on from COVID-19 wasn't really material, and then all of a sudden, that last 2.5 weeks of March volume declines were extremely material. I will say that the program that we put in place was still relatively early in Q1. So it would be difficult to forecast those results but we did have a well-formalized program to again get those volumes back to where we saw them in the early part of 2019

Okay, sure. And then with a couple of states or some states opening last week, are you seeing any customers in those geographies? I guess any early color you can tell us about centers reopening or treatment session volumes? And interested by the idea of an uptick and more patients coming out of this quarantine and needing the mental health help, are you positioning for any new marketing efforts around that with your customers? Anything you can tell us about that would be helpful

So regarding the states that are starting to ease the restrictions, yes, our customers that are seeing those easings are starting to restart the business. Speaking with our TMS-only providers, they really haven't skipped a beat, they've really been pushing to maintain their treatment session volumes. I think the one area being hardest hit still is the Chicago area that's slowing a little bit of progress there. But all in all, I think you're seeing a general slow reopening of those centers, the 33% that had ceased treatment. One of the key indicators that we look at -- so we track sales, utilization, but also the MT or motor-threshold starts; and we did see a nice uptick towards the end of April that would indicate to us that it's not a 100% correlated, but it is correlated to the new patient starts, which you would think would lead to a bit of a recovery as we head into May and June. So we are seeing some signs that we are gradually starting that uptick

And then anything on marketing for new patients?

Yes. So we have started some, I would say more strategic focused marketing efforts. Again, we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, again trying to preserve cash and being unsure of the length and the magnitude of COVID-19, but we did see in April the incidence of depression scripts spiked up significantly and 75% of those scripts were for new patients. So following the treatment protocol of TMS being indicated for one failed drug, you can envision a potential increase in TMS treatments towards the latter half of 2020

Your next question comes from Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler

I guess just to start with your various customers out there, you've got the TMS-only providers, the chains, you've got the independent providers as well. Can you just talk about their ability to ramp back up from a capital perspective to get back going? I know in the past you've had some--one of your chain providers actually gave your systems back, is that a potential headwind we could see if some people decide that they just can't make a go of it in this environment that we could see over the next several quarters? So just how the things go out here from a patient treatment perspective as been to Q3 and then capital perspective, is it more expecting very little capital sales Q2, Q3, maybe a little bit more in Q4? Just that general ecosystem, how do we think about things progressing there?

Yes, I think our existing customers will be in the best position to restart since they already have the capital in place. Again, depending upon the duration of some of the social distancing and stay-at-home orders some of the lower-volume customers could be impacted more than others. I think one of the fallouts of this pandemic could be some consolidation depending upon the customers' both economic and just overall willingness to continue with TMS. I just think it's too early to tell

We do have a number of third-party financing partners that are still willing to lend to our customers. And so at least from that financing perspective, that hasn't dried up at this point and I know our sales team is still out there, pushing for transactions and selling as many NeuroStars as they can. So I do think the environment will likely change. Again, it really depends on how long this last and what the economic impact is to our customers. But I was going to say the TMS-only partners, they probably are and the larger facilities are in the best shape to come out of this even stronger

Okay. So I know you're in cash preservation mode, but you're much better capitalized than many of your other competitors in this space. And so I'm curious, you've got flexible financing plans available for customers. So is there an opportunity with some maybe wounded competitors to get some of that share away from them in this environment, maybe near term and maybe that being a little bit of a backstop for our system placements goal?

I mean that possibility exists. And so Matt, making these difficult decisions and reducing our workforce, it certainly wasn't easy. But Andy and I, as soon as we saw some of the indicators in mid-March really start to decline, knowing that 2 of our more valuable assets were our commercial team and our strong balance sheet, we really wanted to make sure that we were in a great position to come out of this whenever the end of the pandemic comes. And so yes, part of that strategy, could be maybe being a bit more aggressive on the sales side, using that strong balance sheet to our advantage when it comes to sales and understanding that customers are making their purchasing decisions, not only on our best-in-class technology but also on the longevity of the company, and who is likely to survive and thrive once this is all behind us. So yes, that is certainly a possibility

Okay. And then just one more from me if you don't mind, just the reductions across the organization, we're a little bit steeper than I was expecting, again I know you guys are trying to preserve cash, the smart move but again, a little steeper than I expected. So as we come out of this, what kind of grower is Neuronetics? And how do you support your customers? Because a big part of the store really is your customer support and everything else like that; so what happens to the organization from here and what kind of grower do you look like?

I really think part of that will be dictated by the level of economic recovery. Similar to a lot of industries, there's just a lot of unknown as to what the fallout will be. But the one thing we did do was in -- and share our financial ability to weather this storm and I agree we were, I would say, extremely aggressive with what we did in late March and early April. And it really was to preserve the company. You know, assuming things got back to normal or close to what normal was pre COVID, I think the company again with would be growing along the lines of what we previously communicated. And again with the increase in depression prescriptions during March and April, it is reasonable to think that some of that increase will eventually head towards TMS Therapy

Your next question comes from Cecilia Furlong from Canaccord Genuity

I just wanted to ask again just about your sales force specifically from a territory perspective and from a BDM perspective, kind of what you're seeing now after the reductions, but then more so longer term, what you see as kind of coverage-at-scale level, especially given your new kind of focus within just HVT?

So the territory realignment is still a work in process at this point. We still view the territory alignment based on opportunities, density, the amount of coverage that BDM can appropriately cover as well as a bit of productivity in the back of our minds. We do think that once those territories are fully aligned that the BDMs will have the opportunity to both make money and also service the accounts that they're assigned

So at this time and again -- with the increase in TMS-only providers, some of that opportunity within those territories really is deflected to those partners. And so again, we think with the vertical management integration and that support structure our BDMs will be able to be more efficient and also more productive, and we do reserve the right or ability to add back resources as the economic environment unfolds

This really was, I would say, a very aggressive action to secure our balance sheet, but we will not jeopardize the service offerings that we have in place for our customers. And so if we see strains or pressures within the commercial organizations, we do reserve the right to add those resources to assist our customers

Great. And if I could also ask just within the reduced spending this year, just how you're thinking about R&amp;D, specifically the NextGen system and your pipeline initiatives -- bipolar being the primary one -- but just how kind of these reductions may play out on timelines in that perspective

Yes. From an R&amp;D perspective, the projects that we had in place at the beginning of the year are still in place. I will say we did slow some of the spending in R&amp;D. Again and late March in April, it's the duration and the severity of COVID that we didn't fully understand. So we didn't think it was prudent to go out and kind of execute on our original plan that was in place what we had our original 2020 plan in place. But that's still exists and is an ongoing project

Regarding the other indications, again, we've communicated in the past and we continue with discussions with the FDA. Obviously the pandemic has redirected some of the FDA resources. Honestly, they have a lot more on their plate with COVID-19 than worrying about how we're going to structure our clinical trial with bipolar, but those discussions do continue, and we are hopeful and optimistic that we can come up with a collaborative resolution and see where that heads in the future

This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Furlong for any closing remarks

Thank you all for joining the call today. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our next quarterly earnings call. Please stay healthy and have a great day. Thank you

Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect. Speakers please hold.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the second quarter 2020 financial and operating results conference call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Mark Klausner. Thank you, and please go ahead, sir

Good morning and thank you for joining us for Neuronetics' Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. A replay of this call will be available on our website for 30 days

Joining me on today's call are Neuronetics President and Chief Executive Officer, Keith Sullivan; and Chief Financial Officer, Steve Furlong

Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements covered under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements related to our business strategy, financial and revenue guidance, the impact of COVID-19 and other operational issues and metrics. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties associated with Neuronetics business, I encourage you to review the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's annual report on Form 10-K filed on March 3, 2020, and quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which will be filed later today. The company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the course of the call, except as required by law

During the call, we'll also discuss certain information on a non-GAAP basis, including EBITDA.

Reconciliations between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results are presented in tables accompanying our press release, which can be viewed on our website

With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Neuronetics' Chief Financial Officer, Steve Furlong

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call is Neuronetics' newly appointed President and Chief Executive Officer, Keith Sullivan. After Keith provides an introduction, I will shift to a high-level overview of our second quarter performance and recent trends in the business, after which I will review our second quarter results and then provide our thoughts on the balance of the year. I will then turn the call back over to Keith for his thoughts on near-term initiatives before opening the line for questions

With that, I would like to hand the call over to Keith. Keith?

Thanks, Steve, and thanks, everyone, for joining us for our call today. I want to begin by saying how excited I am to be joining Neuronetics. I'm incredibly enthusiastic about the long-term opportunity that exists for the company to improve the quality of life for patients suffering from psychiatric disorders

Let me give you a brief overview of my background. I've been in the medical device space for almost 3 decades. Before joining Neuronetics, I spent over 5 years at ZELTIQ in leadership roles within the commercial organization, ending my tenure as President and Chief Commercial Officer at the time that Allergan acquired the company in 2017. Prior to ZELTIQ, I have held leadership roles at a variety of pharmaceutical and medical device companies, including Medicis Pharmaceuticals, Reliant Technologies, Medtronic and Coherent Medical

Before the Neuronetics opportunity arose, I had independently spent a fair amount of time examining the TMS industry as a whole as well as Neuronetics specifically. In fact, I was a consultant to the company on 2 occasions prior to and immediately after the commercial launch of NeuroStar. While a professor at the Mason School of Business at William &amp; Mary, I wrote and taught a case study on the TMS-only provider business with a focus on Greenbrook TMS, Neuronetics' largest customer

In addition, I have known Bruce Shook for years. As you're aware, Bruce recently rejoined Neuronetics as a Board member after having cofounded and led the company for a number of years as CEO

I'd like to share with you what made me excited about the opportunity and why I think the company has such a bright future. First, we are the unquestioned market leader in a rapidly growing in-demand therapeutic sector. We have more systems installed and have treated and helped more patients than all other TMS providers combined. Second, we have a tremendous technology supported by the highest quality clinical data in the industry. Because of this, our systems are proven, reliable and clinically robust. Third, we have a well-established commercial infrastructure that has been reorganized over the last few months and now has the potential to drive meaningful growth. Our focus is to drive greater awareness of the benefits of NeuroStar amongst patients as well as provide meaningful support to our psychiatry providers. And lastly, we have a great team here at Neuronetics, and I'm impressed with their knowledge, motivation and dedication to our mission. Having said that, I believe that there are areas of the business that can be optimized to best take advantage of the opportunity that exists

Only a few weeks on the job, I am currently in the process of digging into every aspect of the business as well as talking to customers and patients to make sure that I fully understand the current needs of the market. Using those insights, we will put them into the -- place the optimal strategy to drive the highest quality therapy to the greatest number of people. While it is too early to provide a detailed outline of our long-term strategy, what I know at this point is that with the tremendous foundation that exists today, we can take this business to the next level and drive long-term success, allowing us to help more patients suffering from psychiatric disorders

With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Steve to provide an update for the second quarter. Steve?

Thanks, Keith

Total revenue for the second quarter was $9.7 million, down 41% over the prior year, primarily as a result of COVID-19, which persisted throughout the quarter, causing an impact to both our capital equipment sales and the utilization of systems in the field. Given the challenges presented by COVID, we are pleased with the performance of the business during the period

On the capital equipment side, after an April in which new system sales were effectively shut down, we saw a strong sequential uptick in May and June. Another key metric of performance is per-click treatment session volumes. While these volumes continue to slow down in May, we have seen a reversal of that trend in June, and we now believe that May will represent the low point for treatment session volumes for the year

At the end of the quarter, we estimate that approximately 80% of our customers were back up and running, up from 70% that we noted on May's call. Based on the 80% of customers who are on our cloud-based TrakStar management tool, we have seen an approximate 70% increase in average daily treatment session volume from the low point in early May through the end of June. We have seen similar trends and new patient starts as defined by patients doing a motor threshold test. After hitting a trough in early May, new patient starts at the end of June are approaching the volumes we were seeing in January and February

Capital purchases have begun to come back but at a slower rate than the rebound in system utilization. For much of the second quarter, our BDMs were frozen out of the market due to travel and social distancing restrictions. Where these restrictions have started to ease, BDMs have begun to get back out into the field to prospect accounts. We do anticipate that capital sales will continue to rebound, albeit at a slower rate

I would like to provide an update on some key topics related to the business. As a result of the current environment, we are seeing an increased focus on mental health throughout the United States, which recent prescription data has reinforced. In an April Express Scripts report, data showed that the use of prescription drugs to treat mental health conditions increased by more than 20% between mid-February and mid-March, with prescriptions for antidepressants increasing by 18%. Importantly, when looking at prescriptions filled during the week of March 15, 78% were new prescriptions. This indicates a significant increase in patients suffering from depression who are seeking care. While this is a point in time estimate during a notably stressful period in American history, we continue to believe that there will be a significant uptick in depression patients, many of whom will ultimately fail pharmaceutical treatment and will be seeking an alternative therapy

As we announced in April, we restructured our commercial organization as part of our corporate reorganization. This included a substantial reduction in headcount within our sales team. At the end of the quarter, that team consists of approximately 45 employees spread between the 3 key roles: business development managers or BDMs, who are focused on capital sales; NeuroStar practice consultants or NPCs, who are focused on operationalizing and driving the utilization of systems within practices; and clinical training consultants or CTCs, who are focused on training psychiatrists and staff on proper usage of systems once installed. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately 16 BDMs, 17 NPCs and 7 CTCs. While we added back a few NPCs and CTCs in July to service the improving system utilization, we may selectively increase the size of the team in the future. We believe the size and structure of the sales force will allow us to generate top line growth by focusing on driving increased system utilization and by more effectively deploying our BDMs

On our last call, we noted that with psychiatrist offices closed and patients being held under social distancing restrictions, we reduced spending on certain marketing initiatives to conserve cash. We did, however, continue to actively invest in areas that we think will benefit the company, our customers and patients over the long run. Initiatives like the call center pilot, virtual training and digital marketing. Our call center pilot connects patients who visit our website to a live call center operator who can then schedule an appointment directly with the psychiatrists in their area. The early indications from this pilot are exceeding our expectations, and we are in the process of planning for a broader launch later in 2020

In response to the COVID pandemic and a need to continue to support NeuroStar practices staying open to treat TMS patients, we offered a series of webinars in the second quarter. Over 900 individuals registered for these webinars on topics ranging from peace of mind for patients that provided videos on how to prepare the office and treat patients with TMS during COVID to TMS coverage and reimbursement update that outlines several recent positive changes in coverage

On the digital marketing front, we continue to leverage this cost-effective method to educate patients and psychiatrists on the benefits of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy

We have also seen notable progress in our reimbursement landscape recently. Our FDA current indication is adult patients who have failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from one prior antidepressant medication. However, many payers have taken a more conservative approach in terms of the number of failed drugs before they will reimburse for NeuroStar Therapy. As a company, we have been working with payers to change that and make NeuroStar Advanced Therapy more readily available for patients seeking to manage their depression

During the quarter, we had several notable wins, including Cigna, which represents 16 million covered lives. We were able to reduce pharmacotherapy criteria from 4 failed drugs to 2 failed drugs or intolerance to 1 medical trial. Aetna, which represents 22 million covered lives, we were able to extend coverage to include patients between 18 and 21 years old where it previously had been exclusively for 21 years old and over, added a provision for retreatment approval based on 50% improvement and reduced pharmacotherapy criteria from 4 failed drugs to 2 failed drugs. And finally, HCSC/Blue Cross/Blue Shield, which represents 15 million covered lives, we were able to reduce pharmacotherapy criteria from 4 failed drugs to 2 failed drugs. We view this as a meaningful progress towards making it easier for patients to get access to NeuroStar Advanced Therapy and should lead to an increase in new patient start volumes over the longer term. We will continue to work to make this shift more broadly adopted among all payers

Shifting gears to our financial performance. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was $9.7 million, a 41% decrease compared to the second quarter 2019 revenue of $16.6 million. This was primarily a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, related governmental responses and resulting economic turmoil

U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was $2.3 million, a decrease of 49% versus second quarter 2019 revenue of $4.6 million. The decrease was primarily driven by a lower number of NeuroStar systems sold in the quarter, lower blended NeuroStar capital system ASPs due to a higher mix of sales type leases during the quarter as well as lower other revenue related to fewer HP Coil upgrades sold. In the quarter, the company sold 35 systems, down from 61 systems in the second quarter of 2019 as a result of the impact of COVID-19

During the quarter, we saw our installed base increased by 13% to 1,122 systems, a net increase of 146 systems from the second quarter of 2019 and a net increase of 3 systems since March 31, 2020

Turning to U.S. treatment session revenue. U.S. treatment session revenue was $6.5 million for the second quarter of 2020, a decrease of 40% over the prior year. Average revenue per system was $5,850 during the second quarter of 2020 compared to $11,651 in the prior year quarter. Both of these declines were driven by COVID-19-related practice shutdowns

Gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 was 76.2% compared to second quarter 2019 gross margin of 74.8%. The increase was primarily a result of a change in the product mix of revenues versus the prior year

Operating expenses during the second quarter of 2020 were $14.3 million, a decrease of $4.7 million compared to $19 million in the second quarter of 2019. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to reduced sales and marketing expenses, including trade shows and advertising, travel expense and personnel costs. On a sequential basis, operating expenses decreased $4.7 million from $19 million during the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the implementation of our cost saving initiatives

Net loss for the second quarter of 2020 was $7.8 million or $0.41 per share as compared to second quarter 2019 net loss of $7.1 million or $0.39 per share

EBITDA for the second quarter of 2020 was negative $6.2 million as compared to the second quarter of 2019 EBITDA of negative $5.9 million

Moving to the balance sheet. As noted earlier, we have put in a significant amount of effort aimed at ensuring that we have adequate capital resources and liquidity to support the business over both the near and long term

As of June 30, cash and cash equivalents were $54 million. We remain focused on conserving capital, and earlier this year, instituted a number of cost reduction initiatives. We expect to realize the full impact of these cost reductions in the third and fourth quarters. The company continues to project total operating expenses for the full year 2020 to be in the range of $58 million to $60 million. Going forward, we continue to expect quarterly operating expenses to be in the range of $12 million to $14 million. And at those levels, we believe that we are likely to achieve operating income breakeven that revenues between $18 million and $20 million per quarter

Moving on to our outlook for the balance of the year. We believe that April and May will be the worst-performing months of the year, causing the second quarter to be the worst-performing quarter of the year. Looking forward, we expect to see modest sequential recovery in both the third and fourth quarters

I would now like to hand the call back over to Keith. Keith?

Thanks, Steve

Before opening the lines for questioning, I'd like to outline the areas of the business that we will be focused on in the near term. First is to drive awareness of TMS as a very safe, effective therapy for depression. We plan to conduct market research to identify the proper target audience, the messaging that resonates with them and the most efficient way to communicate with them. We currently have a significant number of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy systems in the field, and we will be focused on working with our customers to make all of these systems successful

The second area of focus is our commercial organization. The leadership team has adjusted the field sales team to drive treatment session volume and revenue per system. Once the market data is collected, we can create the proper tools to arm our NPCs with what they need to help our accounts with educating depression sufferers on the benefits of TMS to help convert them to patients. This is a process that will take some time to deploy, but we are confident that we can be a valuable partner with our accounts to make them successful and help their patients

In my prior experience in the aesthetics space, it was not too long ago we would walk into a practice where the physicians had little to no experience generating patient demand and were not actively driving new patient volume. We were able to drastically change that through coaching and demand generation. We believe that the same can be done with the psychiatric community. With the power of social and digital marketing as a tool for both driving awareness and generating demand, we can partner with these practices to build a thriving business, treating patients and supporting their growth. When we achieve this growth, it will be a catalyst to drive additional system sales

Lastly, we are accelerating our indication expansion efforts in an effective and efficient manner. We have long believed that the NeuroStar platform can and should have a much broader applicability within the treatment of psychiatric disorders. As such, we will be evaluating our go-forward strategy to make sure that we can progress through the regulatory process more efficiently and bring new indications to the market sooner

I'm very excited about what the future holds for Neuronetics. Throughout the pandemic, we have put into place a highly proactive strategic set of initiatives that put us in a position of strength that will set us up for success as the world continues to reopen. Building on that foundation, we believe that by executing our marketing plan, coupled with our proven technological advantages, robust clinical evidence and future additional indications, we will continue to expand our leadership position in the field of TMS and have a greater number of patients achieve relief from debilitating mental illness over the near, medium and long-term

With that, I would like to open the line for questions

================================================================================
Questions and Answers

(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair

A few for me. Just to start, COVID -- the COVID updates you guys gave are pretty meaningful. Sounds like maybe the new patient starts are nearly back to normal. So first, can we say that it's fair to call new starts between 90% and 100% of pre-COVID levels? And then second, how long does it take for those new patient starts at this rate to get treatment revenue back to that pre-COVID level?

So thanks for the question, Margaret. And yes, it is safe to say that the current new patient starts are at pre-COVID levels. And so we are anticipating those favorable trends to continue throughout Q3 and Q4, assuming we don't get hit with a second stage. Obviously, once the new patient starts -- traditionally, 97% of those patients will continue through the approximately 36 treatment sessions for the therapy. And so again, we are forecasting that, I would say, modest sequential growth to continue throughout 2020

Okay. And that sounds a little conservative to us, especially on the back of what the reimbursement decisions that you did talk about this quarter. Can you give us any background on those? How long were you working on them? And how do you compare these relative to some of the prior reimbursement decisions that you guys have had?

Yes. So we have an employee dedicated on working with our providers to ensure that the reimbursement does get to the levels that were indicated, which is one failed drug treatment. So these are really ongoing efforts and not something that was more definitive in terms of a time line. And I expressed this during our last call. I mean this is critically important really for the patients. If the payers are requiring 4 failed drugs for reimbursement, it could take a patient between 12 and 24 months of failed drugs, which accompany multiple side effects potentially before they're able to get to TMS therapy. And so we view the 4 failed drugs to 2 as being a huge step for these 3 payers

Again, ultimately, it would be great if we could get consistent reimbursement coverage for the indication of one failed drug, but those efforts do continue on a daily basis, and we are extremely pleased with those decisions in the second quarter

Okay. Yes. And then last one, if I could. Keith, you've been around a while. We've known you for a while at ZELTIQ. How would you compare maybe your initial thought processes going into ZELTIQ versus Neuronetics? And as you think about where you're going to spend your time over the next 12 months, is it customer focused? Is it reimbursement decisions? And what would you define as a success a year from now?

Well, good to hear your voice, Margaret. It's been a while. I think that -- as I mentioned in my remarks, I think there's an opportunity to build greater awareness within the patient community on TMS. And I think that to date, the company has done a good job, but I think we need to update the market research to find out who is our target audience today and then how to get to them. So I think we are doing the call center. We're doing digital and social marketing. But I think over the next 12 months, we'll be able to refine that and be able to do a better job at targeting those patients and building the awareness

Secondly is also helping the accounts themselves, be able to bring those patients in and then convert them. So it's similar to the opportunity that was at ZELTIQ. There's always a little nuances with each business, but I think that there is a chance -- a strong chance -- that we can take some of the learnings from that and apply them here

Your next question is from Matt O'Brien with Piper Sandler

This is Drew on for Matt. I wanted to push just a little bit on the COVID trend for some of your downstream customers. Obviously, good to hear on the new patient side. I understand that patient throughput may be a little bit more challenging as there are a lot of numerous requirements for bringing the patient back in office. But I guess just stepping back a little bit, what brings the 20% of [signaries] that you mentioned that are closed back online? I mean is that primarily related to regional outbreaks of COVID? Is there any concern that some of them could be permanent closures or something else?

Yes. What we're seeing, Drew, is it's really geographically focused at this point. So there are still significant hotspots throughout the country, and a lot of those states are actually where we have a lot of NeuroStar systems. So we don't anticipate a lot of permanent shutdowns, but some of these centers are obviously still impacted by local and governmental restrictions. So it may take them longer to restart

Again, if you look at Illinois and Chicago, that one in particular has been slower than most to restart and regain the traction. But ultimately, as we work through the pandemic, we do believe that the majority of customers that are presently shut down will come back online

Okay. That's helpful. And then I just was wondering if you could kind of speak to some of your priorities to COVID here. You've made some adjustments on the expense side. It sounds like you (inaudible) capital environment would be just a little bit more challenging for a little while here. Are your customers receptive to the operating lease type model in this kind of environment still? And then, I guess, are there any plans to push a little more aggressively on the treatment session side with some of your existing customers to help offset any weakness you might see in capital?

Sure. I mean we don't offer operating lease financing. What we have is what we term sales type leases, which prior to 2019 could be considered operating leases. But we only offer them to a handful of customers. It's really just targeted towards the TMS-only service providers. Again, our strategy with that subgroup of customers is to make sure they preserve their capital so they can continue to expand as opposed to tying up hundreds of thousands of dollars in NeuroStar capital equipment sales, which could slow their expansion efforts. So it's a very strategic partnership with our largest customers

Secondly, regarding ASPs on treatment sessions, no. The -- we don't see discounting being necessary. The reimbursement for our treatment sessions -- and again, this varies by payer and also geography so it's certainly not the same amount of reimbursement throughout the country, but it is a very favorable economic picture for psychiatrists and other customers

Again, even if you assume an average of $200 reimbursement per treatment sessions, the payback on our machines is about a patient in a year or 7 patients a year. So it is -- they are pretty quick to pay these machines off

Your next question is from the line of Cecilia Furlong with Canaccord Genuity

Great. I guess I just wanted to start off with what you saw in Q2 in terms of rebound but really focusing on the TMS-only centers and just their ability to rebound on a relative basis versus some of your smaller customers

Sure. I mean, obviously, the Greenbrooks of the world and Success TMS, they're are extremely large entities and better equipped to weather the COVID-19 pandemic. Obviously, they were impacted as we all were, but the TMS-only service providers have certainly recovered quicker than some of the smaller facilities. And that's really due to their scale and expertise and changing the way they treat patients. And for example, people don't wait -- or patients don't wait in waiting rooms anymore. It's a very continuous flow through the facilities. So you don't have people in the same room potentially spreading diseases. And so they were able to optimize their workflow and really get ahead of the recovery efforts

Great. And I guess if I could also ask just on your high-level thoughts on OpEx beyond 2020. Early R&amp;D, your focus there specifically and the relative priority in the pursuit of PTSD and bipolar depression indications. I know you commented briefly in your prepared remarks, but just any further color you could give around -- your thoughts around priority of those 2 objectives

Yes. So in April, when we saw the precipitous decline in treatment session utilization as well as new patient starts, we took the swift and decisive action to reduce our expenses. We did communicate that that was for cash preservation, and we would not restart investments until we were comfortable that we were out of the COVID environment. The recent trends certainly indicate we're heading in a favorable direction, and even the July data was pretty impressive. But we really don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves in terms of 2021. So this is something that Keith, I and the rest of the senior team are looking at, again, planning for a restart, but again, not getting too, too far ahead of ourselves

We've had ongoing conversations with the FDA that have been very positive. But until we get comfortable with their position and opinions on clinical trial structure and things like that, we're not prepared to really launch something that lengthy and that expensive

Regarding our next-gen platform, again, that was slowed, but it's still on the radar. And these are the decisions that we'll work through during our planning process, which starts next month

Our next question is from the line of Marie Thibault with BTIG

Welcome, Keith. Nice to have you here

Thank you

I want to ask a question on the capital sales this quarter. They were actually a bit better than we had feared. And so I wanted to get a little bit more granularity on those system sales, the types of centers those were going into and if there's any additional detail you could give us along those lines

Yes. Again, given the environment of Q2, we were pretty impressed with the ability of our BDMs to transact that many systems. You would also expect to see, I think, a more focus on the TMS-only centers. When we looked at the data, the percentage of TMS-only versus, I would say, traditional facilities didn't vary from previous quarters. And so it was just our traditional mix between regular psychiatrists and those TMS-only centers

We do think that there could be an increased focus on TMS-only as we get into Q3 just based on their ability to recover quicker than some of the other facilities, but we'll have to see how that plays out in the quarter

Okay. Great. And I guess I wanted to dig a little bit on your commentary about a lot of systems and some of those hotspot states. Do you have kind of a general breakout of how many or what proportion of systems fit in the South and West, some of those states that are being hardest hit right now?

So we actually -- we do have the ability to monitor everything on a state-by-state basis, and we actually do look at utilization trends every day. And so yes. Naturally, our highest density states are Illinois, Chicago, Texas, California, and essentially, many of the states that are getting hit hard again. But again, our customers have figured out the optimal way to safely treat patients and also keep their staff safe. And so we haven't seen a significant impact even in those states. They've certainly recovered at a very impressive rate since the low point in May. And again, those trends have continued into the month of July

That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Keith Sullivan for closing remarks

Thank you. Thank you, operator. Thanks again for joining us today. While it's early in my tenure, I'm very impressed with the team we have and our ability to move quickly and adapt. For the balance of the year, we will be heads down focused on executing in a dynamic environment, while at the same time, looking to the future and putting a long-term strategy in place. I look forward to updating you on our progress on our next quarterly call. Thank you for joining

Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the third quarter 2020 financial and operating results conference call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Mark Klausner. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Neuronetics' Third Quarter 2020 Conference Call. A replay of this call will be available on our website for 30 days. Joining me on today's call are Neuronetics' President and Chief Executive Officer, Keith Sullivan; and Chief Financial Officer, Steve Furlong

Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements covered under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements related to our business, strategy, financial and revenue guidance, the impact of COVID-19 and other operational issues and metrics. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties associated with Neuronetics' business, I encourage you to review the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's annual report on Form 10-K filed on March 3, 2020, and quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which will be filed later today. The company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the course of this call, except as required by law

During the call, we'll also discuss certain information on a non-GAAP basis, including EBITDA. Management believes that non-GAAP financial information taken in conjunction with U.S. GAAP financial measures provide useful information for both management and investors by excluding certain noncash and other expenses that are not indicative of trends in our operating results. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures to compare our performance relative to forecast and strategic plans to benchmark our performance externally against competitors and for certain compensation decisions. Reconciliations between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results are presented in tables accompanying our press release, which can be viewed on our website

With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Neuronetics' President and Chief Executive Officer, Keith Sullivan

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I will provide an overview of the third quarter performance and then discuss the progress we made on our near-term focus areas. Steve will then give our third quarter results, and I will conclude with our thoughts on the balance of 2020 before turning to questions and answers

Starting with the review of the third quarter. Total revenue was $12.4 million, up 28% sequentially over the second quarter of 2020, driven by growth in both system sales and treatment session revenue. Although there was year-over-year decline in revenue due to the ongoing impact of COVID, which continued to affect both capital equipment sales and utilization in the field, we are pleased with our performance as we have begun to see a meaningful recovery in the business

On the capital equipment side, U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenue grew by 11% over the second quarter of 2020. With restrictions being eased in the third quarter and our virtual marketing and training efforts starting to pay off, our BDMs began to successfully get back into the field to prospect accounts. We are particularly encouraged with the mix of systems sold between TMS-only providers and the traditional psychiatrist office is similar to our historical levels, indicating an increasingly favorable capital sales environment. We anticipate that capital sales will continue to rebound, albeit at a slower rate than we are experiencing with the treatment sessions

Total U.S. treatment session revenue was up 39% sequentially over the second quarter of 2020 and was down just 11% over the third quarter of 2019. We are encouraged by this performance, knowing that approximately 10% of our customers' offices are still not seeing patients in person, but the 90% that are open and starting to see utilization approach pre-COVID levels

Turning to our operational update. On our last call, I laid out our near-term focus areas. As a reminder, they are: first, driving awareness of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy as a safe, effective nondrug therapy for depression; second, putting a focus on driving treatment session revenue by optimizing our commercial organization; and third, developing our indication expansion strategy

As it relates to driving awareness of those psychiatrists who currently utilize NeuroStar Advanced Therapy, the results and feedback are overwhelmingly positive. We are learning during our assessment of the market that awareness of transcranial magnetic stimulation generally and NeuroStar Advanced Therapy specifically for the treatment of MDD is very low, both on the patient and psychiatrist side. This points to a significant opportunity to raise awareness of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. There are over 26,000 psychiatrist practices in the United States and just 800 have a NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System in their office. The market remains underserved and we will continue to work to penetrate it

Shifting to optimizing our commercial organization. In October, we announced Sara Grubbs as our Vice President of Sales. In my 30 years of managing sales teams, I rank Sara as one of the top sales strategists and tacticians I've had the pleasure to work with. She has developed extensive expertise commercializing medical devices similar to the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy that involve an ongoing sale of consumables and world-class customer support. In particular, while at Zeltiq, she spent time developing and implementing the strategy on both capital and consumable portions of the business before stepping up to run the company's sales strategy for one of the largest U.S. regions. We are excited to have her onboard and believe she is the right person to lead the reformulation of our sales strategy to drive treatment session revenue

We are focused on expanding our base of clinical evidence and developing our indication expansion strategy. In addition to bolstering our commercial leadership, we added other talent aimed at leveraging the huge amount of data available to us, including in the large repository of treatment data within our TrakStar cloud management tool. With over 80% of our treatment sessions captured on the cloud, we have a significant amount of data that is being analyzed to help inform and support our strategy around patient marketing, payer reimbursement and regulatory pathways

In October, clinical data was published in the Journal of Affective Disorders, suggesting that NeuroStar Advanced Therapy could be evaluated as a first-line treatment for MDD. The authors analyzed 2 sample sets from our TrakStar registry, which included more than 5,000 patients across 103 practices, evaluating clinical outcomes data for the treatment with NeuroStar. The author stated that research further validates the efficacy results shown in a prior naturalistic study, which showed a 58% response rate and a 37% remission rate. These results are especially intriguing, considering similar metrics for antidepressant drugs, which, on a whole, have a response rate of 47% and a remission rate of 27% according to the STAR*D data for patients undergoing their first drug therapy

The data continues to demonstrate that NeuroStar Advanced Therapy is a safe and effective treatment for those with depression who have not benefited from antidepressant medications. And importantly, provide physicians with the scientific evidence needed to optimize the treatment of patients with depression. According to the lead author of the study, Dr. Harold Sackeim, the NeuroStar's strong efficacy and the low side effects and medical risk profile suggests that TMS be evaluated as a first-line treatment for MDD. Given that approximately half of the payers who reimburse for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy still require patients to fail 4 courses of drugs before being approved for treatment, the continued collection and publication of data showing the benefits of our therapy is critical

During this year's Clinical TMS Society event, in September, Dr. Scott Aaronson presented a webinar on his pilot study on the treatment of bipolar depression, utilizing NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. His presentation reviewed data from a 2-center open-label prospective trial. He concluded that bipolar depression is most likely an excellent target for the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. With so few treatments available for the management of bipolar depression, making NeuroStar Advanced Therapy a nondrug treatment option, could be groundbreaking

Overall, we are pleased with our performance during the third quarter. We saw a strong sequential recovery in the business, both in terms of system sales and treatment session volumes. We also have generated some significant momentum internally with the bolstering of our leadership team and the continued development of our industry-leading clinical data. I'm very proud of how the entire organization has adapted to the uncertainty of COVID as well as a change in management. I continue to be energized by the enthusiasm I am seeing out of the team every day

With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve

Thank you, Keith. Total revenue for the quarter was $12.4 million, up 28% on a sequential basis over the second quarter of 2020. Compared to the prior year, third quarter revenue was down 22%, primarily as a result of COVID-19, related governmental responses and resulting economic turmoil, which persisted throughout the quarter. U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenue was $2.5 million, up 9% on a sequential basis over the second quarter of 2020. Compared to the prior year, third quarter U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenue was down 45%, primarily driven by a lower number of NeuroStar systems sold during the quarter

In the quarter, the company sold 39 systems, down from 68 in the third quarter of 2019 as a result of the impact of COVID-19. During the quarter, we saw our installed base increase by 11% over the prior year quarter to 1,143 systems, a net increase of 111 systems from the third quarter of 2019 and a net increase of 21 systems since June 30, 2020

U.S. treatment session revenue was $9.1 million, up 39% on a sequential basis over the second quarter of 2020. Compared to the prior year, U.S. treatment session revenue was only down 11%. The average revenue per system was approximately $8,100 during the third quarter of 2020 compared to approximately $10,500 in the prior year quarter. Both of these declines were driven by psychiatrists temporarily shifting to telemedicine

Gross margin for the third quarter of 2020 was 78.7% compared to the third quarter 2019 gross margin of 73.8%. This significant increase was due to a higher mix of treatment session revenue as well as a reduction in field service costs during the quarter

Operating expenses during the quarter were $12.2 million, a decrease of $5.9 million or 33% compared to the third quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to reduced sales and marketing expenses as well as reduced research and development costs. On a sequential basis, operating expenses decreased $2.1 million from the second quarter of 2020 as a result of the full realization of our cost-saving initiatives implemented in April

Net loss for the third quarter of 2020 was $3.4 million or $0.18 per share as compared to a net loss of $6.9 million or $0.37 per share during the third quarter of 2019. EBITDA for the third quarter of 2020 was negative $2.2 million as compared to negative $5.6 million for the third quarter of 2019

Moving to the balance sheet. Throughout much of this year, we focused on having adequate capital resources and liquidity to support the business over both the near and long term. As of September 30, cash and cash equivalents were $50.7 million. We continue to believe that cash on hand provides us the capital necessary to get to breakeven

Now turning to guidance. For the fourth quarter of 2020, we expect revenue in the range of $13 million to $13.5 million as we continue to expect to see sequential improvement in the business during the quarter. The company continues to project total 2020 operating expenses for the full year to be in the range of $59 million to $61 million

I would now like to turn the call back over to Keith

Thanks, Steve. Moving to our thoughts on the balance of 2020 as well as 2021. Since joining the company in July, we have made a lot of progress throughout the organization. There is still heavy lifting to be done around the development and implementation of our commercial strategy, but we have put the right people and process in place to drive the strategy forward

As mentioned on our last call, we have engaged a market research firm to identify the proper target audience, the messaging that resonates with them and the most efficient way to communicate with them. Ultimately, our goal is to arm our NPCs with the tools and business development strategies to help customers drive increased patient volume and educate patients on the benefit of the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy as a safe, effective, nondrug therapy for the treatment of MDD. We will have results of the study in late Q4 and look forward to providing an update on the results on our fourth quarter call

In addition to developing the new communication strategy, we are currently in the process of optimizing our sales organization. We will be making decisions around the structure of our sales force, which relates specifically to the ratio of BDMs to NPCs as well as decisions around the expansion of the sales force more broadly. Specifically, we are planning to redefine our BDM territories to better optimize the volume of potential customers' accounts each BDM can cover. We will also align the NPC territories to allow them to have more meaningful impact in driving patient volumes into existing customers. These decisions will be completed shortly, and we expect to selectively hire new BDMs and NPCs during the fourth quarter with the goal of having those new reps onboard and trained ahead of our national sales kickoff meeting during the fourth week of January 2021

Outside of our commercial organization, we have momentum building in other areas, such as reimbursement, clinical data development and indication expansion, which we believe will act as tailwinds for the business in the coming quarters. From that perspective, while we continue to expect solid execution in the fourth quarter and during the first half of 2021, we believe that we will start to see more material positive inflections towards the back half of 2021. We would look forward to providing more robust overview of our strategy for 2021 on our fourth quarter call

I'd like to take a moment and acknowledge the tremendous mental strain that this ongoing pandemic has caused across the U.S. There has been a significant disruption within almost every facet of our lives. In an article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, or JAMA, in October, it was stated that in a June 2020 survey of over 5,400 adults, it was found that 40.9% of the respondents reported at least 1 adverse mental or behavioral health condition, which included depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress and substance abuse. These reported rates were 3 to 4x higher than last year. The need for treatment options to help those suffering from psychiatric disorders has never been greater, and we will continue to work diligently to ensure that as many patients as possible can get relief with NeuroStar Advanced Therapy

With the quarter under my belt at the organization, I am very excited about the future of Neuronetics. We are in a very unique position. We are the market leader in an industry that is largely underpenetrated. We have a large and growing set of clinical data pointing to the efficacy of the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy, and we have a highly experienced team throughout the organization with a proven track record

On top of all that, in early learnings from our market research, we have found that few psychiatrists or patients are aware of transcranial magnetic stimulation or NeuroStar Advanced Therapy as a treatment option for depression. Taken all together, we have a massive opportunity in front of us to bring relief to a significant population of patients who are struggling with drug-resistant depression and potentially other psychiatric disorders

With that, I'd like to open the line for questions

================================================================================
Questions and Answers

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler

I guess, Keith, can we start with the realignment plans on the BDM and NPC side of things? You've seen these in the past. I'm assuming that you're getting a look under the hood now and that's the conclusion that you've drawn probably in collaboration with Sara. But seeing these historically, typically, isn't just 6-month period to really refine the sales force and change territories, et cetera, before you really see a meaningful improvement. It's typically more like a year or more than that. So I guess what gives you the confidence you're going to really start to see the improvement in the second half of next year? And then how do you really make sure that your larger TMS provider customers are comfortable with how things are being adjusted?

Thanks, Matt. I think the analysis that we did of the sales organization is that we have a pretty good team in place. And that when we are restructuring the sales organization, we're really redefining what the BDM territories would look like. We're balancing them so that they will each have a specific number of psychiatrists involved in them

So right now, we -- because of the realignment earlier in the year, there are much -- there are some territories that are very large and some that are very small. So on the BDM side, we balance them. On the NPC side, again, I think we have a talented group that's out there. And what we're trying to do is make them more effective in the field by also balancing them to have about between 30 and 35 accounts each

So we are going to provide training throughout January and at our sales meeting on how we can best utilize the data from our market research. But we're not overhauling the sales organization, we're just trying to make them more efficient

Okay. All right. That's really helpful. And then, I mean, just to put a little bit finer point. On the said guidance that you're providing for Q4 is a little bit below the street, certainly not the end of the world. But as we think about the first half of next year, should we still think about a contracting business for the first couple of quarters and then hopefully getting back to -- even to growth next year, assuming that we don't have another big outbreak of COVID?

Yes. Matt, this is Steve. No, we're still budgeting and planning for a rebound in 2021. I know the expectations are to get back to either at or above 2019 levels and that is something we're certainly not shying away from. Obviously, there's still some economic and pandemic dependencies. But no, with the revamped commercial structure along with the revised strategy, we're looking at growth to return in 2021

Got it. And just one more for me. I know this is probably a little bit further out question. But Keith, your commentary about the first-line therapy is obviously extremely interesting and compelling. I mean, what steps need to happen to get to that point? And then I know this is a difficult question to answer, but can you just frame up a potential time frame for when something like this could, even just a few insurance providers, be the first-line of therapy rather than drug?

Matt, that's a question that we talk about almost daily here. I think we are digging into our TrakStar data where we have 72,000 patients. And in our registry, which is a subset of that, we have over 5,000 patients. So we are looking at that data to be able to help put the information into a formula that can be used by the societies to take to the payers. And I have no idea what the time frame on that is. I think we should have a handle on our data in the next several months. But how long the payers take to react to it? I don't know

Your next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair

This is Brandon on for Margaret. If I could just follow-up on that last question first. As we look to a rebound in the business and you get to 2021 and creating more of a sustainable kind of growth rate, do you think you need to have some of these market access wins in order to hit your internal goals? Or can just some reconfiguring and refining of the commercial organization be enough to kind of make a more sustainable growth profile?

So what I will tell you is in the research that we have backed so far is our opportunity just in treating MDD is large, and the number of physicians that are not using NeuroStar Advanced Therapy at this point is also large. So I think we have a large amount of runway to go without any other indications. But I think we have an opportunity to advance the ball on a couple of different fronts. We all know that it's going to take time with the FDA and then with the payers, but I think we're starting to move forward on those fronts

Got it. And then as we look towards kind of on the system utilization side and the system revenue side -- or sorry, rather the treatment revenue side. Steve, you had mentioned it needs a little over $10,000 per active system as the year-over-year comp. As we go moving forward into '21, should we think about the system base or the installed base able to reach kind of a $10,000 plus number? And then as we kind of look at a sustainable 2021 plus, is $10,000 kind of a floor? Can we look for upside there or is that kind of a level where we level out?

Yes. Brandon, our expectations are to continue to increase utilization throughout the period near term. You saw about a year ago, we felt the initial utilization declines and had plans in place to address it, and then COVID hit and really limited our ability to go out and work with the customers who saw those declines. We fully expect to reengage those customers as well as others with our NPCs and co-marketing programs and other awareness tools to drive well beyond that $10,000 average revenue per system

Got it. And just one last one for me. I appreciate there's probably some noise going on in the Japan business given COVID. But any updates there, even just anecdotal feedback? How the commercialization is going there? And any updates on the potential reimbursement update?

Thanks, Brandon. So in Japan, we do have reimbursement today and there are a couple of things happening. Our distributor is selling systems at a controlled placement model. He is making sure that all of the training is done properly, and he is beginning to conduct our post-market study in the 20 hospitals that we have agreed to do. So there's activity in Japan. It is on a controlled pace

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Plovanic with Canaccord

Just first, if we could talk about the systems. As you roll them out, how does COVID impact your new account strategy as it relates to the chains versus the independent operators? We've heard some of the larger chains are holding back on some of their capital spend and I don't know if this has adjusted your strategy as well

Good to hear your voice, Bill. We've been in touch with our service providers and their business is growing at this point. So I think our individual psychiatrists and our service providers have put the policies and procedures in place to be able to handle the COVID situation. And so they have their patients wait in the waiting room -- in the car before they bring them in, there's no waiting in the waiting room. So I think that's under control. So I think I had a meeting with Greenbrook's senior leadership team and they are placing systems now. So..

Okay. So -- but you talked about it a little bit just in your opening remarks regarding kind of the balance of shifting back to the individual operators versus the chains. Is this and then -- but should we expect that there's going to be more focus or more drive into the individual going forward, just to balance it out a little more? Or will it move one way or another, I guess, is what I'm trying to figure out?

Well, I think our business today is about 50-50, and we're providing the same level of help and assistance and awareness to individual psychiatrists as well as the service providers. So I don't think we're trying to shift it in one direction or the other, I think it's in our benefit and theirs to increase treatment sessions to individuals and the providers

Okay. And then in terms of the treatment sessions. Obviously, you've come back to about $8,100 per system per quarter. And I'm trying to understand if -- to get back to that $10,000, I think you said about 10% of them aren't treating patients. Was there any difference as you went through July and September, October? Are you seeing more and more come on? Because I'm just trying to figure out the cadence of this. And when would you expect to back to 100% of your customers operating?

Yes. That's a good question, Bill. And we just finished up and received October's data, which was extremely impressive and exceeded our own internal expectations. We did see, I would say, a healthy number of sites that had embraced telemedicine restart their TMS platforms in the month of October. And again, we're hopeful that, that momentum can continue through the end of the year. But it was a really strong month

So it kind of sounds that some of the guidance provided might just be conservatism, given the -- given what's going on with the third wave of the COVID. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it's just that's kind of the takeaway I'm getting. Is that a fair assessment?

I think that's fair, yes

Okay. And then just last question for me is, on the operating expenses, you've really done an amazing job cutting back the costs and making the cash you have last a long time. And I think that's something that people may have been concerned about and I can see that you've done a great job there. But as we look at Q3, any onetime charges and any of the operating lines that we should think about that might go away in Q4? Or alternatively, given COVID, not as much T&amp;E going on, maybe not as much marketing support that you have had to provide, what have you, where are the lever points in that off-line from both the plus and the minus we should think about as you drive into the end of the year and next year? And that's all my questions

Yes. Q3, from an expense perspective, was very normal. So no significant out of the ordinary entries. Going forward -- again, so we cut very deeply in April and May and now are, I would say, very strategically adding resources. I don't think you'll ever see us back to where we were from an operating expense perspective anytime soon

And so from a marketing side, a lot of the expenses are being reallocated to different programs. So not necessarily incremental spend. In Q4, I think we'll see some incremental spend as we roll out our programs and new campaigns in 2021. And then from a sales perspective, again, the increases to the team, I would term, is modest. And we're not going to go back to the days of 59 BDMs in 2021. There'll be a handful on both teams

So I think what you saw in Q3, there'll be an uptick in Q4, which is reflective in the guidance. And that will continue into 2021 as we drive growth. We're certainly not going to be in a position to spend ahead of revenue. So we want to make sure that the efforts we put in place in 2020 were valued and we won't get ahead of ourselves

Your next question comes from the line of Marie Thibault with BTIG

Maybe I could start with one there on the discussion of adding back modestly to the teams with some new BDM and NPC hires. What's the ideal profile for these positions? Is it different than you've typically hired in the past? And then, I guess, a related question with all these -- a few realignments happening. Keith, could you tell us a little bit about what morale feels like right now at Neuronetics?

Okay. So on the BDM side, we're going to be looking for people that have capital equipment experience, preferably capital equipment that also has a trailing revenue piece

On the NPC side, it's a relationship builder that's able to go into the accounts, gain the trust and be able to walk in and help them through their marketing efforts, train them on how to work with their front desk staff, their consultation of patients and teach them how to do digital and social media and get their practice up and running. So I think the morale in the organization, both inside and outside, is high. I think we have a plan. We have given it to our teams on a very high level. And I think over the next couple of months as we roll it out, I think there'll be a higher level of excitement

That's great to hear. I want to ask a follow-up on the capital equipment side, along the lines of what Bill was asking about. It does sound like some buying have come back from the psychiatric practices. Could you characterize who is buying or who is doing well enough, I guess, at this point to think about equipment sales? And then of the remaining 10% of customers that have stayed close, are they waiting for a vaccine? Or is there some other time line that you consider for them coming back online?

Marie, this is Steve. So with respect to the 10%. And so we did survey our NPCs who contacted the subset of customers directly. And the vaccine was one of the overarching themes. Again, they want to be very responsible for their staff and patients and have really moved away from bringing patients in-house. And so that will continue to be a pressure as we exit Q4 until folks are comfortable with a vaccine if it does come in 2021

In terms of whose purchasing systems. Again, we mentioned in the call that there's not a lot of difference between the number of systems sold to the TMS-only providers and the traditional psychiatrists. We do analyze this data and just to see if we can see any trends. But it's -- the sales in Q3 were really along historical lines. And then even in the month of October where we did a fair amount of system sales, again, those ratios were pretty consistent to what we've seen in the past couple of years

It's not easy for an individual psychiatrist to make the capital equipment purchasing decision in this environment. There's a significant amount of trust and validation that they must go through to acquire a system in this environment. So we continue to support them and the TMS-only providers as well

That concludes the question-and-answer session for today. I will now turn the call over back to Mr. Keith Sullivan for closing remarks

Thank you, operator, and thanks again for joining us on the call today. I look forward to updating you on our progress in the next quarterly call. And I hope you're safe. Thank you

Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Kaleido Biosciences Conference Call and Webcast. (Operator Instructions) I would also like to remind you that this call is being recorded for replay

I would now like to turn the conference over to Amy Reilly, Kaleido Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead

Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kaleido's conference call and webcast. Two press releases from this morning and a short presentation relating to this call are available in the Investors and Media section of our website

With me for today's call are Mike Bonney, Executive Chair of Kaleido; Alison Lawton, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dr. Kate Knobil, Chief Medical Officer and Head of R&amp;D; and Bill Duke, Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions

Before we begin, let me remind you that on today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements covered under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and are described more fully in our filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website

In addition, all forward-looking statements represent our views only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date

As you may be aware, Kaleido does not typically hold conference calls concurrent with quarterly financial results. However, given the number of topics to review today and their timing with quarter end, we decided this is the most appropriate forum for discussion. Going forward, we intend to host calls and webcast as appropriate based on news flow and clinical data

I will now turn the call over to Kaleido's Executive Chair, Mike Bonney

Thank you, Amy, and good morning to everyone. First, our thoughts are with those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we are grateful to all the health care workers and those that support them for their selfless efforts to support patients during this challenging time. It is important to note that the safety of patients, health care professionals and our employees remains our top priority during these trying times

On the call this morning, Alison and Kate, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Medical Officer and Head of R&amp;D, respectively, will discuss one of the most exciting and compelling opportunities I've had the privilege to be part of in my nearly 40 years in the biopharmaceutical industry: the initiation of the COVID-19 clinical program utilizing our product candidate, KB109

The aim of the clinical program is to determine if this MMT, KB109, can alter the course of the disease in a newly diagnosed mild to moderate cohort of patients infected

(technical difficulty)
 KB109, specifically, are well suited to this endeavor. Product platform and KB 109 specifically, are well suited for this endeavor. We are thrilled to be part of a worldwide effort to better understand and moderate the course of this dev data in the fourth quarter of this year, heralds a broader move to explore the impact of various MMTs on diseases involving immune and inflammatory pathways

Another product candidate from our library, KB295, will be studied in a clinical trial of ulcerative colitis. We expect data from that clinical trial in mid-2021

This new set of strategic priorities adds to our work in UCD and hepatic encephalopathy with KB195 and KB174, respectively. Now over to Alison for more details on the rationale and study design for these exciting new clinical trials. Alison?;;

Thanks, Mike. COVID-19 is
 (technical difficulty)
 unprecedented global impact on health and health care facilities. We continue to adapt our work to help prioritize the safety of employees, patients and clinical staff, and we understand the need for study sites to limit certain activities in light of the ongoing pandemic. We are fortunate with our product platform and efficient discovery and development that Kaleido has both the opportunity and flexibility in responding to these developments. And in fact, we're uniquely positioned to advance the number of pipeline programs, for which we expect to deliver data over the next 18 months

The burden of COVID-19 pandemic is vast, and there remains an opportunity for interventional studies in patients with mild to moderate disease, a population which represents the majority of those infected. There is also a need for a convenient, orally administered, well-tolerated product that has the potential to augment the patient's own immune system to fight the immune-mediated pathology of this disease and avoid more serious complications of the infection and the need for hospitalization

We are initiating 2 non-IND controlled clinical studies of our MMT, KB109, that is designed to evaluate the effects of supportive self-care plus KB109 compared to supportive self-care alone in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 infection who are not hospitalized. The program includes both a multicenter study of approximately 350 patients and a second study of approximately 50 patients, which will also evaluate the composition and metabolites of patients' microbiome

In both studies, patients will be randomized to either receive supportive self-care, the control group, or supportive self-care plus KB109 for 2 weeks, and then will be followed for 3 weeks. These studies will include assessments of clinical outcomes, health care utilization and biomarkers of the inflammatory response that may also help inform the potential of KB109 in other viral respiratory and bacterial infection. We look forward to initial top line results from the multicenter study in Q4 of this year

KB109 highlights the flexibility of our MMT platform. MMTs like KB109 are designed to drive the function and distribution of the microbiomes' existing microbes in order to decrease or increase the production of metabolites and to advantage or disadvantage certain bacteria in the microbiome community. MMT candidates that targeted synthetic glycans that are orally administered have limited systemic exposure and are selectively metabolized by enzymes in the microbiota. These characteristics of MMTs enable an efficient clinical development path, which allows us to move candidates rapidly from discovery into clinical studies under regulation supporting research with food

Strong scientific rationale and data generated to date with KB109, paired with the flexibility of this path, has enabled us to move quickly into an area of high unmet medical need

I will now turn the call over to Kate Knobil, our Chief Medical Officer and Head of R&amp;D, for additional details on the COVID-19 clinical studies and the scientific rationale behind this new program

Thanks, Alison. We are delighted to be collaborating with the University of Massachusetts Medical School and Center for Microbiome Research on our COVID-19 program, along with a number of other clinical centers in the United States. As you've just heard, the 2 studies will enroll approximately 400 outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, who will be randomized to either supportive self-care or supportive self-care plus KB109 orally for 2 weeks, followed by 3 weeks of follow-up

In addition to assessing safety and tolerability, patients will monitor objective measures, such as temperature and oxygen levels and participate in telemedicine visits with clinicians. We will also be collecting data on clinical outcomes, health care utilization and biomarkers of the inflammatory response that may help inform the potential of KB109 in other respiratory viral infections and, more broadly, on the impact of MMTs on the immune system. The study of approximately 50 patients has a similar study design but will also evaluate changes in the composition and the metabolic output of the patient's gut microbiomes

The data and scientific rationale for evaluating KB109 and COVID-19 are compelling. This infection has been associated with activation of an inappropriate inflammatory cascade, which in some patients can cause an abnormally aggressive immune response that can lead to pneumonia and respiratory failure. Increased short-chain fatty acids, which are created by fermentation of glycans by the gut microbiome, have been shown in preclinical models to influence immune pathways and mitigate immune pathology associated with severe respiratory viral infections, including reducing mortality from lethal influenza virus infection. These studies have also demonstrated that short chain fatty acid producing taxa induce virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell and antibody responses involved in the reduction of the severity of viral infection, as well as influencing macrophage functionality to mitigate neutrophil-mediated tissue damage

There are also human data to support the role of short-chain fatty acids in reducing the impact of viral infections. In patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplants who have contracted respiratory viral infection, including coronavirus, the presence of short-chain fatty acid producing taxa has been associated with the significantly reduced risk of progression to lower respiratory tract infections, which can have significant morbidity in this patient population

MMTs are novel glycans that are synthesized to enable precise modulation of the taxonomic composition of the gut microbiome, as well as its metabolic output. Specifically, MMTs promote a beneficial short-chain fatty acid profile in the gut and promote the growth of taxa that has the potential to support the host's ability to mount an appropriate immune and inflammatory response, while also preventing an overaggressive hyperinflammatory state, up to and including cytokine storm

KB109 was selected for evaluation in the COVID-19 clinical program based on its demonstrated ability ex vivo to increase the production of short-chain fatty acids, as well as to promote commensals while reducing pathogenic bacteria. We're looking forward to the initial top line data from this important program in the fourth quarter of this year

Alison, back over to you

Thanks, Kate. With the progress we've had in KB109 resources on the COVID-19 program, Kaleido has elected to pose the Vitora clinical study of KB109 in patients colonized with multidrug-resistant pathogens. We are evaluating next steps for our pathogen program, including a future potential clinical study in a patient population at high risk of infection, such as in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant

Beyond KB109, we are expanding our efforts with our immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases to further understand the potential application of our MMT platform. We plan to initiate a clinical study evaluating a new MMT candidate, KB295, in approximately 30 patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis or UC. UC is linked to microbiome dysbiosis and microbiome restoration has been shown to lead to clinical remission in patients. Short-chain fatty acids are consistently observed as down-regulated in UC patients. Clinical studies administering inulin-glycans have demonstrated an improvement in active UC associated with an increase in short-chain fatty acids

KB295 has shown an ability to increase production of short-chain fatty acids while also reducing the presence of inflammatory bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae also linked to UC. Patients in this single-site study will be evaluated over 56 days of treatment and 14 days of follow-up. We will be looking at safety and tolerability as well as impacts on the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index. Exploratory endpoints include changes in microbiome taxa, short-chain fatty acids levels in stool and serological biomarkers of inflammation. We've been working closely with the European sites of this study and incorporating remote monitoring into the design. And along with the recent IRB approval for the protocol, we are confident we will have top line results in the middle of 2021

Turning now to KB195, which is currently being evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial called UNLOCKED, in patients with urea cycle disorders who are inadequately controlled on standard of care. Given the limitations on patient visits and the impact of COVID-19 on new patient enrollment, we now anticipate the data from this study will most likely be available in the second half of 2021. More than 20 sites are currently activated in 8 countries, and we have submitted an amendment to expand the eligibility age criteria for enrollment of patients aged 12 instead of previously 18 and up to the age of 70 instead of previously 65

With respect to our KB174 program in hepatic encephalopathy, we are ready to initiate the next clinical study in patients with the disease. However, the study initiation is dependent on partnering the program and the resolution of COVID-19 impact at trial sites

In addition to our clinical programs, we have a number of preclinical programs where we expect to have clinical-ready lead MMTs identified in 2021. This will position us well for either potential partnerships or to begin new clinical program

With our immuno-oncology program, our goal is to identify MMT candidate that stimulate the targeted therapeutic response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced preclinical models. We are collaborating with Gustave Roussy, a leading center for oncology immunotherapy in Europe, and we anticipate the selection of lead compounds based on data from our preclinical work in Q4 of this year

We also plan to have preclinical data from validated models of additional immune-mediated diseases that will identify new clinical-ready lead MMT candidates in the first half of 2021. And we continue preclinical work for our cardio-metabolic and liver disease program are on track for results from validated models in Q4 of 2020

Before we take questions, I want to mention that we ended the first quarter with $53.8 million cash on hand, and we continue to manage our operating expenses in line with our pipeline priorities. And as a result, we've extended our cash runway further into the first quarter of 2021. The next 18 months are very important for Kaleido as we continue to translate the promise of the microbiome into solutions for patients. We look forward to key upcoming data milestones, including clinical results from our larger COVID-19 study in Q4; results from our KB295 study in UC in mid-2021; and our Phase II clinical results from our KB195 study in UCD in the second half of next year

Now I'd like the operator to open up the call for your questions

Questions and Answers

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of John Newman with Canaccord

It's very interesting. I wondered if you could talk to us a little bit more about what you've learned regarding the inflammatory pathways associated with COVID. And how your asset 195 -- excuse me, 109 can be effective there?

Yes. John, it's Alison. So great question. I think Kate covered it a little bit in her comments, but I'll ask her to comment some more. Just to summarize, there is a number of pieces of evidence in preclinical models showing the link between the microbiome and short-chain fatty acid production. And also, just to remind you, the short-chain fatty acid production is a result of fermentation of glycans in the gut and the link between this and different immune pathways in infections associated with viral respiratory infections

So Kate, maybe you want to talk a little bit more about the evidence that we have, and then we can comment on KB109 characteristics

Yes. Thanks, Alison. And thanks for your question. We alluded to a lot of the data that we've been looking at recently, looking at the influence of short-chain fatty acids and short-chain fatty acids producing taxa in the gut in preclinical models and also in humans. So just to reiterate, in preclinical models, we've seen that short-chain fatty acids or the taxa that produce them have had a positive impact on the pathology that occurred after influenza virus or RSV in preclinical models and actually has reduced the mortality associated with lethal influenza virus infection in mouse models

It's -- we've also seen that high-fiber diet in these mouse models have reduced the pathology and the subsequent inflammatory reaction in the mice as well, as I mentioned earlier, the function of CD4 and CD8-positive T cell cells in macrophage function. The inappropriate activation of these pathways can also cause increased neutrophil activity that can cause tissue damage, which has also been mitigated by short-chain fatty acids

In humans, the data are really interesting in that in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplants who have been infected with these respiratory viruses, there's been a decrease in the progression of those infections to lower respiratory tract infections. And I think that's really important because in these really vulnerable patient populations, we want to mitigate the activity and the [quality] of this inappropriate immune reaction that we've seen with COVID, and potentially improve the outcomes of these patients and decrease hospitalization

So there's -- we find these data really compelling for the program. And we're looking forward to seeing the results of the studies

And John, just to add one more comment. Just to remind you that KB109 is -- we've shown in our ex vivo screen that it increases the production of the ratio of short-chain fatty acids, as well as, of course, driving down the presence of pathogenic bacteria. And so for that reason, we're very excited to have the opportunity to conduct this study, and look at how KB109 can really help the patient's whole own immune system to prevent the pathological implications with the COVID-19 infection

Okay. Great. And then just had a question on the Phase II study for KB195. Obviously, the entire industry has been affected by COVID-19 in terms of running clinical programs that's been difficult for everyone. Just curious, with the 195 program, wondering when you might be able to activate some of the sites that you have set up, and just kind of curious as to how that might move forward

Yes, it's a great question, John. And obviously, all clinical sites have been impacted by COVID-19. And I think that the safety of patients is obviously the priority as far as not bringing patients into hospital and clinical sites where they could be at risk of acquiring the COVID-19 infection. So as you can imagine, the enrollment of patients in our study has suffered as a result of that. So we're working closely with the sites to make sure that as they start opening up, we can start to enroll the patients again. I want to remind you that we actually have approval now across 10 different countries, and we have more than 20 sites where we're enrolling, and patients that will work closely with, as they say, as they start to get back on to some level of normality. So right now, we are anticipating approximately a 6 months or more delay in the enrollment of that study. But we'll be monitoring that closely as the sites get up and started again

Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs

I was just wondering on KB109, if the current 2 trials could support a potential approval for the treatment of COVID or if additional trials would be required and then maybe you could outline the magnitude of the benefit across the various end points that you're hoping to show in terms of thinking about next steps and what you'd -- what would be an ideal profile for the drug? And then any insight on total cost of the program?

Okay. So I hear 3 questions in there, Terence, one on the potential approval. So let me start there. And what I would say is we are ready for a number of different possible routes forward, depending, really, on the clinical results that we see. We do plan to have a pre-IND meeting with the FDA while these trials are ongoing, so that we have different options depending on the results. I would say that could be anything, for example, from expanding the current clinical studies if we see some signals, but we decide we want to add more patients. It could be working through and ensuring that an IND is filed ready to initiate the Phase III clinical study. What I would also say is, given the safety profile of KB109, if we see signs that -- any signs that look like there's a benefit in these patients, it's a very important patient population to target and avoid these people from meeting to be hospitalized. So we would be ready to work with the FDA at that point and with the potential of opening up an emergency use authorization. So any one of those routes could be a possibility depending on the results that we see

I'm going to hand over to Kate to talk a little bit about what results we're looking at as far as what we would anticipate being important trends

Yes. So we're measuring a number of endpoints in the study, from clinical end points, patient measured end points as well as biomarkers of the inflammatory response. And so if we see a trend in the right direction in the clinical response, whether it be hospitalizations or even the percentage of patients showing low oxygen level, or if we see a mitigation of the inflammatory response, we would view this as very positive and very helpful for us to move forward with the rest of the program

The other thing is that we will get data from this program, and that will also inform on the capability of KB109 working more broadly, not just in COVID-19, but potentially in other respiratory virus infections, as well as for the impact of MMTs on inflammatory diseases more broadly. So that's what we're hoping to see. And we hope to have these data very quickly

Yes. And so coming back, and just to summarize again, Terence. On the opportunity, if we see any benefit, obviously, there's a lot of discussion about is there going to be a second wave of the COVID-19? What about other potential respiratory viral infections? And certainly, if we see a benefit from this clinical study and things moving in the right direction, we will be ready and able to work with the FDA for that fastest route forward. And that also ties in, I think, with your last question around costs because it links directly to manufacturing. And just to remind you again that KB109, like all of our MMTs, it's a synthetic glycan and we actually use small molecule-like processing in our manufacturing. So it's very easy to scale. In fact, with KB195, sorry, our lead program, of course, we've already shown that we've been able to scale efficiently where we did that with our contract manufacturer, Thermo Fisher, in 6 months we scaled that production

So we're confident we can scale manufacturing, and the costs are going to be right in line with kind of the small molecule typical pharmaceutical costs. Mike, I don't know if you want to add any additional comment to that

Thanks, Alison. And appreciate the question, Terence. Look, as Kate mentioned in the prepared remarks, this is a controlled study, but it's also open label. So we'll be able to monitor progress as this goes. And that, I think, will provide a lot of clarity as we interact with both the FDA and make decisions around scaling up beyond this initial trial to have supply of 109 available. So it's an appropriate rate of design from a patient safety standpoint, but it also affords us the opportunity to monitor what kind of response we're seeing. And if it looks positive, that's just articulated on the clinical and/or the biomarkers of immune response, we'll be in a position then to work with our partners to start preproduction, if you will, before the final study data are available

Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley

This is Connor on for Matthew. So just a couple from us. You touched on them briefly, a couple of them. But could you just comment on current enrollment status for the UCD trial? And I guess, you mentioned that maybe you're likely pushing out enrollment by 6 months, but we were just wondering if you could provide any insight on how enrollment stands at present. And then just on the COVID trial, is there any sort of margin of improvement that you'd be willing to guide on in terms of any of the end points you mentioned that you'd need to see to bring it forward? And then just lastly, can you comment briefly on the profile or pretreatment status of the mild to moderate UC patients in the new KB295 study?

Thanks, Carter. I've got 3 parts, and I just want to clarify. So the first question is around enrollment of UCD. Let me address that first, and then I'll come back to your other 2 questions

So in the enrollment in UCD, we're not providing details at this point of how many patients have been enrolled. And we're guiding on 6 months -- that's what we're anticipating as far as the sites being able to come back online and start enrolling. And of course, the patients that we have enrolled and we have data on so far, will be added to the pool of the additional patients that we plan to continue to enroll

I do want to also just remind or mention again that we've expanded enrollment with an amendment to expand the age group so that we are confident, when we start that enrollment, it should go smoothly

The second question I have, Carter, is around the margin of improvement in the different clinical symptoms. And I think it's really difficult to say any single one that we would expect to see certain cutoffs as far as improvements. I think that like many of these clinical studies, it's going to be looking across a broad range. And as the FDA would say, looking at the totality of the evidence and seeing trends in the right direction for many of those different things, including, I think, importantly, the biomarkers of inflammation along with trends in some of the clinical signs and symptoms that we're going to be recording

And then the third question I have, I'd actually ask you to repeat, please, Carter, because I heard you mentioned KB295 and UC. But I wasn't completely clear on the question. And I apologize, I just realized I've been calling you Carter instead of Connor

No worries at all. I get it more often than you might think. So we were just wondering on the pretreatment status of patients that you plan to enroll in the UC 295 study?

Okay. I'll ask Kate to comment on that one. Thanks, Connor. Got it right that time

These are patients who are not yet on biologic therapy, so they can be 5-ASA or [in some mean] or ages like that, but not severe to require biologics

Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Fye with JPMorgan

This is Daniel for Jessica Fye. On the COVID-19 studies, can you elaborate -- can you walk us through the decision to evaluate clinical outcomes following 2 weeks of treatment? What gives you the confidence that those 2 weeks of treatment is sufficient to translate into that clinical benefit?

Yes, sure. Kate, do you want to comment on that?

Yes. So we, specifically, not only are looking at the 2 weeks of treatment but also 3 weeks of follow-up because we know that the course of COVID-19 can be several weeks. What we wanted to do was to make sure that we treated patients during the more inflammatory phase of their disease. And so we're going to be looking at those inflammatory markers, both after treatment and during the follow-up, and also looking at their recovery and whether or not they require extra care. So I think 5 weeks is going to be enough for us to be able to see a difference

And I would also add that we know, with our MMTs, that we see a change in the microbiome -- the production of the microbiome metabolites of (inaudible) very quickly after starting dosing. And so in that 2-week period, we would certainly anticipate seeing a change in the short-chain fatty acid profile that we're looking for to impact the immune system. And the 2 weeks, of course, is what we also know about the course of the disease as far as that's a critical period from testing before patients may end up in the hospitals. And so with the goal again of treating in that period, to avoid the consequences and avoid patients from going into the hospitals, which is where the real need is in the system, I think we have confidence that KB109 for that duration of treatment has the opportunity to show an effect

Got it. On the KB174 program, with prior expectations for study starts in second half '20, which now seems to be contingent upon finding a partner, is it fair to say that you have already initiated partnership discussions? And why now instead of waiting after getting more data? And if you could elaborate, what type of partnerships are you looking for?

Yes. So you were cut off just as you started that question, but I think it relates to KB174 and hepatic encephalopathy program. So as you know, Daniel, we had very positive results in a clinical study that we reported at the -- I think it was in December now or early January, I forget, the time has gone by so quickly. But that was in cirrhosis patients where we showed that we were able to reduce the production of ammonia by the microbiome, which was a very important study to show with KB174 as well as show the safety of it. As a result, we had a number of parties interested in following up on discussions. And we are, like, continuing those potential discussions with partners. And at this point, we believe that, that's the best path forward. I don't want to comment any further at this point around speculating what that may look like. Mike, I think you may have a comment to add here as well?

Yes. Thank you, Alison. I just wanted to raise -- remind everyone, that given the current crisis that we're in, this decision really is one of convenience, in that it is -- given our frameworks, a lot of uncertainty of what's going to happen with COVID-19 in the developed world, et cetera, right? So we all acknowledge that there's uncertainty here. It wouldn't be possible to enroll patients in this study currently that we have designed this next study simply in order to protect these patients with failing livers from undue exposure to COVID-19. Given that, plus the interest that has attended to partnering this program subsequent to the delivery of the data in the cirrhotic patients that Alison identified, it just made sense to us to gate the start of this study, which we're very excited about on achieving this partnership, and that also will allow the -- hopefully, the health care system to start rebounding to the point where it's safe for patients with failing livers, who are otherwise not having acute illness, to come into a center and be -- started in the study and monitored appropriately and so forth

All right. And one more question. On 295, one of the assessments was the impact on Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index. Why not also look at the Mayo -- the live side of the Mayo score?

Yes. Kate, would you like to comment on that for us?

Yes. So there are a number of scores out there that we could use to simplify. Activity score is actually well correlated with the Mayo score. And so we feel confident that it will be a very good instrument for us to use in this study

Our next question comes from the line of Gbola Amusa with Chardan

This is Sam Lee on behalf Gbola. I have a couple of questions and a follow-up, and some of them actually have been answered a little bit already. But number one, can you provide some color on the rationale behind the protocol amendments for 195, expanding the range from -- age range from 12 to 70 -- to 12 to 70, I'm sorry, from 18 to 65? Is that COVID-19 related?
 And two, for the Phase II UNLOCKED trial in KB195 in UCD, do you find that the COVID-19 pandemic is disrupting the collection and/or the quality of the endpoints in any way? In other words, the fasting plasma ammonia and the 24-hour plasma ammonia and under the curve end points

Okay. Thanks for the question. So first of all, let me start with your question around the age range for the protocol for the UNLOCKED study. It has always been our intention to expand the age range. As you probably know, a number of patients with UCDs involve and include children and adolescents and infants. And so as we've collected sufficient data required, we've had the opportunity to submit the amendment and expand that age range. So that was always our intention. And it's just fortuitous, if you like, as far as timing, ready for enrolling that broader age group once we are able to start enrollment, again, at the clinical sites

With regards to the collection of endpoint plasma ammonia, for example, as you can imagine, this is one of the issues with patients coming into sites and, really, collection of blood samples. We've been doing a lot of work in looking at how we can do more remote monitoring and visits and collection of blood samples. And so all of that has been part of our consideration in thinking about getting the study up and running again as soon as the sites can be started

As you can imagine, in the COVID-19 environment and the clinical studies, there are many different options in looking at kind of nurses doing home visits instead of asking patients to come into sites, those types of things

Right, of course. I guess to follow up on that for these clinical programs. In addition to that, what other measures are being taken to keep the trials running? You mentioned maybe potentially nurse visits and such. But would the patients still need to visit the sites at all? And have there been any FDA discussions to adjust the trial design? And if so, how so?

So I'll maybe ask Kate to comment further on any adjustments to the study. There have not been any discussions with the FDA to adjust the trial design other than the amendment that we have made to expand the age range for enrollment criteria. But Kate, maybe you want to talk about some of the work that we've been doing to facilitate patients enrolling once we get up and started again

Yes. And just to reiterate, to make this study as easy on patients as possible, we started out the study with as much remote visits -- as many remote visits as we could because we knew that, that could potentially be a burden. And we're currently looking into ways to provide even more remote monitoring as we open up. So we will be looking at whether or not there requires any further conversations with the FDA, but we know from guidance that these kinds of changes are well within the realm of things that we can do

I just wanted to -- the other thing is that you asked a question about the quality of the end points that we're collecting. There's been no impact on the quality of the endpoints that we've been measuring in this study due to COVID-19. I just wanted to make that clear

And maybe I'll just make one more comment. Again, because we have clinical sites across 10 different countries, we have the opportunity for different sites to start at different times as different countries is at different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic

Got it. And one more final question. In terms of the nonclinical programs, immuno-oncology and cardio-metabolic liver diseases, you did mention guidance that they should still be on track. But I'm just wondering how you guys are facilitating the benchmark in terms of continuing it during the pandemic and how you're adjusting

Yes. No, it's a great question. And we have worked very closely with the -- our partners, both at Gustave Roussy, who did close down for a little while in Paris. And we know that they're planning to get up and started again. We've been working very closely and coordinating with them and our other laboratories who've been doing this work. We've also initiated some animal work at other sites, as China was coming back online much faster than some of the other countries. We took the opportunity to make sure we had backup plans and animal work starting in China so that we could ensure we are on track here

So I think with the understanding of where we are, working closely with our partners and contractors in the labs on this, as well as knowing that the good stuff we see matter are coming back online, we have confidence that we can deliver this data still in Q4 of this year

Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer section. I would now like to turn the call back to Alison Lawton for closing remarks

Thank you, and thanks for some great questions there and for joining us on the call this morning. While the first quarter posed unexpected and unprecedented challenges for us as it did for most companies, I have to say I'm very proud of the team and their flexibility and dedication and commitment to our science as well as ensuring that our clinical trials and development programs have been able to continue to evolve. And I'm particularly excited about this opportunity that we have to be part of the broader endeavor to better understand the cause of COVID-19, and how we might moderate the course of the disease with the goal of easing the burden on the health care system and the hospitals as well as, of course, potential future serious viral respiratory infections, more broadly

So I'd like to conclude by thanking the patients and their families, our investigators and clinicians who've been involved in all of our clinical studies, as well as our great team here at Kaleido for making it all possible. And have a great day, everybody. Thank you

Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Saga Communications Q2 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn this over to your host, Ed Christian, President and CEO of Saga Communications. Sir, the floor is yours

Thank you, Catherine. And Sam Bush is with me, and he will speak momentarily, but at least Sam, Catherine was good enough to say welcome to, rather than unwelcome to Saga for the conference call

We have some good things to talk about and some harsh reality to deal with. So with that, Sam?

Thank you, Ed. This call will contain forward-looking statements about our future performance and results of operations that involve risks and uncertainties that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent Form 10-K. This call will also contain a discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation for all the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are attached in the selected financial data table

The second quarter was materially impacted by business and service provider closures, restrictions and other government-mandated actions. From the gross revenue low point in April when Saga's gross revenue was down 55% compared to the prior period in 2019, our revenue has significantly recovered in each of the following months, with July's gross revenue being down approximately 29%

And I think it's important to point out that from a broadcast cash flow perspective, only April was negative, while May and June both showed positive broadcast cash flow. We do expect to show positive broadcast cash flow for the year if the current market conditions continue due to our efforts to reduce expenses and with the expectation that we will see ongoing month-to-month revenue improvements. We had more cash on hand at the end of the second quarter, $48.9 million compared to the end of first quarter of $46.3 million. We expect there to be some fluctuation in this amount as the year continues but we do not believe, it will be reduced by any material amount by year end

Again, this is if the current market conditions continue, and we don't face another prolonged government-mandated shutdown in our markets

At the end of the quarter, our outstanding debt remained $10 million, which given the cash on hand, presents no covenant or liquidity issues. I'm sure a lot of other broadcasters and businesses as a whole will be envious of this statement

I want to point out that Saga's reported net loss for the first 6 months was $3.2 million but only $564,000 after adjusting for the noncash impairment charge, net of the tax benefit associated with the impairment charge

Ed, with that short commentary on an unprecedented quarter, I will turn it back over to you

Thank you, Sam. For the last few days, I've been listening to other conference calls. And I am kind of numbered out because as when listening to the calls, it's -- we're down this, we're down that. The numbers are there and here is what it is. And after a while, you just kind of glaze over because we know what they're going to be. And it's interesting because for all the years that I've been in this business, we kind of run in -- even though we're all independent operators in -- or public companies or whatever it might be. But the trend is amazing in terms of how it really sticks together and holds true across the entire country. I was talking with another broadcaster the other day who is -- has about as many markets as we have, but they're not in a single one of our markets. And we said, okay, come on, let's share some stuff here. How did you do during the quarter? And what are you seeing going forward? And we went through the numbers. And within 1 percentage point, we were the same as this company. Totally different markets, similar sizes, mid-market, but it was a very interesting experience. But I really need to ask everybody's permission here to just kind of digress from the numbers for a minute and really begin to look behind the numbers. What do they mean? And that's the issue that we really have to get down to is when we look at the numbers, they don't really tell us much. It shows a percentage of business down, and we can start breaking it into categories and try and say, okay, in this category, in medical, we were down 42% or 55% or whatever the number is. What does it really mean? Where does it come from?
 Now admittedly, there were parameters set where the governors closed business, made certain things on that. And those are the things that we can't change. There's nothing we can really do to entice somebody in to advertising during those points in time. But what about the other ones? And what did we learn about our experience here and doing an analysis on it?
 Well, I think there was a lot of things that came out of it for us. And one of the things that we really began to see early on was that a lot of good businesses who didn't need to close were closing because of fear. And I think that's really what happened in a lot of areas was that the fear factor came into play or a business person would say oh, my god, if I don't stop spending right now, I could lose my business. I could lose everything I have. I could be upside down. And I always remember a lot of quotes from one of my favorite, I guess, it would be an intellectual in Edmund Burke said back in the 1700s, mid-1700s, "no passion efficiently robs the mind of all of its powers of acting and reasoning as fear does." And I think that's really true. I mean, really no passion effectively robs the mind of all of its powers of acting and reasoning as does fear

So what we're saying here is that what we learned was that we had to really change the paradigm. We had to change the way we were selling. We had to be more enabling with the client, more encompassing of the client and their problems. So we began to understand that they were not advertising because -- not because they couldn't, because they were afraid to advertise

That's a very interesting distinction, but it's true. And we found that out. So we really had to change the method, the way that we were working with them. We didn't let them validate their fear because we came in and really worked with them in different ways to show them why they had to be advertising during a pandemic. Why they had to be doing this and what they can do. And we targeted certain ones that we knew that had the potential to do so but were afraid if they spent the money and they didn't get a return that they could be going out of business

And there's one of the things that I've learned over the years, sometimes the hard way. But I remember one of my first radio jobs in sales. And the owner of the radio station in Detroit, Michigan, said to me, did I ever tell you the story about the man who sold hotdogs? And then I go, no. And he said, okay, let me tell you the story. There was a man who lived by the side of the road and he sold hotdogs. He was hard of hearing, so he had no radio, had trouble with his eyes, so he read no newspapers. But he sold good hotdogs. He put up signs on the highway telling how good they were. He stood on the side of the road and cried, buy a hotdog mister and people bought. He increased his meat and bun orders. He bought a bigger stove to take care of his trade. He finally got his son home from college to help him out. But then something happened

Son said, father, haven't you been listening to the radio? I like that line. Haven't you been reading the newspaper? Don't like that. There's a big depression. The European situation is terrible. The domestic situation is worse

Whereupon the father thought, well, my son has been in college and he reads the papers. And he listens to the radio, so he ought to know. So the father cut down on his meat and bun orders, took down his advertising signs. And no longer bothered to stand on the highway to sell his hotdogs. And his hotdog sales fell almost overnight. You're right, son, the father said to the boy. We certainly are in the middle of a great depression

Again, once again, the idea of being influenced into having the wrong thoughts. So we really decided that we would go after and do a lot of great things to try and change the relationship with our people. And let me just tell you a few of the things we did because I'm really proud of what we came up with from the stations. And Chris Forgy did an outstanding job of communicating all of the ideas out. And that is from March through June 20, during the -- I hate to use the word, pandemic, our markets, Saga markets, donated over $10 million to local advertisers. Yes, we would go into them and say that, look, you shouldn't stop. Well, but business is really tough, and I don't know if I'm going to make payroll or everything else. All right. But you can't stop because you need to continue your marketing. So we're going to carry it for 2 months. We're going to do it. Don't worry about it. Don't ask any questions. Your commercials will stay on the air because we know that you need to keep your top of mind awareness. We need to know you have your presence there. And the clients will look at us unbelievably. What you're going to give us free advertising? No, it's not free advertising. It's letting you know that you're a valued relationship to us. Since you've been with us for 10 years. And now it's our turn to help you as you have believed in us, now we believe in you, and we're not going to let you down during this time right here. By the way, this number does not include the value of free promotional time supplied to local businesses to promote curbside pickup and shopping local, et cetera. That was totally other different campaigns we did for them

We also identified and created and sold a new creative ideas to emerging categories that are not typically radio advertisers. This, again, it gets down to the fact that traditionally, radio has sold certain categories, the sellers go out and call the same people, get the same results, nothing else changes. And we said, there's a lot of people out there that could benefit from using radio and the reach on radio. And so we went out and we started looking at them, finding unusual categories

Recruitment. We all know about that one. Sleep apnea clinics, yes. Ear, nose and throat doctors. Yes, pawn shops, metal roofing, personal injury and bankruptcy attorneys, residential real estate, contractors, HVAC, doors and windows, aftermarket auto parts, optometry, pet daycare grooming facilities. And the idea that we sold was Too Hot For Spot. Okay. That's a good one. And it was a combination, public service and advertising campaign, providing helpful hints on how to keep your pet safe from extreme heat during the summer. Hair salons, obviously, they couldn't be open. But what we did was we had an on air campaign during the pandemic called Show Us Your Roots. Since many hair salons were closed during the start of the pandemic and consumers weren't able to get their highlighted. The promotion was a fun way to support the local hair salons and keep them up on top of mind, while at the same time, it provided hair salons with leads to those who entered the contest. And we created all these new initiatives for our sellers and (inaudible). We also gave away just on the air, and we talked about the (inaudible), be giving away $15,000, $10,000 and $5,000 in advertising to clients. All you have to do is go to our website and register your name. And we'll do a drawing. And we'll have 3 winners. One will get $15,000 in free advertising across the platform of stations we have in the market. Other one will get $10,000, one will get $5,000. And it would average about 400 people registering for this

Now you're wondering, okay so you're giving way free advertising. Well, the ones that did, and it was a drawing, were just ecstatic about this, oh my God, I can't believe that. We get free advertising. We can continue on doing what we're doing. And by the way, we also then got 400 leads of businesses that we knew that were advertising. And we sent our salespeople out with $500 gift certificates and had them go in and talk to the owner and say, listen, we're sorry, you didn't win. But here, just from us, is a certificate for $500 that you can use at any time to advertise on the stations and just mail us the certificate and we'll work with you on that, and we'll get it done

So what we do -- by doing this, we created 400 lead opportunities to divide it up amongst the sellers and did that. The other thing that we did is we produced over 4,000 spec spots for our local advertisers in 3 months. 4,000 new commercials in 3 months to present to them as idea starters for it

So we look at this, and these are the things that actually kept us from being down further. And it allowed us to get to a lower level where we are now in the high 20s and going down from there to try to restore a level of normalcy. But if we can cure the fear factor and we can make this a fun factor, then we're so much further ahead in the business. And the other thing we've been doing is train, train, train. I can't tell you the amount of training and retraining that goes into this. And the new people that we've hired in sales are a clean slate. They're not coming in and say, well, look, we've been doing it this way for 20 years. They don't know the difference. And when we tell them to go out and call on this product category, a lot of the senior sellers would say, oh, they're not going to buy. But the new ones will go out and just power right through and do that. Change is here. Change is occurring. Changes is what's happening in our business, and we have to stand behind it. And that's exactly what's going on here. And we're also selling long-term and again, it's great with the young sellers coming in that they're suddenly -- if you tell them, look, we only sell in 10 weeks or 12 weeks. Another seller would go on who's been there for a long time, and so I can get a $500 order for next week. Now we don't want that. We're in for the long term. We're building and rebuilding our business. So this has been a terribly challenging and terribly painful time for us in broadcasting. It has also given us a chance to feel reinvigorated with a new commitment that we have towards doing what we do to service our communities. We chose to be in mid-markets, where we actually can make a difference. Where we can know that people listen and respond to us because they depend upon us for what goes on in the community. And we're using that power and the power of being able now to change the way we've been doing business and bringing ourselves into a new relationship and a new era is going to pay off very much so in the long term. We are concentrating and building on local direct and local direct services. And that's where the bread and butter is going to be and that's where the future of local radio is. And that's where it is. I'm not worried about cheap spots from a national -- on national. That's gone from the game. That's changed. Let's do and control what we can control and let's do it the right way, and we'll be in great shape on this. I just want to be the best that we can be in our particular era -- area, era too, but that's where it is. And no, it was not a good quarter. As I said, painful for all of us. And you sit here each week and go, Oh, and then you have to begin to understand what happened. And that's what we did. And I just want to thank you all for listening to my rambles, I guess, this morning. But I hope I gave you an idea and a vision of what we're trying to accomplish at Saga. It's been our goal. We've been in business 34 years. I thought it was bad in 2008. That was a walk in a park compared to what we've experienced. And if everything is right and our projections hold, even though we have no real visibility in terms of going forward on this. But if we do, we'll get through this. We'll be fine. And a sense of normalcy will return to what has become a very harried industry in the last several months

But bear with us. We'll do what's right. We'll get through this

And Sam, I don't think we have any questions today, do we?

No, we did not have any questions today, Ed

All right. Do you have any questions?

No. But I can say I always like my comments, but yours are always much more fascinating to listen to. So thank you for that

Well, go buy yourself a hotdog, keep the old man happy

I will do so

Catherine, you can wrap this thing up, and we're out of here

Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time. And have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Saga Communications Q3 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)
 It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Ed Christian, President and CEO of Saga Communications. Sir, the floor is yours

Catherine, thank you very much, and welcome, everybody. We have a lot of information to convey to you and some other additional thoughts. And with that, let me start by turning it over to Sam Bush, as usual

Thank you, Ed. This call will contain forward-looking statements about our future performance and results of operations that involve risks and uncertainties that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent Form 10-K. This call will also contain a discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation for all the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are attached in the selected financial data table

The third quarter continued to be materially impacted by the COVID pandemic, but as reported in the press release, we have seen significant increases in net revenue every month from the low point in April. Our net revenue in the third quarter was $24.1 million compared to $16.9 million in the second quarter. This is an increase of $7.3 million or 43.1% between the second and third quarters

Gross political for the quarter was $1.8 million. For the second quarter, it was $289,000 and for the 9 months ended September 30, 2020, it was $3.1 million

As I already indicated, net revenue was up $7.3 million from the second to third quarter. So political certainly helped, but was not an overriding factor. Political continued to be strong in October and for the first few days of November. So we expect October to be our highest revenue month for the year with November remaining strong, but falling below October as political revenue was finished yesterday

Without political, we expect gross revenue to continue a positive trend throughout the rest of the year. Our focus on local continues to pay off as the combined local direct and local agency increased 32.4% between the second and third quarters of this year. We have $49.8 million in cash on hand as of November 2 compared to approximately $44 million at the beginning of the year. We expect there to be some fluctuation in this amount as the year continues, but we believe that our cash balances will continue to increase as we get to year-end. Again, this is if the current market conditions continue, and we don't face another prolonged government-mandated shutdown in our markets

At the end of the quarter, our outstanding debt remained $10 million, which given the cash on hand, presents no covenant or liquidity issues. Leverage per our bank covenants calculates at 0.82%, but is really negative when you consider the cash we have on hand

Ed, with that short commentary on what continues to be an unprecedented year, I will turn it back over to you

It could be precedented year, I don't know, Sam. But let me ask you a quick question. What did you compute the other day that the value of the cash per share of what it's currently trading at is like, what, $6? Something around that?

Yes. Around number $6 per share

Okay. So I'm just checking that up

Hello, everybody, and let's start in on this with me saying that it's been a long 9 months, and we have not burned $1 of your money. There's been no cash burn at this company, which I think unto itself, is a pretty good achievement. And we accomplished this through a number of different ways, and let's talk about that for a second

One was, obviously, 2 things that you have to do is one is try to find a way to reverse the slide and bring it back up so that it decelerates each month in terms of that and begins to build back up a little bit. We haven't seen the rebuilding from ground 0 yet from -- or normalcy as it was from 2019. But nevertheless, we've had some really interesting things happen

Let me tell you, for instance, that if we look at our local direct, and for those of you who have been on the call before know that Saga's big proponent of doing, reaching, teaching, selling directly to retailers, to service providers, to a number of the businesses like that. Right now, we're running about $1.5 million per month ahead of our local direct. Overall probably our local directors, excuse me, $1.5 million over our local agency, which is pretty impressive for us. It really continues our commitment and accelerates it, which is -- we're very happy about that

We're adding more programs to promote nontraditional revenue. We're doing, for instance, best of books with sales component attached to it, which is bought in hundreds of thousands of dollars and the lack of -- because of the lack of nontraditional revenue

Where we have been impacted and it's a good, healthy number is in events. And a station that is attuned to the community is constantly looking for events to provide for the community. And I am finding ways for us to monetize those events. And it goes from concerts that we sponsor in Ocala to plays. We are behind in various performing venues across in our markets

So we have a lot of things going that generate additional income. So we've been impacted because we're not able to reach out and have masses of people or numbers of people even attending our events, and that was a big part of what we did. And that really hurt when the country was shut down. And even now today, we're seeing that there's no shutdowns in Massachusetts and Illinois. We're just rechanged and recategorized in certain counties

So while the competitors are off-boarding salespeople, which is what's happening, we are actually hiring them and adding services and account executives. We're very big in the idea of retraining our new salespeople or training -- retraining existing salespeople and training the new salespeople

We're using a number of different programs when we bring in new sales people. P1, the RAB, Radio Advertising Bureau has a tremendous program and Cash by Creative, there's a number of different programs that we are showing and telling to our people. We're -- and then we're also breathing the people that we have for the future. Because we believe sincerely that there is a future without a doubt, there is a future on this

Just to give you one example. We work with [Jeff Smith] and Kim Johnson at the Radio Advertising Bureau, and they did for us a special 6-week virtual training session for Saga own way, where we took a number of our senior salespeople. And nine of them took the course for 6 weeks, and they just earned their credentials as certified radio sales managers. These are people that are there for us in the future because we've been building our team and building our field on what we're doing. So it's keeping in content, keeping in promotions where we're still trying to figure out ways to do for promotions

Examples, some of the ones that we have right now that we did for promotions, and it just occurred to me to mention this is we did a number of virtual Halloweens. And in Champagne, Illinois, for instance, we did it at the Champagne County fairgrounds, where we had 30 merchants with booths or tents along the road inside the area there. And passing out candy to each car that stopped, and we had a line, it's probably 1.5 mile long outside of cars waiting to get in with their kids in their Halloween costume to enter into the area and do it. It was all sponsored by us exclusively. And the [story] invited paying businesses were there to hand out information to the parents. We did quite a bit there. We also, in one of the other events that is kind of important to mention right now is, we did a program for sponsorship to support first responders, the police and fire. We did imaging and the conversational messages with top officials, discussing relevant community issues, and what is brought to you by at the end. And that's created hundreds of thousands of dollars for us. We've done it in 18 of our markets so far, and we're rolling it out in all of the markets, and that will be happening pretty soon

So one of the other things that we're doing now to reposition the station because I think it's -- well, Paul Romer, who's an economist and Nobel Prize winner, he's a Stanford economist, had a great line, it says, in a crisis -- a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. And what we've been doing is using this, while other companies are offloading talent. We have been raising and hiring those talents and improving our stature in terms of professionalism. It's been really great. While the other ones are having risk, we are hiring talent. So we're taking advantage as much as we can of what is going on in the community

This is all a part of the idea that we have here of keeping Saga fresh and current even in downturns times right now. This has been a very important part to us to be able to have what we do and be able to say, hey, listen, we're still making money, not the kind we want to, but the kind we want to will be coming. We don't know exactly the definition yet of when coming is because it's subject to a number of variables. But by doing the things that we have been doing, by increasing the commitment to our salespeople, bringing in new salespeople and training them in the new methodology of selling. And there is one, by the way. The things have changed in terms of how we're doing it. It's not the same old radio sales of 20 years ago, but it's using new more inventive things. It's also relying upon digital advertising sales as a component to what we're doing

So in every area, every single department that we have, there has been a concentration and a commitment to make them better during this time. So that when a sense of normalcy returns and other people begin to open up their radio stations, and by the way, which we never closed any of our stations. But when they open up the radio stations again to try to resume business, we're ahead of the pack on that. And that's part of the whole idea of what we do is try to position ourselves in the community as community leaders, community relations, one-on-one relationships with our advertisers, and we'll get back there. And the very fact that we haven't had anything embarrassing occur to us in the last 9 months, I think, is applauded to all the people who work for the company and who really work hard to see what they're doing

I'm pleased as much as one can be pleased. That's a very touching thing right there. But I'm pleased with what we're doing. What I'd like to see more, of course. Am I going to see more? Yes. We have that commitment behind there that we're not going away. We're not going to fold up. It's unfortunate that radio stations have closed in a country and some licenses have been mailed back to the government, and that's more in some of the smaller markets

But it happens. And we're seeing even large companies turning unnecessary radio licenses. We're not. We're actually looking for some acquisitions in our market field. I won't say smaller markets, but that's a relative term, but we're doing that. So what I ask is your understanding and your patience. And we're no different than a lot of other companies that got whacked. Only we're trying to do proactive things to change this, and the proactive things are in sales and that's what is important to us

There -- I got -- I'm big in quotes and things like that, as you know. And I saw one the other day, I thought it was pretty good now to sum this up here. And that is one from Arthur Rubenstein. For lovers of you who may not be familiar with him, he was a concert pianist from 8 decades as one of the finest contra pianist in the world. He was an expert in Chopin, and he had a great thing. He said there was no formula for success except perhaps an unconditional acceptance of life and what it brings. And why did that reside with me. And that's what we have is we have to face the issues that we have and deal with and fix our company, keep our company strong, keep our company focused, keep finding ways to grow the company, to inspire the people in a company to be committed to the company, to have that in their heart knowing that this is the company that will be long-standing, whereas some others might go by the wayside because of economic conditions

And Sam, with that, I'm going to wrap up my comments after you've got -- I don't know. Do we have some questions today?

Questions and Answers

Yes, we do. We have 2 questions today

That's nice. That's nice

It is, it is. Somebody cares

The first question is..

Only 2 people care, I guess

The first question is, do you see a stabilization of revenue or a continuing downward trend or what?

Well, that's a good open-ended question. It depends. And that's not a ducking answer. But let me just share some information. And like any good scout, I always keep my ear down to the railroad track. So I can tell when the trains are coming. And that's an old thing I don't really put my ear to the track, Sam, just so you get that straight. What I'm hearing is in the larger markets, the top 10, top 25, whatever it is. There is a fear that they have reached a new norm, which in the larger markets is running like minus 20 from comparable years. And the fear is that this is going to be where they are. And for several months, they've kind of hung in there, and they're not seeing minus 15, minus whatever it is. In the secondary markets where we operate, we do have some -- we are not in the top 25, but I think 7% of our stations are in the top 50 or 25 to 50, whatever it is. It's more down in the lower teens, 12%, 14% and holding kind of right there for now

Now, is that going to change? Well, that all depends. It depends on where the economy goes and everything else. But it seems that the larger markets are getting hit harder than the secondary markets where you have more ball control over what you do in terms of sales where you can be creative. And you have a smaller universe to play in, but a bigger playing field within that universe itself. So do I see anything catastrophic coming up? No. But that could change tomorrow. That's asking me to look into some sort of magic ball and figure that out or do it in the (inaudible) board like we did years ago

That if we get down to 12%, and that becomes a new normal for a while, we're okay. Because we have made, as you noted, and they're without giving exact figures. We have reduced our overhead substantially without impacting the effect of our organization. We've had no risk to speak up. We don't go in there with wholesale laying off of people and announcing a 40 or 50 people are gone. That hasn't happened with us. We have crafted surgically, literally, a pass that reduces expenses that holds us there. So we're good. But the question is, is it 20%? Is it 12%? It depends on the marketplace. It depends on the size of the market, and it depends on the station itself. So it's a very hard question to answer. Am I optimistic? Yes. Do I think that we're going to be right back to where we were last year? No

I think 2021 is going to be another slagging year as long as the economy keeps some momentum moving forward. And it's not a quick turnaround is other issues

Okay. That's my answer

Very good. And the second question is, Nielsen has made a policy change under which it will no longer include the ratings for nonsubscribing radio stations in the summary data set that fuels the major buying systems used by agencies and advertisers. What revenue impact do you expect the policy change to have in Saga's markets where it doesn't subscribe to Nielsen ratings?

Well, okay. Good question, actually. It's the hot topic in the industry right now. I presume that, that's written by when the question comes in from one of the trades. I won't ask you then. We don't discuss that

Well, what I mean by first saying, there is no secret to this. And Saga is not a client of Nielsen. And so therefore, what I'm saying is not based on a client relationship with the Nielsen company. Let me explain to some of those who don't understand exactly what's going on here. Nielsen surveys 2 different sets of markets. One is the diary market, which is, in my opinion, a highly automated way of surveying, where you're asking a responder to carry personally a diary for 7 days and contemporaneously fill out line-by-line what he listens to, what radio station, what time it starts, what time it ends. And well, I'll give you an example on this. Because this will take a few minutes to answer. When I was an adjunct professor at Central Eastern University, one of the lectures that I did was with grad students. When talking about statistics and ratings and (inaudible) in broadcasting, radio and television, but primarily radio with that case. And we would sit down and I would say to them, and I had from Nielsen in that time diaries, they punch holes in them so they can't be used. And I pass them out to the -- it was like 15 grad students in the class

Past month, each one of them have looked at the kind of strange. So nicely explained to them. You're right now expected to, as a class exercise, carry this for a week and contemporaneously record your radio listening. These are, again, grad students, so we weren't talking about freshman or anything like that. Contemporaneously record your radio listening for 7 days and then mail diary back. And by the way, for this -- doing this and keeping this, I will give you a 6 pack of PBR, which at that time was about $5, which is what Nielsen has raised is what they pay. And I submit to you that, that was flying back 40 years ago when it was a proud thing to be a Nielsen to Emily or whatever it might be, and we have a responsibility to fill out on recording with that, but that doesn't happen now

So that's part of -- and the other one is the PPM, which is the meters that are attached to people's belts and it warrants for up to 2 years for listening. When they gather this information then and put it out and in the PPM form, there's plus or minus 2 standard deviations of the norm involved. So if you chose that you have an 8 share, you could have a 6 share or a 10 share, either one of them is statistically accurate. When they send this information out, people -- radio stations subscribe "to the information" and the same with the people meter, they subscribe for the information. It then is also sold to the advertising agencies at a highly discounted rate compared to what stations pay. And what they are doing now with this new proposal they've come in. And by the way, this has been creeping up because each -- several years, they cut out another feature punishing nonsubscribers like us. I won't say punishing but changing to benefit subscribers. And now there's -- the agency has got 2 levels of information, summary data and respondent data

Now the summary data is, basically, you get the information, you feed it into a strata computer, and it shows you exactly what the market looks like so that you can determine your buying

Now the summary data, which is what, 30? I don't know what percentage, but not all their subscribers. This is the basic one. And I think there's 65 -- they say 65% in one of their releases. 35%, we get the other, and I'll get to that in a second. But 35% get the summary data or vice versa, whichever it might be. I'm sorry, I'm not quite clear on that. If they get that, the summary data, they can put it in and see the entire market and make their buy at the agency level

By the way, I must say this is a terrible disservice to the advertising agencies by eliminating this. This, in many respects, invalidates the whole thing. On the last, you decide now that the summary data, which is most popular, is to be replaced by the respondent level data, which is more information than the agencies really need and therefore, really don't buy it. Because it's got ZIP code analysis and a lot of things that gets into -- very granular things for the meter and eventually for PPM acknowledgment

What Nielsen is doing is essentially increasing the rates by 50% or more to the individual agencies that subscribe to just the summary data. If you want the respondent data, in other words, eventually, the summary data will not be able to be used as buying service because by -- because it doesn't show the entire radio market. The number of AM radio stations that are there are probably going to go away or any of the secondary stations. However, as a kind of benevolent gesture, Nielsen is keeping the public radio stations in there, and I don't believe charging that much at all

Now for years, they wouldn't show up on NPR because they didn't consider them real forces in the advertising market. Now they do. But with this said, what happens is that every agency that has a conscience in terms of being responsible as buying service for the clients has to pay at least 50% more to get the respondent level data. And then because -- otherwise, you can't even manually enter it really. And you have to use Tapscan, which is a company that's owned by Nielsen. So that could be more. I'm not sure if that there's a thing on this. But Nielsen is blaming the radio stations, well, any station that doesn't subscribe shouldn't be shown. The agency shouldn't -- nobody exists unless you pay us 50% more and then you can see it. So it's unfair to blame the radio stations. We have enough relationship issues with Nielsen without pointing a finger and saying, bad dog, bad dog. And that's what's happening on this. I'm taking way too long to answer the question, and I really should kind of shut up on this

And I would be glad to discuss this with anybody that wants to know about it, wants to hear about the media rating console and how many markets they don't have in the PPM thing certified by MRC or the efficacy of the diary method or the way that they're approaching agencies, trying to put the blame for them forcing the agencies to pay more to get the same product they had with a summary level data

And I'll close yourself with the quote that I read this morning and another trade sheet right now from Jerry del Colliano. And Jerry's trade sheet this morning said, it's like doing a census, but not including the people who don't pay their taxes to Cesar as if they didn't exist. And this is essentially what is occurring here with Nielsen. Like it or don't. And I'm sure they're sitting there rumbling at me now for my diatribe. But all I want is honesty, and I want to have a level-playing field for everybody to going to show radio stations, and you're going to measure correctly and properly, and that leave out, in some cases, 40% of the radio market because they don't subscribe your service, that's punitive. And that just almost mean spirited in some respects. Have I said too much, Sam?

No, I think you've covered, and you certainly have said what you feel, as you always do, which is great

No, it's all logic

It is, totally

It is what it is. And nobody is taking the thing, they're being powered into, well, maybe we're better radio stations. You're not. Like us, we have the relationships with our clients one-on-one. They know what we can do in the community. And this is something that Nielsen has a little problem understanding is that radio stations can be successful through one-on-one client relationships because they can see and feel and touch and believe what happens in the community. I'm done. Okay

Absolutely, when somebody walks in their store and buys, they know why it's there, is why local direct is doing what it's doing, which is terrific

It works. Do I have time for one more quick story? In our -- the retraining of salespeople, our new salespeople. One of the things that we have kind of mandated is that you can't sell short. Everything has got to be long on it. And so one of the new salespeople went out there in one of the markets, and I'm not going to do who or where. But why don't and was trained, went through all the certification. And she was out calling out an HVAC dealer. This is a category we've really started working very heavily to get HVAC companies in. Because in a depressed economy or an under economy, if your air-conditioning or heater goes out, you need to call somebody. So she sat down and did the presentation to the owner of the HVAC location and went through it all. And he finally said, okay, yes, I think I'm trying radio. I know. Let's do it for 3 weeks. She said, sir, I'm sorry, I can't sell you 3 weeks. He said, fine. She said, no, sir, I would -- I can't -- our minimum at the radio station, it's 12 weeks. Because if we sold just 3 weeks, we wouldn't be doing you any good. Because there's not enough repetitions. There's not enough imaging, there's not enough chance for us for brand building and everything else like this. Finally, the guy said, okay, I'll take 12 weeks. Under the old school of thinking in a radio, the salespeople would come in and say, hey, I just scored so and so for 3 weeks for a new advertising. No. We're going in to prove the radio works and we do it for 12 weeks. That's where we get the results and get the returns from people. So now I can shut up and say, Catherine, please sign me off. Okay

Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation

Thank you, Catherine.
