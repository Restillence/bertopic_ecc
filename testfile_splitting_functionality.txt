With that out of the way, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob McKnight.

Good afternoon, everyone.

Thanks for joining us today for our second-quarter conference call.

I'd like to begin by welcoming the newest member of our Senior Management team, our new Chief Financial Officer, Richard Shields.

We're delighted that Rich has joined the Quicksilver family and, even though he's only been with us less than a month, he hit the ground running and we're looking forward to the many valuable contributions that Rich will make to the future success of Quicksilver.

Turning now to our business in Q2, I'm proud of the Quicksilver team's performance in the second quarter amid inconsistent economic conditions around the world.

While some of our emerging markets have shown strong progress, some established markets, particularly in Europe, have been impacted by regional economic uncertainty.

Despite the pressure on our business caused by this uncertainty, our brands have held up well and we're pleased to have grown our revenues across all three brands in all three regions and in each of our channels of distribution.

This was, however, a challenging quarter for our business from a margin perspective.

As we communicated back in March, we entered Q2 knowing that a number of factors would negatively impact margins in the quarter.

As the quarter progressed, a few of those dynamics became more impactful than we expected.

Importantly, some of those headwinds diminish as we move into the second half of our fiscal year.

Let me turn now to the high level financial highlights from the second quarter.

Revenues in Q2 were up 5% when compared to last year in constant currency, reflecting that we have broad appeal for all three of our brands Quicksilver, Roxy and DC, solid growth in our emerging markets, revenue growth and positive comparable store sales in each of our geographic regions, and continued strong growth in our eCommerce channel.

Gross margins declined to 49.2% of sales.

Our 2012 internal plan anticipated a number of headwinds that would adversely impact our Q2 year-over-year gross margin comparison.

Our actual margins were, however, somewhat below our plan.

SG&amp;A of $224 million was up approximately $7 million compared to the second quarter a year ago.

The resulting pro forma adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $39 million, which as we anticipated, was well below last year's second-quarter results.

Rich will take you through a more detailed look at our financial performance in a few moments.

But first, I'd like to provide a brief update on our three flagship brands.

Let's start with Quicksilver.

Revenues in Q2 for the Quicksilver brand grew 4% compared to the same quarter a year ago in constant currency.

This growth was fueled by strong sales of warmer weather goods, including board-shorts, amphibians, walk shorts, hats, and tank tops, as temperatures began to rise in connection with the arrival of spring.

During the quarter, we stepped up our collaborations with the major North American Sports Leagues, product for additional NFL teams shipped into the wholesale marketplace and sell-through was exceptionally strong in tourist destinations.

NBA board-shorts will follow with some teams introduced this summer and a deal with the NHL has been recently signed and Canadian NHL team board-shorts will be shipped in Canada this fall.

We're also expanding the program into Australian football leagues.

These collaborations allow Quicksilver to reach new customers, new accounts and new channels of distribution while delivering authentic products that are designed using already existing resources.

Revenues in Q2 for Roxy grew 5% compared to the same quarter a year ago in constant currency.

The Roxy brand continues to build momentum in the sportswear category through growth driven primarily by dresses, beach pants and light sweaters.

Roxy footwear and the Roxy girl line also performed well in the quarter.

On the marketing front, Roxy launched the Company's first ever global social media campaign in February called Let the Sea Set You Free inviting girls from all over the world to tell us why they are Roxy girls via social media platform.

The Roxy bus went on tour visiting retail locations and giving girls the opportunity to film themselves on-site with Roxy.

As measures of the program's reach, we received over 5,000 entries from more than 70 countries.

DC revenues in Q2 grew 13% compared to the same quarter a year ago in constant currency.

This performance was driven by strong growth across men's, women's and kid's footwear categories.

Top sellers included products at both the high end and lower end of the price point spectrum.

From a channel perspective, DC had a particularly strong quarter in department stores and we continued to enjoy solid online revenue growth through our own sites as well as those of our customers.

Focused on the innovation and technology that the DC brand has always been known for, DC launched the Coal Lite S in the second quarter.

Designed and tested by DC team skater Chris Coal, the Chris Coal Lite S is a better shoe for a better skater.

With its cleaner design, this more advanced skate shoe features DCs super lightweight unilite technology and it became one of our best sellers immediately upon its launch.

The second quarter for our athletes and events includes important early contest in the men's surfing schedule, a significant portion of the women's pro surfing schedule and the kickoff event in Street League skateboarding.

In that context, I'd like to take just a brief moment to mention a few of our athletes who inspired us and have helped us reach our important core demographic as well as a couple of key events we sponsor.

Fresh off the successful worldwide tour in support of his hit movie The Art of Flight, our own Travis Rice won the First Annual Red Bull Supernatural Back Country Snow Boarding Competition in British Columbia.

This contest featured the world's 18 best snowboarders in a series of events aimed at determining the best all around free style snowboarder on the planet.

Travis has certainly demonstrated that he deserved that title.

Four time world champion and Quicksilver team rider, Stephanie Gilmore, is at the top of the women's ASP World Title Race, once again after winning two of the 2012 seasons first three events, including the Roxy Pro Gold Coast and finishing second in another.

And immediately, behind Steph in the standings is Roxy team rider Sally Fitzgibbons who began 2012 on fire by winning the ASP six star events at the Australian Open of Surfing and Hunter Ports.

Since then, Sally is running a close second to Steph in the 2012 Women's ASP World Title race after winning tour events at Bells Beach and at Rio.

We recently hosted several key events in the world of competitive surfing and skating that attracted large audiences and successfully spread the brand stories.

In March the Quicksilver Pro and Roxy Pro Gold Coast surf contest played to a capacity crowd at Snapper Rocks with the world's best surfers putting on a spectacular display of high performance surfing.

The events back drop was our best of board riding campaign, which highlighted the collective strength and appeal of our three brand's team riders.

As I mentioned a moment ago, Quicksilver team rider, Stephanie Gilmore, won the Roxy Pro after edging out Roxy's Sally Fitzgibbons in the semi-finals.

On the men's side Quicksilver team rider, Kelly Slater, advanced to the quarter-finals of the Quicksilver Pro, and he continues to be the single largest attraction in the sport.

Back on the domestic soil, the Street League Skateboarding DC Pro tour kicked off its 2012 season at the Sprint Center in Kansas City.

Between the packed arena, live coverage on ESPN 2, and a huge online audience, the event provided valuable exposure for the brand and the sport.

The contest format was modified this year to reward performance under pressure and 17-year old phenom, Nyjah Huston, our newest addition to the DC skate team won the championship in a dramatic dual with Bastien Salabanzi, the tour's first European qualifier.

While we're on the topic of broadening the appeal for our brands, there may be no better pitch man for a brand than DC team skater, Rob Dyrdek, who was arguably action sports most popular television personality.

In addition to creating and hosting the Street League DC Pro tour on ESPN 2, Dyrdek's fantasy factory and ridiculousness weekly TV shows are continuing hits on MTV and MTV Europe.

Dyrdek's new cartoon series, Wild Grinders, premiered in April on the Nicktoons Network ranking as the highest rated telecast of the week for kid's and boy's age 6 to 11.

Collectively these athletes and events and promotions reflect our heritage and authenticity, while attracting more attention to our brands, helping us to appeal to a wider audience through television coverage, the internet and social media.

When you think about it, we have a great foundation for social media.

These dynamic athletes and high profile events that I just mentioned are good indicators of the reach of the sports we embrace and are positioned in the action sports community which is increasingly consumed and connected by social media.

As an authentic active participant in this community, we're now increasingly attracting our progressive consumer base to use our websites as the hubs of their interaction.

We naturally attract our target audience to our social media pages and websites through athlete interaction, our events, our media and our products.

The best athletes in our industry are all very active in social media.

We have the best line up in action sports.

And through the performances of these athletes, our marketing team develops fantastic media assets to make the social media environment even more attractive.

Our goal over time is to further establish our social media sites as the go to meeting places with -- where those who are passionate about action sports will listen in and join the conversation.

Okay, now to provide more color on our financial performance, Rich will now take you through our second-quarter financial details.

Thanks everyone for taking the time to join us this afternoon.

Consolidated second-quarter net revenues were $492 million, up $14 million, or 3% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2011 and up 5% in constant currency.

From a brand perspective, Quicksilver brand revenues were $209 million, up 1% compared to last year and up 4% in constant currency.

Roxy revenues were $135 million, up 3% compared to last year and up 5% in constant currency.

DC revenues were $131 million, up 11% compared to last year and up 13% in constant currency.

We were specifically pleased with the Quicksilver and Roxy brand's growth in the American region wholesale channel, as this is a key barometer of brand momentum.

Moving to a geographic perspective.

Revenues in the Americas were $221 million, up 5% compared to last year.

European revenues were $196 million, down 6% compared to last year, but up modestly in constant currency terms, as economic headwinds in Europe hindered our wholesale growth.

In the Asia Pacific region, revenues were $74 million, up 27% compared to last year and up 24% in constant currency.

Asia Pacific revenue growth reflects improved performance in Japan where revenue comparison's anniversary the second quarter last year, which included the aftermath of the natural disasters that struck Japan in March 2011.

Importantly, we had good growth in Japan and good growth in the Asia Pacific region outside Japan as well.

Next, moving to a distribution channel perspective.

Wholesale revenues were down 1% compared to the same quarter a year ago, but were up 2% in constant currency.

Our wholesale business in the Americas and Asia Pacific demonstrated good growth across all three brands.

Our Company owned retail stores generated comp store sales growth of 6% for the quarter on a global basis, and our eCommerce business enjoyed another good quarter delivering strong growth across all three brands and in all three regions.

Summarizing our second-quarter revenue performance, we're pleased that revenues were up in all three brands, up in all three regions and up in each of our distribution channels.

The DC brand, the Americas and the Asia Pacific regions, and our eCommerce channel led the revenue growth.

We're quite proud that our European team was able to report modest revenue growth in constant currency, while other companies are reporting decreasing sales in that region.

Consolidated gross margins contracted by 560 basis points to 49.2 percent of sales, compared to 54.8% in the second quarter a year ago.

Gross margin in Q2 2011 was a Company record as end of season inventory clearance activity was unusually low in that quarter and certain royalty revenues, which carry very high gross margin flow through, were more concentrated in the second quarter last year.

These factors work together to make Q2 of fiscal 2011 a tough comparison with respect to gross margin.

In contrast, as mentioned in our earlier conference call, this year we entered the second quarter with more substantial levels of prior season inventory, caused largely by the recent weak winter season.

Consequently, we liquidated more product in the clearance channel in Q2 this year.

To summarize, the Q2 year-over-year margin erosion was caused primarily by higher inventory clearance activity this year, the timing of certain royalties last year, higher sourcing costs, and unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates.

SG&amp;A expense of $224 million was up $7 million, or 3% compared to last year, with approximately $3 million of the increase due to higher non-cash stock compensation expense.

Other year-over-year SG&amp;A variances include increased expenses in our growing eCommerce business and higher depreciation expense as well as decreased spending in the wholesale selling costs and some reductions in the marketing area.

Second quarter pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $39 million was down $23 million compared to the same quarter last year.

Our 2012 internal plan anticipated a meaningful decline in EBITDA compared to Q2 of last year, driven by the anticipated gross margin contraction.

Our actual EBITDA performance was, however, somewhat below our internal plan.

Our pro forma consolidated loss for the second quarter was $3 million, or $0.02 a share, compared to pro forma income of $17 million, or $0.09 a share in the same quarter a year ago.

On a GAAP basis, the net loss was $5 million, or $0.03 a share, compared to a net loss of $83 million, or $0.51 a share in Q2 of fiscal 2011.

The net loss a year ago included a $74 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to our businesses in Australia and Japan.

Moving on to the balance sheet and working capital.

Receivables increased $29 million versus last year.

Our wholesale day sales outstanding metric increased by six days compared to Q2 of fiscal 2011 due to the timing of some cash receipts, the elimination of our early payment discount program and some credit term support for certain wholesale customers, as well as sales -- higher sales to our distributors.

The accounts receivable aging remains basically consistent with prior periods.

Inventory at quarter end was up $69 million versus last year.

Our day sales in inventory metric was up eight days compared to a year ago.

The DSI increase was driven by higher inventory held for clearance and the early receipts of goods to support our anticipated strong back-to-school season.

We anticipate that our day sales in inventory will end fiscal 2012, below the level at the end of fiscal 2011.

CapEx was $18 million in the second quarter, up $2 million compared to year ago, and included continued spending related to our ERP system implementation, which continues to be on schedule and on budget as well as continued investment in our retail stores and our eCommerce platform.

We ended the quarter with $690 million of net debt, up $45 million from last quarter.

Working capital management will be a larger area of focus for the Company going forward.

With that, I'll turn the call back to Bob.

While we face some considerable challenges, we're pleased with the quality of our business in the second quarter, especially considering that economic conditions around the world remain uneven.

In times like these, we appreciate the diversification in our business.

It's reassuring that each of our brands, each of our regions and each of our sales channels are growing.

We can now finally turn the page on a challenging first half of the year that included a number of unknown headwinds that particularly affected our gross margin.

We expect the second half of fiscal 2012 will compare favorably to last year as we anniversary higher input costs that we began to see in Q3 of 2011, and as we begin to deliver goods for our highly anticipated back-to-school season, particularly for DC.

We also expect to reduce inventory levels in the second half as we anticipate a successful fall season and largely conclude the clearance activities we identified a quarter ago.

Thanks again for participating in our call this afternoon.

Operator, that concludes our prepared comments.

We're now ready for the question-and-answer session.

Furthermore, as we start this call, please refer to the statement regarding forward-looking statements incorporated in our press release issued yesterday, and please note that the contents of our conference call this morning are covered by those statements.

I will now turn the call over to Brian Hanson.

Thanks Jack, and good morning, everyone.

First I'd like to spend some time discussing the overall market, and then I'll get more into specific on our 2011 accomplishments.

We covered some of this material in our December call, but I think it helps investors understand how we're thinking about our business both for 2012 and the longer term.

Looking at commodity prices, we expect oil prices to remain in the current trading range of $80 to $100 per barrel for 2012.

The world has approximately 2% spare capacity, which is extremely thin when considering the turmoil in North Africa, the Middle East, and Iran.

In addition, the aggregate natural decline of the large oil reserves around the world is approximately 10%, and has been slowed to 5% to 6% thanks to new technologies designed to extend reservoir life.

Reinvestment will need to increase just to offset the rate of actual decline, without taking into account growth in emerging economies such as India and China.

With oil production at approximately 85 million barrels per day, we're looking at the need to discover and bring on line approximately 5 million additional barrels a day just to keep pace.

And finally, when we consider the social cost to maintain stability in places like North Africa and the Middle East, it appears that $80 per barrel is a required floor price, which has gone up approximately $20 per barrel over the last few years.

Therefore, we're assuming that oil prices will remain at levels necessary to support continued frontier exploration in deep water, the arctic, and other hard-to-reach places.

Looking at natural gas, the precipitous drop in prices in North America over the last several quarters is clearly an issue that is likely to give pause in the near term to the way capital spending is allocated in North America.

We're seeing this in most North American E&amp;P earnings releases this past quarter.

This could slow our data library sales of our North American ResSCANS this year, as two of our three programs are concentrated in the Marcellus, which is predominantly a gas play.

The good news is, our Geoventures Business is a global portfolio, so we should be well-positioned to fill any softness in North American data library sales.

For example, this year we have solid programs in both the equatorial margin offshore Brazil, and in anticipation of their next licensing round; and are actively shooting a land program in Poland.

In the marine space we expect seismic spending by oil companies to increase 8% to 11% in 2012.

The seismic fleet is projected to continue to grow approximately half a dozen vessels this year, with four being high-end 3D.

As the total number of active vessels has grown substantially over the years, our marine group now enjoys a healthy and growing repair and replacement business, which provides a stable revenue and earnings stream.

We also expect both streamer count and length to continue to increase going forward, and we're observing a move towards higher-end 12 to 14 streamer vessels.

We are starting to see capacity tightening in the marine-towed streamer sector, and anticipate the day rates may start increasing in the back half of 2012.

In addition, seabed is a nice growth market.

In the past five years, total seabed spending has increased 150%, from $420 million in 2006 to $1.4 billion in 2011.

We are seeing increased ocean-bottom cable activity for 3D and 4D in the North Sea, West Africa, and the Middle East.

The seabed market has been driven by the need for higher resolution imaging, to better characterize reservoir, an area where recording the full wave field brings significant advantages.

Today we believe that Ion is the leading provider of full wave processing, and we expect this to continue to be one of the growth engines in our processing business.

In addition, efficiencies are being driven by new generation or next generation ocean bottom systems, which include more productive cable systems and nodes.

We believe that Ion is well positioned to take advantage of these current technology trends, with our version of a next-generation integrated platform for towed streamer, and a new generation ocean bottom cabled system.

The land seismic equipment market remained slow through 2011, as the events in the Middle East and North Africa this past year forced many crews to shut down.

We currently estimate that one-third of global land crews remain stacked, with many of those located in Russia, China, and the troubled areas in North Africa and the Middle East, such as Libya.

Land has still not made a full recovery, but very large contracts are being negotiated in the Middle East and North Africa.

Unless additional turmoil breaks out, it is expected that activity in those regions will increase in 2012.

In summary, our market outlook is as follows.

We believe that we are in an expanding exploration cycle driven by the need to meet growing international energy demand, which bodes well for the geophysical and seismic industry.

Globally, shell exploration of production should continue to grow its share in the energy mix, which creates significant opportunities for oil and gas service and technology companies.

In addition, we believe that frontier exploration is where much of the E&amp;P spend will be aimed, including the arctic.

Now more specific to Ion, as we indicated in our December call we're concentrating our focus on four key areas.

First, challenging environments, such as shooting seismic in the arctic -- we have developed a leading reputation for performing seismic surveys in the arctic, including programs in the US Beaufort and Canadian Chuckchi Seas, and offshore Greenland.

The second area is in complex and hard-to-image geologies.

For example, the deep water subsurface salt in the Gulf of Mexico, West Africa, and Brazil.

Our data processing group is a leader in depth imaging, including reverse time migration, and we expect our technologies to represent significant opportunities for Ion.

The third segment is unconventional reservoirs.

Over the years we have gained significant experience in China, where our technology has been successful in unravelling deep fracture tight gas sands.

We are currently developing our offering in the North American oil and gas shale place, with a solid start in 2011, where we spent approximately one-third of our Geoventures capital expenditures.

Our goal is to have a highly differentiated shale offering, which we call ResSCANS, centered around unique measurements, such as recording the full wave field, and also proprietary processing and reservoir characterization services.

We are well positioned to participate as the play migrates to other parts of the world, with Poland being our next spot.

The fourth segment is based on exploration, which is our legacy multi-client business.

Frontier exploration starts with a regional understanding of the geology, and that is where our BasinSPANS have been so successful.

This business started in 2003 with our GulfSPAN in the Gulf of Mexico, and has grown over the last several years to an extremely robust data library that covers virtually all of the frontier basins of the world, including such hot spots as East and West Africa and Brazil.

We expect the BasinSPAN Business to continue to be a significant revenue producer going forward, and recently announced the addition to our data library of another 8,000 kilometers of data shot on the Equatorial Margin offshore Brazil.

Specific to 2011, I'm pleased to report that we had a solid fourth quarter and a good year.

As we had anticipated and previously communicated, we saw our business build as we closed out the year.

Our system segment revenues increased 34% over prior year, driven by strong towed stream and other main equipment sales, including recognition of the 12-streamer systems sold to BGP.

Our marine business saw 40% year-over-year revenue growth.

Our concept systems navigational software business experienced another solid year, aided by subscription model.

We continue to invest in R&amp;D to focus on new integrated streamer, seabed and navigational acquisition technologies.

Our Solutions Business comprised of our new ventures, data library, and data processing Businesses, saw continued improvements in 2011, despite a slight year-over-year decline in revenues, primarily due to lower data processing revenues.

It has been a transformational year for our new ventures Business, increasing our customer count by 33%, our highest count ever.

The Solutions Business delivered robust full-year revenues of $263 million, and our multi-client Business achieved a milestone $1 billion of sales since its inception.

We made significant progress in acquiring 3D multi-client seismic in the Marcellus Shale via our new ResSCANS, and we have made further inroads with our marine multi-client BasinSPAN projects in the arctic, Brazil, and in East and West Africa.

Since 2003, we have delivered over 300,000 linear kilometers of data, and we ended 2011 with record Solutions backlog for both data processing and new venture Businesses.

Our library revenues have been solid and our level of multi-client investment has never been greater, with a record investment of $144 million in 2011.

Our data processing business is almost back to pre-Macondo levels, and continues to see sequential improvements each quarter, including improving Gulf of Mexico trends.

We recently signed the biggest single data processing contract award in our history, with PEMEX, and we believe we now have a market leadership position in full wave land and OBC processing and interpretation.

And on a preliminary basis, INOVA is expected to report its first profitable quarter since the joint venture was formed, and we continue to expect them to be breakeven for 2012.

I will now turn the call over to Greg Heinlein, who joined us in November as our CFO.

Greg brings to ION a proven track record of building and leading the financial operations of global, public and private companies across a number of industries, including life sciences, energy, semiconductors and chemicals.

He will now cover the financial results in more detail.

Thank you, Brian.

Good morning, everyone.

Regarding the fourth quarter, Ion delivered $0.15 of diluted earnings per share, on net income of $23 million, excluding special items, as the strong performance by our Systems segment and another steady performance by our Software segment offset lower revenues from our Solutions segment.

System segment fourth quarter revenues of $67 million improved 58% over the prior year period, driven by continued strong demand for towed streamer and other marine products.

Our Solutions multi-client business delivered fourth quarter revenues of $83 million, down 22% from the same period last year.

Our Software segment delivered $9 million of fourth quarter revenues, consistent with same prior year period, due to the strength of its subscription-based model.

We also achieved the 51st ORCA Software installation during the fourth quarter.

With that overview, let's take a look at full year revenues, followed by an in-depth look at each of our segments.

Excluding our legacy land business, revenues increased 6% to $455 million for 2011, compared to $428 million in 2010.

System segment revenues increased 34% over the prior period, with strong demand for towed streamer and other marine products.

Software segment revenues were flat in local currency, and increased 4% in US dollar terms.

Solutions segment revenues decreased 5%, primarily due to lower data processing revenues, and more to come on that later.

Systems segment revenues increased 34% to $153 million in 2011, compared to $114 million for the prior year.

This increase was primarily due to increased sales of our towed streamer equipment and other marine products.

One highlight for the Systems segment this year was the recognition of revenue from the BGP 12-Streamer System in the fourth quarter.

Our Systems segment continues to maintain its R&amp;D spend, as we invest in the next generation seabed and towed streamer technologies.

Our sensor geophone Business delivered its best quarter of the year, with fourth quarter revenues exceeding the combined revenues for the previous three quarters.

The land seismic Business has been slow to recover from the negative impact of geopolitical events in North Africa and the Middle East.

However, we believe that this uptick in geophone string sales in the fourth quarter indicates healing in the land seismic market.

This improvement, together with our migration to low-cost manufacturing, should set the stage for improved results from our sensor geophone business in 2012.

Our Solutions multi-client business delivered another solid performance, with full-year revenues of $263 million compared to $277 million last year.

This 5% decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to the lagging data processing revenues after the Macondo oil spill, partially offset by robust new venture revenues.

This was the first decline in our data processing Business after several years of year-over-year growth, and represented an approximate $0.12 negative pre-tax impact from the prior year.

During the fourth quarter, the Gulf of Mexico sales pipeline increased sequentially, in line with similar increases for the previous two years.

While activity in the Gulf of Mexico continues to show signs of improvement, we also remain focussed on international growth with data processing centers around the world.

Our Solutions backlog ended the year at $134 million, which significantly exceeds the historical range of $80 million to $100 million.

We believe this record level of backlog for our Solutions business, provides an indication of the strength of our sales pipeline, and should positively impact our Solutions revenues as we move into 2012.

This next slide illustrates the relationship between our Solutions backlog and the associated data processing and new venture revenues.

Our solutions backlog includes both data processing work that has been contracted by our data processing business, and new venture activity of our Geoventures group that has been underwritten.

As you would expect, there has typically been a one- to two-quarter lag between when data processing work is contracted, and when the processing occurs, triggering revenue recognition.

Similarly, there has been a lag between when new venture projects are underwritten, and when the seismic data is acquired, which is when the majority of new venture revenues are recognized.

Over the past three years, on average, backlog levels have tended to hover at 2.3 times the associated revenues.

As you can see, periods of backlog growth have usually preceded increases in revenues.

While the length of time it takes to convert the backlog into revenue varies, we believe that the growth of our solutions backlog is a good indication of future revenue growth.

In particular, we believe our record level of backlog at the end of 2011, which was predominantly due to new data processing contracts, bodes well for our data processing group, which we expect to see return to its normal historical growth rates during 2012.

This next slide takes a closer look at the relationship between our investment and our multi-client data library, and the associated new venture in data library revenues from our multi-client business.

As this slide illustrates, the level of new venture revenues has been consistently correlated to the annual level of new multi-client investment, with revenues from data library sales rising above and beyond this investment level.

As you can see from the size of our 2011 investment, we believe that our opportunities are strong, reflecting continued confidence that 2012 will be another good year.

Similar to the annual trend, this slide illustrates how the relationship between multi-client revenues and investments has been evident by quarter on average.

It's important to point out that our multi-client investment reached record levels this year, with a significant portion of this investment made during the fourth quarter.

As you can see, the fourth quarter investment for 2011 significantly outpaced the historical fourth quarter average, predominantly due to our ResSCANS programs and continued multiple base and span opportunities.

Historically, our third quarter has enjoyed the highest average multi-client investment, attributable to our BasinSPAN work in the arctic, where the season for acquiring seismic data generally occurs from July to September due to ice conditions.

With increasing new venture activity on land, including the completion of our first ResSCAN in the Marcellus Shale play in the fourth quarter, we should now be able to take advantage of new venture acquisition opportunities after we are timed out in the arctic.

As we continue to diversify our BasinSPAN multi-client projects regionally, and grow the land ResSCANS component of the multi-client business, we believe we will experience a more even distribution of multi-client revenues throughout the year.

In fact, we believe our significant investment in our new venture projects in the fourth quarter, which is continuing into the first quarter, will enable us to generate approximately 25% of annual results in the first half of the year.

Software segment full year revenues remain consistent at GBP24 million compared to 2010, as steady subscription sales of ORCA Software continue to demonstrate consistent demand for concept systems command and control software platforms, with approximately 41% of the total market share.

Moving now to a couple of special items, our fourth quarter results were impacted by three pre-tax adjustments.

The first item relates to a $7.7 million charge, representing our 49% share of a write-down of excess inventory by INOVA Geophysical.

This charge reflects an adjustment to inventory values for older products, given INOVA's launch of Hawk, and a new version of FireFly.

The second item is a $2.9 million restructuring, as we moved our geophone manufacturing operations from the Netherlands to lower-cost centers in Asia.

The last item is a $1.3 million impairment of one of Ion's investments.

Excluding these special items, fourth quarter net income increased by $11.2 million over the fourth quarter 2010, and diluted earnings per share increased by $0.07.

Moving on to the balance sheet, the asset side of our balance sheet continues to demonstrate our asset-light strategy, with our most significant investments in working capital and oil company-funded multi-client projects, resulting in a data library with a net book value of $176 million.

Total cash on hand was approximately $70 million, which was $35 million less than our total outstanding debt balance of $105 million.

At the end of the fourth quarter we had $170 million of liquidity, comprised of $70 million of cash and $100 million of undrawn credit on our revolving credit facility.

Operating cash flows, including cash flows from working capital, were consistent with the prior year.

However, given our investment of $144 million in our multi-client data libraries, free cash flow is negative for 2011, and we expect to monetize these investments in 2012.

Now turning to INOVA, full year revenues increased approximately 39% over the same period of last year, with the leanest inventory levels of the year, and a credit line capacity of $27 million to support 2012 growth.

INOVA estimates fourth quarter revenues to be in the range of approximately $58 million to $62 million, with operating income of approximately $5 million to $8 million.

As we previously mentioned on our December outlook call, we expect INOVA full year results for 2012 to be breakeven.

Similar to last quarter, we would expect to book 49% of INOVA's estimated fourth quarter net income in our first quarter results.

INOVA's fourth quarter numbers are estimates, which we believe offer some visibility into the impact we expect the joint venture to have on our financial results.

However, these are not final audited numbers.

As mentioned last quarter, INOVA announced the launch of its next generation land seismic products last September, and field testing of these new products is progressing, paving the way for sales opportunities in 2012.

We believe these new and improved technologies will attract significant customer interest, because they are designed to deliver improved image quality through more productive delivery systems.

Meanwhile, INOVA experienced notable sales of its current technologies, such as vibrator trucks, various cabled systems, and FireFly sales and rentals in the fourth quarter.

Finally, I will reiterate some of the key assumptions related to 2012 that we highlighted in our December outlook call.

It is not our intention to give guidance on revenue or earnings; however, I will speak to some of the more transparent elements of our Business.

We see 2012 as a year of growth across all of our Businesses.

In addition, with the increase in activity of Geoventure land projects, we expect our earnings to be less skewed to the back half of the year as compared to 2010 and 2011, as we anticipate approximately 25% more of our annual earnings to be in the front half of the year.

We believe the data processing business has almost recovered on a quarterly run rate basis from the decline in 2011, and will grow at normal historical levels.

2011 was a good year for the Geoventures group and we expect 2012 to be strong as well.

Multi-client investments, which highly correlate to new venture revenues, are expected to be in the range of $130 million to $150 million for 2012.

Data library revenues are difficult to predict, but our data library portfolio is more robust than it has ever been, and all indications are that oil company CapEx budgets are rising from 2011 levels, which is a good indicator of our future data library sales.

For the marine Business, we expect to sell at least two large-ticket systems, either towed streamer or OBC, in 2012, in addition to a growing repair and replacement business.

During 2012 we would expect operating expenses to remain flat as a percentage of revenue, interest expense to be in the $4 million to $7 million range, and our effective tax rate to be between 22% and 25%.

In summary, we are pleased with the results of the fourth quarter and the momentum this represents as we head into 2012.

We would like to thank our customers for their continued faith and dedication to Ion, and our employees who make the difference as we compete in the marketplace everyday.

And with that we'll open up the call for questions.

My name is Christi and I will be your conference facilitator today.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Roxio conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer period.

If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star, then the number 1 on your telephone keypad.

If you would like to withdraw your question, press the pound key.

Thank you, Jennifer Jorman.

You may begin your conference.

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today.

This call is also being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed on Roxio's investor relations website at investor.roxio.com.

With me on today's call are Chris Gorog, Roxio's president and chief executive officer, Elliot Carpenter, chief financial officer, and Tom Shea, chief operating officer.

We would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, Roxio's management will make forward-looking statements, including predictions and estimates.

These statements, including statements regarding future revenue and income, product development, and the growth of various segments of the digital media industry involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

Actual results may differ materially from any future performance suggested in the company's forward-looking statements.

We refer you to the company's Form 10-K for the year ended March 31st, 2001, and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31 - March 31st, 2002 on file with the SEC for important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

We expressly disclaim any obligation to update this forward-looking information.

And now I'd like it turn the call over to Chris Gorog.

Hello, and thank you for joining us on the call on such short notice.

I'm going to give you a very brief overview of what's happening in the quarter.

Then we'll be happy to take any questions you may have.

We issued a press release this afternoon after the market closed providing preliminary results for the first quarter ending June 30.

We now expect revenues to be approximately 31 million, and pro forma net income to be approximately 2 cents.

The primary factor behind our change in guidance, which may come as little surprise given the number of recent announcements, is the greater than expected weakness in PC and PC-related hardware and software.

This is impacting our business in the form of lower OEM revenues overall, as well as softer than expected retail sales.

In terms of the breakdown by channel, we expect approximately 55% to come from our retail partners, approximately 32% to come from OEM licensing royalties, and approximately 13% from our direct business, which includes OEM upgrades and direct upgrades to our end user.

On the OEM side, over the last week as we began to see royalty reports for the month of May, it became clear that OEM shipments were weaker than anticipated.

Retail sales have also been weaker than expected, particularly in Europe, and we expect our European retail business to be down over 20% for the quarter.

Our direct business appears to be reflecting the overall decline in consumer spending as well.

While it's too early to tell the extent to which these conditions may continue into our second quarter, market indicators now suggest that the consumer PC and software sectors will be less robust in the near term than previously anticipated.

We will continue to analyze carefully the overall health of the PC and PC software segments, and will continue to manage our costs and expenses conservatively.

We'll be providing more information on our earnings call on July 24th, but at this point we think it's prudent to maintain the assumptions that fiscal Q2 should be roughly flat with what we see in our first fiscal quarter.

We are very excited about our upcoming product releases planned for the balance of our fiscal year.

Our new Edition of Easy CD Creator will be released with highly integrated CD and DVD recording.

We will release a major revision of our top-selling Photo Suite, the first such revision in over two years, a new Edition of Video Wave that provides automatic editing and more robust DVD authoring capabilities, as well as new releases of our Toast CD/DVD recording product.

While we remain cautious, given the overall state of the economy, and its effect on the PC software sector, we are optimistic that we will see a very good reception to our upcoming releases.

Taking a longer-term view, we are pleased overall with the way the company has performed throughout a prolonged challenging environment for the PC industry and the economy in general.

While Roxio is not immune to the economic downturn, we are more confident than ever in our competitive position and the prospects for future growth in the digital media sector.

In the short term, we will keep a tight rein on expenses while continuing to invest in the important growth catalyst coming later this fiscal year, and we feel confident that this will lead to solid sequential growth in the second half of our fiscal year.

Thank you for your interest and attention, and I'll now open up the call to your questions.

Good morning, I will be your conference operator today.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter 2009 earnings release conference call for Questar Corporation.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.

After the speakers' remarks there will be a question and answer session.

(Operator Instructions)
 At this time I will turn the conference over to Mr. Keith O. Rattie, the Chairman, President and CEO.

Sir, you may begin your conference.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Questar Corp. second quarter 2009 conference call.

We have a lot of ground to cover this morning.

We are going to try to add some color to our earnings release yesterday.

We will be commenting on our outlook for the rest of 2009 and then we'll discuss our latest well results in our Haynesville shale play.

Followed by brief updates on our Pinedale Anticline, Anadarko Basin Woodford shale, or Cana, shale play, Granite Wash and the Bakken oil play.

We will be referring to five new slides that we posted under the investor's tab at our Web site, Questar.com.

In addition to Chuck Stanley and Ron Jibson we are pleased to have two new members of the Questar management team here today.

After my remarks, Richard Doleshek, our new CFO, will make a few comments about the quarter.

Also Sam Brothwell, no stranger to many of you, finds himself sitting on this side of the call as our new Vice President of Corporate Planning and Investor Relations.

So let's cover the quarter.

Natural gas prices as everyone knows are down about 75% from the peak in July 2008.

And that's clearly having an impact on our bottom line.

But the hedging discipline we've had in place for many years in Questar E&amp;P plus the stable cash flow we get from our other businesses have to a large extent protected 2009 cash flow.

Note that we've inserted a new table in our earnings release.

EBITDA per reporting segment.

Questar consolidated EBITDA was $805 million in the first half of 2009.

That's down just 4% from the first half of '08 despite the steep drop in commodity prices.

Market Resources alone generated $642 million EBITDA in the first half.

And that's down just 5% from the year ago period.

And of that Questar E&amp;P generated $477 million of the EBITDA in the first half of '09, down just 5% from a year ago.

Story here, cash flow hedges added $309 million to Questar E&amp;P revenues in the first half of 2009.

As we discussed in our last call at year end 2008 and again at the end of the first quarter of 2009, Questar E&amp;P debooked previously booked proved undeveloped reserves due to sharply lower prices.

Lower reserves in the denominator combined with increased volumes from our higher-cost pools in the Mid-Continent to drive Questar E&amp;P DD&amp;A rate higher and thus DD&amp;A expense was up $98 million in the first half of this year.

As of successful efforts Company, Questar E&amp;P has not taken the ceiling test write downs that many of our full cost peers have reported in recent quarters.

Instead we carry the burden of our now higher DD&amp;A rate until prices improve and we bring those reserves back on our books.

If there is some confusion about that, please ask us in Q&amp;A to clarify it.

Questar E&amp;P first half 2009 net income was also reduced by $102 million from mark-to-market non-cash charges on basis hedges which we also discussed in our last call.

Note from the table at the end of our release that we reduced our exposure to low natural gas prices in 2010 and '11 by hedging additional production in those years.

We put these hedges in place by converting basis swaps primarily in the Rockies to FAS 133 qualified cash flow hedges.

This should reduce the volatility in Questar E&amp;P reported earnings caused by mark-to-market swings in the end of the quarter value of the basis swaps.

Operations Questar E&amp;P grew production 13% to 90.3 billion cubic feet equivalent in the first six months of 2009 compared to a year ago.

And that's despite significant voluntary production curtailments.

Voluntary curtailments hurt our growth comps but we improved returns on capital by deferring some of our unhedged production until natural gas prices improve.

Note also that 46% of Questar E&amp;P second quarter production came from the Mid-Continent.

Now, some investors still think of Questar as primarily a Rockies producer but that's not the case anymore.

In 2009 we are allocating 40% of Questar E&amp;P's $860 million CapEx budget to our higher margin Haynesville shale play and that's about the same as we are allocating to our Pinedale Anticline play in the Rockies.

Haynesville and Pinedale are of course two of the most economic natural gas plays in the U.S. and we are allocating much of the remaining 20% of Questar E&amp;P's budget to our promising Woodford shale play in Western Oklahoma as I will discuss in a moment we will put a rig back to work in our Bakken oil play.

All of these plays earned risk returns well above our cost to capital on the current forward curve.

We are also evaluating horizontal drilling in the Granite Wash formation in the Texas Panhandle where Questar E&amp;P has significant acreage.

A little more on that in a moment.

Now when natural gas prices were higher, investors tended to focus solely on Questar E&amp;P and overlook contribution from our other businesses.

But in a year like 2009 the contribution we get from the rest of Questar becomes a source of competitive advantage.

The net income and cash flows from these businesses are relatively insensitive to commodity prices and combined the rest of Questar is on track to generate about $225 million of net income and nearly $700 million in EBITDA in 2009.

Of course, supporting our investment grade credit ratings, bolstering liquidity and thus enhancing our ability to fund growth in our E&amp;P core.

Yesterday, if you saw the release, we raised the lower end of our 2009 EPS guidance and affirmed our previous production guidance.

Note that we now expect Questar 2009 net income to range from $2.35 to $2.45 per diluted share.

That's up from $2.30 on the low end to $2.45 per diluted share as cited in our last call.

As a reminder when we give EPS guidance we exclude mark-to-market gains and losses on basis hedges and gains and losses on asset sales.

We expect Questar E&amp;P 2009 production to range from 180 billion to 186 billion cubic feet equivalent and that's unchanged from our prior guidance, up 5 to 9% from 2008 and again this is despite voluntary curtailments and our decision to defer some well completions due to weak near term prices and you may want to ask Chuck about that when we get to Q&amp;A.

We put a table in the earnings release that summarizes other key assumptions in our guidance.

Let me turn now to operations starting in the Mid-Continent with the Haynesville shale.

Note that we currently have six Questar operated-rigs in Northwest Louisiana.

Four currently drilling Haynesville wells, one drilling a horizontal Cotton Valley well and one drilling a vertical Cotton Valley Hosston well.

Year to date 2009 we now have a working interest in 12 new Haynesville shale producing wells, seven of which are Questar operated, five nonoperating.

We expect to drill or participate in 35 Haynesville shale horizontal wells in 2009.

Please note that we've drilled and turned four Questar E&amp;P operated Haynesville wells to sale since our last call.

The new completions are shown on slide three with red outlines around the callout boxes.

Please note that our latest Questar operated well, our 88% working interest Sustainable Forest 29H well, may be the strongest yet.

We turned it to sales about three weeks ago at an initial 24 hour average rate of 25 million cubic feet per day.

And please note that the rates that we are reporting are actual sales rates, not calculated rates as some operators have reported.

Also note that we drilled and completed this well at a cost of just over $9 million.

To the west on our Thorn Lake acreage we turned our 93% working interest Rex Young well to sales in June at an initial 24 hour average rate of over 25 million cubic feet a day.

Both of these 24 hour rates were through 28/64-inch chokes with flowing pressures over 7,500 pounds.

These two wells you will note are among the strongest wells both drilled by any operator in the play to date further confirming that our acreage is in the sweet spot of the Haynesville play.

Please note that due to current low prices we have choked each of these wells back to rates of around 10 million cubic feet per day after initial flow back and recovery of some of the frac fluid.

The other two Questar-operated Haynesville wells, the Hutchinson and Harper wells shown on the slides, are also very strong wells both are flowing to sales but we have a string of coil tubing stuck in the Harper well which we will fish out later after the pressure declines and on the Hutchinson well we experimented with a new frac design and that's negatively affected the initial rate.

Our Haynesville team is working to add to our already strong acreage position in the core of the play.

Please note that we've recently entered into a multi-well farm-in option agreement in the acreage shown in blue on slides two and three.

In lieu of upfront cash Questar E&amp;P has the continuing option to drill to earn approximately 3,000 net acres.

We are currently drilling ahead on the first earning well.

I should note that we are also working other deals to add to our Haynesville acreage position.

Now we get questions from investors about pipeline takeaway capacity out of the Haynesville area.

So let me give you an update on that.

Questar E&amp;P currently holds about 65 million cubic feet day of firm capacity with over 300 million cubic feet a day of additional firm capacity under contract to begin deliveries in several tranches beginning in 2010.

We are also investing in new gathering and treating infrastructure to move gas from the wells to the interstate pipes where we hold the firm capacity.

Moving to the Western Mid-Continent, as was the case in the first quarter we are operating one rig in the promising Anadarko Woodford Cana shale play.

We currently have a working interest in 35 producing wells, four of those are Questar operated.

And well performance thus far is consistent with the EUR assumptions summarized on slide four.

Now as those who follow our story know, until the downturn we were allocating capital to a multi-rig drilling program, drilling vertical wells in our Granite Wash Atoka play in the Texas Panhandle.

Given the recent success reported by other operators, we are now evaluating horizontal drilling on our 23,000 net acres and Chuck can give you more color on that when we get to Q&amp;A.

Let's move to Pinedale we now have five rigs operating at Pinedale, that's two less than our last call and four less than a year ago.

Recall that when we came out of the winter this year we came out with 56 wells drilled and cased, we've now completed and turned 50 of these wells to sales.

Our Pinedale team continues to drive hard on productivity improvement.

In 2009 to date we've averaged about $5.2 million to drill, complete and connect new wells at Pinedale.

That's down over 17% from a peak of $6.3 million in 2008 and we expect it to continue to decline.

We've averaged 23 days from spud to total depth in 2009.

And we've drilled 100% of our 2009 wells in less than 30 days.

In 2009 we've drilled one out of every five wells from spud to TD in less than 20 days.

And please keep in mind that Questar operates on the northern plunge of the Anticline so our wells are roughly 1,000 feet deeper than wells drilled by other Pinedale operators to the south.

At the pace that we are on even with five Questar operated rigs we expect to drill and case about 100 wells in 2009.

Please note however that due to current market conditions we have decided to defer completions on about 20 of these wells.

Let me give you a quick update on our Bakken oil play in the Williston Basin North Dakota, recall that we drilled and turned our first Questar E&amp;P operated Bakken oil well to sales in January at an initial rate of 960 barrels of oil equivalent per day.

Overall Questar E&amp;P now has a working interest in 23 wells on our 80,000 net acres in the Bakken play.

The good news, the Bakken play appears to be converging on our core acreage block on the Fort Berthoud Indian reservation.

Other operators have reported initial rates as high as 1,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day on wells drilled near our core block shown in yellow on slide five.

By the end of this month we expect to have three new well permits in hand with several more in progress and the locations on these are indicated with a blue diamond on the slide.

Therefore we plan to spud our second Questar operated well in August and we hope to keep the rig drilling through the rest of this year and on into 2010.

Based on the well cost and EUR assumptions summarized on the slide, our planned Bakken oil wells generate solid returns at current oil prices.

I am going to quickly run through our other businesses.

Wexpro our second E&amp;P Company has grown its investment base 19% over the last 12 months to $411 million at the end of the second quarter.

We forecast that Wexpro will end the year with an investment base of about $440 million, that's unchanged from our last call.

A reminder under the now 28-year-old Wexpro agreement, Wexpro earns a 19 to 20% after tax unlevered return on that net investment base.

Gas management our Rockies mid-stream business reported a 36% decline in net income in the first half of 2009 compared to the same period a year ago.

That's due primarily to lower processing margin and higher depreciation expense.

Second quarter gathering margins for our mid-stream company were about flat with a year ago.

Methane and propane prices and thus processing margins have improved in the last three months but remain well below the record levels we saw in the second and third quarters of 2008.

I should note this morning that our mid-stream team has secured a long-term contract with a major producer to build a 150 million cubic foot per day deep cut cryogenic processing plant adjacent to our existing stage coach plant in the Uinta Basin.

We expect to put this new plant in service in late 2010.

Turning quickly to our regulated business, Questar Pipeline remains on track.

With two important expansion projects on our Overthrust Pipeline system.

This year we are installing 32,000-horsepower of new and compression to increase firm capacity on Overthrust from Opal to Wamsutter, Wyoming, by 300 million cubic feet a day.

Next year we will construct a 42 mile, 36-inch bi-directional loop of Overthrust to deliver gas into El Paso's Ruby Pipeline.

Both of these projects are underwritten by long-term contracts.

Finally, our utility Questar gas is on track to earn its allowed return in 2009.

Our utility's closing in on 900,000 homes and businesses served and it's also doing its part to demonstrate that lower carbon American produced natural gas as a clean low cost alternative to gasoline refined from foreign oil in America's cars and trucks.

With gasoline prices trending back up toward $3 per gallon CNG demand is once again surging and to meet this demand we are expanding several of our 19 CNG filling stations in Utah.

Before we go to Q&amp;A, I'm pleased to invite Richard Doleshek our CFO to make a few comments.

Thank you, Keith.

First of all I would like to say how delighted I am to be at Questar.

This is a great company with wonderful assets and people and it really is a terrific opportunity for me.

As Keith mentioned, given the dramatic fall on commodity prices over the last 12 months, the company's results for the second quarter and first half of the year are pretty impressive.

EBITDA as we define it was $370 million for the quarter, $805 million for the first six months, down only 11% and 4% respectively from the record levels in the previous year's corresponding periods.

Factors driving the six month EBITDA figure were a 13% increase in production compared to last year a 63% decline in field level prices that were offset by $309 million of revenues from our hedges and that's about $3.42 per MCFE and 11% decline in combined operating maintenance production tax expense.

Our reported capital spending for the first half of the year was $703 million compared with full year current CapEx number of $1.3 billion when you take into consideration $139 million of carry over from 2008 our capital spending is on track for the year.

In terms of liquidity at the corporate level we renewed $275 million of CP backup lines that matured on 6/30 and added an additional $50 million commitment so on July 1 our committed lines to the corporate level were $405 million.

I think the commercial banking sector has gotten healthier through 2009 and we really appreciate the support of our existing and new banks.

At the end of the quarter there were no outstandings under those CP backup lines and we had $36 million of commercial paper issued at an average rate of less than 0.5% interest.

On the QMR level at June 30 we had $500 million outstanding under the $800 million revolver on July 15 we paid down $25 million of that revolver.

During the second quarter there was virtually no change in our indebtedness reflecting us living inside internal cash flow for the period.

In summary, from an EBITDA perspective the quarter and first six months were pretty good, from a net income perspective aside from lower commodity prices, non-cash charges, primarily increased DD&amp;A in the mark-to-market losses on the non-133 hedges drove our quarter and six month numbers down from a year ago.

Our balance sheet remains strong.

Our aggregate liquidity from committed bank lines is approximately $700 million and projected cash flows supported by robust hedging program for the rest of the year support our capital spending program for the rest of the year.

With that I will turn it back to Keith for closing comments.

Let me just summarize we all know these are tough times for the natural gas industry and obviously for Questar.

But we continue to weather the storm.

Questar E&amp;P earnings are down significantly from the boom times of 2008, but as Richard has just summarized cash flow and thus our balance sheet remains strong.

We are on track to grow production 5 to 9% this year despite sharp cuts in capital spending and despite significant voluntary curtailments.

As I summarize we are allocating most of our E&amp;P capital to two of the most economic plays in the country, the Haynesville shale, the Pinedale Anticline, and we hope to confirm with the drill bit that we're also at the heart of the Bakken oil play in the Williston Basin.

We're satisfied with our results to date in the Cana shale play and we're evaluating horizontal drilling on our Granite Wash acreage in the Texas Panhandle.

No one knows when the U.S. natural gas market is going to turn up but it will and when it does we intend to capitalize on this Company's high quality assets both physical and human.

With that, operator, please open up the lines for questions.

Good day and welcome to LMI Aerospace's first-quarter 2010 earnings conference call.

Today's call is being recorded.

This call includes forward-looking statements related to LMI Aerospace's outlook for 2010 which are based on the current management expectations.

Such forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of LMI Aerospace.

Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements as a result of, among other things, the factors detailed from time to time in LMI Aerospace's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Please refer to the risk factors contained in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and any risk factors set forth in our other subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Saks, Chief Executive Officer.

Thank you, Molina.

We welcome all of you joining our conference call today.

I am Ron Saks, CEO of LMI, and with me is Ed Dickinson, our Chief Financial Officer.

Ryan Bogan, President of our D3 Technologies division is concluding a scheduled customer meeting and may be available to join us later.

A few comments from me and then I am going to ask Ed to go through the accounting data as we are -- we had a fairly lengthy press release that we issued earlier today.

As LMI entered 2009 we focused attention on short-term actions to counter the global economic turmoil that threatened the survivability of companies around the world.

We have reduced inventories, costs, and capital expenditures, and successfully managed our cash flow so that we could stay focused on our long-term future.

In the short term our operating results for the first quarter of 2010 once again reflect the continuing efforts of our plants and engineering offices to eliminate waste, become more efficient, and distinguish themselves with constantly improving on-time delivery and a high quality of services and products.

The operations and execution plans put in place during the first quarter of this year at both Engineering Services and Manufacturing are driving performance with emphasis on staffing efficiency, on-time delivery, ever-higher quality metrics, emphasis on front-end planning, and targeted cash generation.

In addition, our negotiations with several of our key customers resulted in increasing our work statement in return for lower prices causing an increasing shift of commodity work to our Mexicali facility while maintaining current revenue levels at our US facilities.

That new work largely is scheduled to commence in 2011 and thereafter.

In 2010 we are maintaining our focus on customers and cash and believe we are in a good position to invest in new design build programs as well as complementary acquisitions.

As we add critical mass through organic and acquisition growth our customers will have growing confidence that they can truly partner with us on large, complex design build programs and that continues to be our primary business development focus.

I will return to discuss our growing customer relationships and plans to expand our product offerings.

In the meantime, Ed, why don't you go ahead?

I would be glad to.

Good morning, everybody.

I will walk through the results of the first quarter and be happy to take any questions in the Q&amp;A session.

Just as an overall view it was a good quarter for LMI.

On a consolidated basis sales were $60.4 million, down from $64 million in the first quarter of 2009.

We had a tough sales comp quarter when looking at the first quarter of 2009.

I will break the comparison out during the segment discussion but suffice it to say both our segments were down.

We were pleased to see gross margins expand in the quarter reaching 23.8% of 100 basis points from the prior year, even with price reductions and higher healthcare costs in the quarter.

I will talk a bit more about that as we get into the segments as well.

Overall, we earned $0.34 a diluted share, up from $0.30 the prior year and I would just say overall we felt good about the solid performance on lower sales volumes.

Moving to Aerostructures we generated $41.2 million of sales, down from $43.3 million the prior year.

The first quarter of 2009 had some unusual items including $5.4 million of tooling revenue and a spike in Blackhawk revenues after heavy delivery deferrals in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Net sales of large commercial aircraft were $18.5 million, up from $14.7 million the prior year.

The weakness in the prior year was due to the residual affects of the Boeing IAM strike.

Our 767 wing mod program generated $5.5 million of revenue in the current quarter versus $5 million in the prior year.

On production models we saw sales increase on all the key models for us with the 737 growing to $6 million in the quarter, up from $4.7 million the prior year; 747 generated $4.4 million, up from $3.1 million; and the 777 provided $1.5 million, up from $1 million.

Growth on the 777 was primarily due to about $600,000 of tools on new work for that aircraft.

We expect the next two quarters to receive the benefit of the balance of those tools related to that new program of about $2.3 million.

Corporate and regional aircraft sales were $11.5 million, down from $15.9 million the prior year.

This market received the bulk of the tooling benefit I spoke of a few moments ago.

About $4.7 million of that tooling was related to the Gulfstream G250, G650, and Canadair Regional Jet.

When I exclude the tooling bubble from the prior year, sales for the market were $11.5 million compared to $11.2 million the prior year representing a boost in the Gulfstream large cabin sales.

These large cabin sales reached $10 million, up from $9 million the prior year, and were the highest level we have seen since late 2008, the last full quarter before Gulfstream announced production rate cuts which suggests that the inventory destocking with this customer is behind us.

This increase was partially offset by declines on Bombardier programs.

Net sales of military products were $9.3 million, down from $11.1 million the prior year.

As previously noted, Blackhawk revenues surged in the first quarter of last year as deferred deliveries from 2008 shipped.

Blackhawk revenue in the first quarter was $7.7 million, down from $8.6 million in the prior year.

Technology sales tripled, albeit from a very anemic level, reaching $600,000 consistent with our expectation for the modest recovery in this market in 2010.

Gross profit was $10.9 million for the segment or 26.4% of sales.

This percentage of sales was the highest we have seen since 2008.

The prior year was $11 million or 25.3% of sales.

Included in the quarter were some challenges including healthcare costs and price reductions to certain customers.

We run a self-insured pool that includes employees from both the Engineering Services and Aerostructures segment.

Aerostructures' manufacturing overhead received a period charge of approximately $300,000 in the quarter as claims have been running much higher than expected.

Additionally, we pushed through approximately $600,000 of price reductions in the quarter and still improved margins.

These reductions in price were negotiated in conjunction with new work awards that should impact future periods, primarily beginning in 2011.

Balancing our production levels with demand instead of reducing inventories has made our production facilities much more efficient and provided better coverage and fixed costs.

If I look at SG&amp;A, expenses were $6.2 million in the quarter, down from $6.5 million the prior year.

However, the prior year included approximately $0.5 million of charges related to the acquisition of In Tech and some lingering costs related to the winding down of the Technical Change Associates business that we sold.

Excluding the non-recurring prior-year items, the resulting increase was approximately $200,000 and it was primarily related to health insurance costs.

Also impacting the prior year were some restructuring costs, $362,000, that were carved out of SG&amp;A and you will see on the face of the income statement.

As I move to Engineering Services revenues were $19.2 million, down from $20.8 million the prior year.

As many of you know, we primarily sell labor hours in this segment as we have been reducing staffing levels as business opportunities dictate.

As noted in the release, staffing levels for this segment dropped from 392 employees at the end of the first quarter last year to 342 at the end of the current quarter.

Overtime is relatively stable between the two periods.

Sales of services for -- or engineering services for large commercial platforms were $6.5 million, down from $9.6 million the prior year.

The majority of this decline was due to the design maturity of the 747-8 with a minor amount coming from declining work on the 787.

Offsetting much of this decrease in large commercial aircraft was growth in military work; sales of $7.4 million in the quarter compared to $5.8 million in the prior year.

Growth was largely due to work on the CH-53.

Additionally, there was growth, though not nearly as material, on the JSF program and some decline on other Lockheed programs.

(inaudible) and regional programs generated $5 million in the current year compared to $4.9 million the prior year, although sales for this market seemed to be relatively flat.

There was significant mix [links] in the quarter when compared to the prior year.

The prior year was dominated by Gulfstream platforms and the current period is primarily a result of support for MJET and Bombardier.

Gross profit for the segment was $3.5 million, unchanged from the prior year but on lower revenues suggesting a stronger than expected 18.2% of sales in the current year.

The Engineering Services management team has done a very good job of managing headcount and costs during a challenging time.

As noted before, employment levels were down 50 people or about 13% yet sales were only down 8% resulting in a better yield per hour and higher gross margins.

Benefits from this allowed the segment to cover higher healthcare costs of approximately $140,000.

SG&amp;A for engineering services was $1.8 million, down from $2 million the prior year.

Reductions in temporary staffing, primarily in the information technology area, and lower stock compensation expense generated this decline and were partially offset by a higher allocation of corporate charges.

Interest costs were $227,000, down from $422,000.

Continued high levels of free cash flow have driven down borrowings and this combined with the low interest rate environment created the reduction.

Our effective income tax rate was unchanged at 36.5% but we do believe we may have some opportunity to decrease this rate in the future if the R&amp;D tax credits are renewed.

Again this quarter free cash flow was strong generating nearly $5 million.

Accounts receivable were up due to billing for tooling and high shipments in the month of March.

Accrued expenses on the cash flow statement reflect a source of cash of nearly $3 million primarily related to deferred revenue on the tooling bill in March for the 777 and accrued payroll due to the timing of our payrolls.

Our capital expenditures were $1.6 million, up from $875,000 the prior year as we continue to invest in various projects including our processing line in Mexicali and our product data management software.

As we have previously stated, we expect to spend approximately $8 million this year on CapEx.

All of this combined to reduce our revolving line of credit to $12 million at the end of the quarter.

Continue to see strong cash flow in April and early May with our revolver, net of cash, dropping as low as $4.5 million.

We billed a second milestone of our design build program in late April and expect to collect that in May.

If all goes as planned, we should be out of debt prior to our tax payments in June.

Turning our attention to guidance, we have seen many positive indicators from OEMs that should benefit our 2011 and 2012 revenues.

2010 sales look to be only slightly better than 2009.

As stated in the release, we brought down our 2010 revenue guidance for Aerostructures pointing to the movement of some military assemblies to another supplier oversees and delays in obtaining work statements that we have been trying to obtain for many months.

Partially offsetting the lower revenue models was an increase in both the top and the bottom of the gross margin range and our recent performance and acknowledging that our production levels had increased to meet demand instead of focusing our plants on reducing inventories.

Additionally, we plan to allocate approximately $500,000 more from Aero to Engineering Services; otherwise we did not change Engineering Services guidance.

Interest costs were reduced slightly with the positive cash flow outlook.

That is all I have for now and with that I will turn it back over to Ron.

During the first quarter we worked with some of our key customers to put long-term agreements into effect.

Aerostructures signed an LTA with Boeing Seattle extending a contract which was set to expire in 2011 out to 2016.

The contract covers legacy models primarily with some 747-8 and 777 work remaining through 2011.

We have just been awarded additional work on 748, 777, as well as legacy work and we will be discussing the addition of that work to our LTA at a later time.

We have also reached verbal agreement with two major customers, Sikorsky and Gulfstream.

We have several long-term agreements with Sikorsky, two of which expired at the end of 2009.

We agreed in the quarter to extend the agreements through 2013, about 2,100 components of small assemblies most of them produced for the Blackhawk program.

We are now finalizing our certification with US State Department allowing transfer of more than half of this work statement to Mexico.

The combination of the transfers of both Boeing and Sikorsky product to our Mexicali facility will grow the annual revenue at our plant by more than 50%.

In addition, we have agreed with Gulfstream to extend our long-term agreement on most of the legacy work on G450 and G550 products through 2015.

This work includes kits produced at our Savannah facility, leading-edge program at our Vista plant, and over 3,000 components of subassemblies produced at several of our sheet metal plants.

In addition, we have agreed to an LTA to produce numerous components for the new G650 aircraft through either a 2015 or 2017.

These extensions and new LTAs together with previous LTAs signed with the Spirit Aerospace, Vaught Aerospace, and Aviation Partners Boeing gives us good visibility of demand for existing Aerostructures products for the next few years.

Given the uncertainty that marked 2009, we are pleased we can turn our attention at Aero to offering added services and capabilities.

As we have stated we are well along with the new processing facility in Mexicali which will be quite busy once the additional work transfers I have mentioned are completed.

And with a clean room expansion at In Tech, our purchase in early 2009, we will expand our ability to manufacture composites.

We have also leased a plant facility adjacent to our Vista plant to produce recently awarded frame sections of the Gulfstream G650 and Boeing 777 aircraft.

Our integrated product team handling our MJET tailcone program is progressing well with PDR, our preliminary design review, having been completed our Engineering Services group continues to perform at a high level and has done a good job of establishing relationships with their MJET counterparts.

In addition, Engineering Services is starting work for a Tier 1 customer on the Airbus 350 program which may provide us entry into other Airbus programs as well.

On the 747-8 we have continued to have awards, many part numbers which are quick-turn products to support the passenger model primarily after having supported the freighter in 2009.

We have several thousand components from multiple customers which we will be negotiating pricing for LTAs on in the near future.

Both Engineering services and Aerostructures are developing new ways to provide engineering services and build of kits or structures with existing major Tier 1 customers and new customers with development projects of size.

We were not awarded any new design build projects in the quarter but we will be providing permanent on-site assistance to a major customer in order to coordinate with them on new projects as well as work on new ways to provide lower-cost engineering services and manufactured products.

We are also having better success at Aerostructures machining facility in California.

Revenue is still well below 2007 and 2008 levels and economic performance has been slow to improve.

On-time delivery and quality performance have improved really and activity with existing customers has increased reflecting the growing confidence our customers have in that plant's management.

Given our balance sheet and the operating momentum evidenced in the last two quarters, we are adding senior staff to prepare for an increasing revenue stream as our industry slowly improves.

We will shortly begin more in-depth reviews of strategic acquisition candidates so that we can support large design build programs as well as large build and engineering projects we are currently quoting.

All-in-all a good bit more optimism from here as we prepare for 2011 and beyond.

We will now take your questions.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by.

Welcome to the Hibbett Sports Incorporated third-quarter 2014 conference call.

During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode.

Afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Friday, November 22, 2013.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mickey Newsome, Chairman of the Board.

Please go ahead, Sir.

Good morning, everyone.

I am Mickey Newsome and also with us is our CEO and President, Jeff Rosenthal, and our Senior VP of Finance and CFO, Scott Bowman, our Senior VP of Marketing and Merchandise, Becky Jones, and our Senior VP of Store Operations, Cathy Pryor.

We will all be available for questions.

We appreciate you being on the call today and we appreciate your interest in Hibbett sporting goods.

Before we start, Scott Bowman will cover the Safe Harbor language.

Thank you and good morning.

In order for us to take advantage of Safe Harbor rules, I would like to remind you that any projections or statements made today reflect our current views with respect to future events in our financial performance.

There is no assurance that such events will occur, or that any projections will be achieved.

Our actual results could differ materially from any projections due to various risk factors which are described in the Company's press release and SEC filings.

Next, our President and CEO, Jeff Rosenthal, will speak with you.

As you know from our press release this morning our third-quarter earnings per share was $0.66 a share.

The weak shift associated with the fiscal calendar resulted in approximately a $0.11 reduction in earnings per diluted share for the period ending November 2.

Overall sales increased 2.5% to $208 million compared to $202.9 million a year ago.

Comparable store sales increased 4.8% on a calendar basis.

The weak shift associated with the fiscal calendar resulted in decreased revenue of approximately $14 million or 7.1% in the third quarter.

The Company narrowed its guidance for the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2014, and expects to report a range of $2.68 to $2.77 earnings per share with an increase in comparable store sales on a calendar basis in the low single digit range.

Comps by month were as follows: August, we were up 8.7%; September, we were down 2.3%; and October, we were up 7.3%.

The first two weeks of November, we are up low single digits; with the shift of Thanksgiving and our launch calendar we are where we expected to be for November.

From a real estate perspective we opened 16 new stores, expanded four high-performing stores and closed four underperforming stores bringing the store base to 904 stores in 31 states.

For the fiscal year 2014, the Company expects to open at least 72 to 75 new stores, expand approximately 15 high-performing stores and close 17 to 20 stores.

The new stores continue to perform above pro forma and gives us even more confidence that we can grow even faster.

We already have more stores in the pipeline for next year at this time.

There is no reason that we should not be a national sporting goods chain with over 1,500 stores.

We are very pleased with our progress at our new wholesale logistics facility.

We are tracking our progress to be on time for the springtime period.

We delivered solid comparable-store sales in the quarter by having a strong Back to School, driven by improved performance in footwear, apparel and accessories.

Demand for our fall assortments have been positive and our inventory is well-positioned to take advantage of the fourth quarter.

Next, our Senior VP of Merchandise and Marketing will speak with you, Becky Jones.

We were pleased with the 4.8% comp performance for the third quarter.

Footwear, equipment, activewear, and accessories drove overall results.

Kids' apparel had a strong quarter and specifically girls' activewear benefited from a better in stock position than a year ago.

The kids' footwear area also posted strong double-digit comps.

Women's branded activewear grew low single digit comps while women's footwear performance has been challenging.

Men's branded activewear was slightly off for the quarter.

Consumers are buying at the time of need, as evidenced in fleece sales when there is a cold snap in our market area.

Licensed apparel has been more -- had a more challenging quarter specifically tied to the downturn of [Snapback Cat].

Men's collegiate licensed apparel was soft, however the women's collegiate apparel had a very nice quarter.

Pro MLB, NBA and NFL apparel performed well and MLB apparel had a strong quarter in part due to the St. Louis Cardinals being in the World Series.

Men's footwear had a positive comp growth in running.

Strong products were Nike Free and Under Armour Pulse.

Although limited pair in the marketplace we are encouraged by Adidas Spring Blade and Boost running shoes.

Men's lifestyle footwear produced a low single digit comp as well.

Basketball footwear performed exceptionally well across all genders and size ranges.

Jordan products have been strong all year.

Likewise, the men's fashion apparel has consistent strong growth.

Top-performing suppliers were Levi and Brand Jordan.

Football equipment and cleats had a very good quarter and the season for this consumer has extended.

The baseball, softball business was basically flat and soccer was down slightly.

Backpacks and socks performed well during the Back to School season.

Overall sellthrough for backpacks exceeded our expectations and consumer demand for socks is robust.

The merchandise, planning, inventory, management and marketing teams have worked collectively to deliver market [right] assortments.

We are comfortable with our inventory position and are poised to have a good holiday season in fourth quarter.

Next our Senior VP of finance and CFO will speak with you, Scott Bowman.

For the third quarter, total sales increased $5 million, $208 million -- an increase of 2.5% over the prior year.

Comp sales on the calendar like for like basis were up 4.8%.

The weak shift in the fiscal calendar due to the 53rd week last year resulted in lower sales of approximately $14 million in the quarter.

Gross profit rate decreased 39 basis points in the quarter.

Product margin decreased 7 basis points, mainly due to markdowns associated with managing our inventory.

Warehouse in-store occupancy deleveraged by 32 basis points.

This deleverage was mainly due to the decrease in sales resulting from the weak shift in the fiscal calendar.

SG&amp;A increased 122 basis points as a percent of sales in the quarter, mainly due to deleverage in salaries and benefits.

Again this is mostly due to the weak shift in the fiscal calendar.

Depreciation and amortization increased 13 basis points as a percent of sales in the quarter.

The income tax rate for the quarter was 37.0% which was slightly lower than last year's rate of 37.3%.

Operating income of $27.4 million decreased 9% from last year and was 13.2% of sales versus 14.9% last year, a decrease of 173 basis points.

Diluted earnings per share came in at $0.66 per share versus $0.71 last year, a decrease of 7.9%.

The weak shift in the fiscal calendar resulted in approximate $0.11 reduction in diluted earnings per share which is similar to the positive effect we experienced in the second quarter.

From a balance sheet perspective, the Company ended the quarter with $69.9 million in cash versus $75.3 million last year with no bank debt.

Inventories increased 11% over last year and were 4.2% higher on a per store basis.

We spent $22.3 million in CapEx for the quarter, including approximately $18.6 million for our new wholesaling and logistics facility.

Also for the quarter, the Company bought back 134,000 shares for a total of $7.1 million.

At quarter end we have approximately $231 million remaining under the existing purchase authorization.

Although we will provide full guidance at our year-end conference call consistent with past practices, I would like to highlight a couple of factors to consider for fiscal 2015.

We will be transitioning next year to our new wholesaling and logistics facility.

This will involve some additional costs during this transition as well as some duplicate costs throughout the year.

Our lease for the current facility terminates in December of next year.

Additionally, the depreciation on the new facility will start in the middle part of next year.

As the Affordable Care Act rolls out we forecast that medical expenses will increase as a result of increased enrollment along with the various charges that are embedded in the Act.

We initially estimate that these factors could have a negative effect of approximately $0.11 to $0.12 per diluted share in fiscal 2015.

Of course, we will include these items when we provide our fiscal 2015 guidance on our fourth-quarter call.

Operator, we are ready for questions.

Good day everyone and welcome to IndyMac Bancorporation's 2nd Quarter 2004 Earnings conference call.

As a reminder today's conference is being recorded.

At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Perry, please go ahead, sir.

Good morning, hope everybody is having a nice Friday morning.

Welcome to 2nd quarter 2004 earnings conference call.

You can follow along on the web at www.indymacbank.com I'm on page 3 of our PowerPoint presentation, which provides an overview.

I'm going to first review our 2nd quarter 2004 results which we're very pleased with.

We think we had a tremendous quarter from an execution stand point, also review an update of forecast for remainder of year.

One of the things that we're trying to do each quarter is also talk about one key issue whether credit risk or interest rate risk or marketing strategies, this quarter obviously with the volatility and interest rates and concern about rising rates and a flattening yield curve, we thought it was appropriate to take a few minutes and talk about interest rate risk management.

Then lastly we'll finish with a review of our historical performance in returns.

So turning to page four, we obviously had a record earnings quarter and when I'm speaking throughout this presentation clearly I'm speaking on a pro forma basis as I think everybody is aware we had disclosed for two or three quarters before this quarter SEC came out with staff accounting bulletin 105 which required that rate locks the revenue on rate locks essentially be deferred that was kind of a one time change.

It really, if you look at that our GAAP earnings were were 38 cents versus the pro forma which were 90 but as was pointed in our press release in our PowerPoint presentation if that accounting standard had been in affect always our GAAP earnings would have been very similar to pro forma earnings of 90 cents this quarter.

So with that I will go through the presentation here.

Obviously pro forma earnings at 90 cents, that's a record for us in terms of earnings.

Up 23% year-over-year.

I think that's a tribute to the execution of our business model and our employees because that was done in a quarter that obviously wasn't the strongest quarter in the mortgage business - the 2nd quarter and 3rd quarter of last year - were clearly much stronger quarters than this second quarter of this year.

EPS up 23% year-over-year to 90 cents that was a combination of gaining market share and growing our investment portfolio executing on our hybrid thrift mortgage banking model.

You can see that our balance sheet is up 46% year-over-year from 10.6 billion to 15.5 billion at end of end of this quarter, I think that's a very, very strong number book value per share up 17% and that's inspite of the fact that we're paying a strong dividend now.

Return on equity, I believe, was close to an all time high for us, you know, it's not as high as a pure mortgage banker because we have signifigant amount of our capital, the bulk of our capital devoted to the investment portfolio the true thrift business and we'll go through that in a little bit.

We sacrificed some return on equity for less volatility in our earnings - a lot less volatility in our earnings.

You can see that our net interest margin has been relatively stable around that 275 range and we are projecting for the remainder of year that it will stay in that kind of stable range.

Mortgage loan production was all time record, $9.4 billion.

Our mortgage banking units - a variety of our mortgage banking units did a tremendous job.

That volume is up 18% year-over-year.

Of the top 25 mortgage lenders there are very few that are gonna have their volume up year-over-year comparing the 2nd quarter of '03 to the 2nd quarter of '04.

Our mortgage market share is up an impressive 66% year-over-year from .67% to 1.11 and I think just as impressive is the fact that essentially our market share was flat from - it was 1.12 last quarter and we had a little mini refinance boom during this quarter and we were able to hold market share and I'll show you a slide later on that shows, normally when the refi.

booms hit IndyMac looses market share given our product mix and our relatively small servicing portfolio.

Gain on sale margins were a little bit lower, we're forecasting them - and I'll go through that later - to be even lower in the second half of year due to competition.

But we haven't seen any major pressure on gain on sale margins so, I think - you know, we feel very comfortable with our gain on sale margins and what we're projecting for the remainder of year.

As I said, our dividend is something that we're very committed to with our hybrid thrift mortgage banking model.

We did increase our dividend from 30 cents to 32 in the quarter.

If you compare that 1st quarter to 2nd quarter that's a 27% increase in the dividend, year-over-year it's a huge increase 113%.

I think you'll see us continue to increase the dividend somewhere between our 15% long term EPS growth rate goal and our actual EPS growth rate goal which has been around 27-28% so somewhere between 15-27-28% is what you should expect our dividend on an annual basis to increase, and we'd like to ratchet it up every quarter.

Nonperforming assets remain very stable like all financial institutions credit quality has been excellent and really I don't think it can get much better than this you certainly could see credit quality get slightly worse if real estate values or the economy starts to get hurt.

Turning to page 5, we gave you - I don't want to go through this in great detail, but basically we reconciled - well, how do you get from 70 cents in the first quarter to 90 cents in the 2nd quarter that's a big, big change.

Or comparing it to the 73 cents we earned in the same quarter last year.

And the basic difference there is spread income, our thrift - well part of our hybrid thrift mortgage banking model, increased earnings in the year-over-year comparison as in 35 cents a share.

Mortgage banking increased earnings 9 cents a share offset by our worst quarter ever in our mortgage servicing rights asset - we had all 27 cent loss when you compare that year-over-year, and I'll discuss that more in just a few minutes.

So that gives you a basic reconciliation between last year same quarter and then the 1st quarter this year to the 90 cents this year.

I think it shows power of our balance between our hybrid thrift mortgage banking model.

If you turn to page 6, clearly market share gains are gonna be an important driver of growth when the market overall is not growing or even declining, while the 2nd quarter of this year which we thought was gonna be, another declining market actually ended up, because of rates coming down and being a very strong quarter, 848 billion I think it was probably the 3rd or 4th best quarter in the history of the mortgage business.

I think the impressive thing as I said, is we kept our market share essentially flat 1.12 in the 1st quarter, 1.11 up 66% year- over-year.

So, I mean, I think that is tremendous numbers and that has to do with a combination of our execution on our geographic strategy, expanding our geographic presence our channel presence, but also our product mix which tends to be less rate in term refinance oriented, and less interest rate sensitive with a major portion of our business coming in All Day, construction, sub-prime and home equity lending.

And you can see, I'm not gonna go through each percentage increase, but we had very strong growth rates in those core products such that our overall production is up 18% year-over-year.

I think even more impressive is our purchase volume is up 61% year- over-year and 45% from the 1st quarter to the 2nd quarter alone.

Our ARM production also, you know because we have the ability to portfolio and transition very quickly from a fixed rate market to an ARM market, our ARM production is up 110% year-over-year and so that's translated in for IndyMac is that even though the NBA application index is down 64% year-over-year our mortgage pipeline is only down 25% and that's really largely driven by our growth in our purchase pipeline which is up 48% year-over-year and the 5.17 pipeline that we had at the end of June is actually closer to 6 billion, just under 6 billion today.

Turning to page 7, this really shows the strength of our mortgage banking piece of our business and the product mix we that we have the All Day, the construction focus, the home equity lending focus.

We had record production this quarter and I think if you look at our numbers since we implemented [inaudible] and derated in the first quarter of 1999 and really started to build our mortgage banking business, our compounded annual growth rate and mortgage production is 42% a year versus the industry at 17 and the top five mortgage lenders at 18.

As we pointed out before, every time mortgage industry volumes quarter over quarter, and you see that chart on the far right of this page, IndyMac tends to gain market share that largely offsets those market share declines.

The other point to make is, this 2nd quarter while we didn't gain share, we were essentially flat with a minus 1% decline in market share.

Mortgage industry volumes went up 37%.

The last time mortgage industry volumes were up which was the 2nd quarter of 2003 and they were up 49%, we lost 17% market share in that quarter.

So we are doing a better job in the markets where IndyMac tends to loose market share and we will gain market share as we expect the mortgage industry volumes to decline in the 3rd and 4th quarters of this year and into next year.

If you think about that, the power of those market share gains combined with our thrift strategy of growing balance sheet and spread income combined with our servicing assets turning around is all very positive for our future earnings.

Page 8, and I'm not gonna go through this in detail, essentially we go through and we evaluate our forecasting and our production for the 3rd and 4th quarter, we go through and utilize two methodologies, one is a very bottoms up approach to business unit by business unit forecasting what our production volume is gonna be for the 3rd and 4th quarter.

This slide in particular is the slide where we double check that volume given to us by production units by taking into account our rate lock history and our pull-through of rate locks and our mortgage pipelines.

Suffice it to say we're predicting a range of production for the 3rd quarter of 6.73-9.76 billion the midpoint of that range is at 8.2 that's the macro change.

And our business units predicted 8.4 billion from their bottoms up approach that is what we are using in our forecast for the 3rd quarter.

If we hit that number our market share will be somewhere around 1.31 - 1.35 for the quarter and we think we will hit that number and produce those strong market share gains.

If you turn to page 10, it's kind of talking about the rest of the year we are raising our guidance to a range of about 335-355 up from prior 310-330.

We have a lot of confidence in our hybrid thrift mortgage banking model and we're projecting that in the 3rd quarter that we're going to have production be down around 8.4 but our market share will be around 1.42%.

The net interest margin about similar, we're even projecting little lower gain on sales and we're gonna sell slightly more loans 82% of production.

Operating expense is gonna be a little higher because obviously volumes are down a little bit.

And we're projecting slightly down earning assets, so you'd say, "well, how do you drive the same 90 cent earnings?

", we're projecting that our servicing asset is gonna turn around from a record loss in the 2nd quarter - which I'll talk about the reasons behind that - to a very small profit in the 3rd quarter as rates rise and stabilize.

And what we're projecting for the year and how we get to 345, 'cause we are projecting that the debt funds rate increases another 100 basis points from 125-225 by end of year.

Ten year treasury rates which drive fixed rate mortgage rates going up from 458-495 so we'll see a clearly rise - about a half percent rise in mortgage rates and a flattening of yield curve as a result of those interest rate forecast.

We are also including in our assumption that we will close Final Freedom in July and mid-July which is the largest reverse mortgage company in the country.

We are factoring in 5 million of earnings from that net of our purchase accounting.

It's kind of interesting, the SAB - just as an interesting side - is a former account.

And SAB 105 required us to not recognize servicing value on rate loss and we backed that out this quarter.

But then when you purchase a company the accounting rules still require you to book the fair value of the pipeline which includes that value so it under states our Financial Freedom's actual earnings because it goes into part of the purchase price as opposed to flowing through earnings.

So bottom line is, we feel strong about the rest of the this year and very positive about our hybrid thrift mortgage banking model.

Page 11 gives you that similar reconciliation that we gave you reconciling the quarter to prior quarters, reconciling the first half of the year to the second half of the year.

We earned $1.60 in the first half of the year and we project to earn $1.85 in the second half of the year.

8 cents of that earnings difference will be Financial Freedom, 41 cents will be the recovery in our servicing fee income as a result of lower expected prepayment speeds and 24 cents will be declining mortgage banking profits.

Now the point here is, if prepayment speeds don't decline as much and we don't receive the 41 cents, we won't also have the 24 cent decline in mortgage banking profits.

We feel very comfortable that we're going to execute on this and there are always many risks to executing on our business model, but I think we've got a strong track record of accomplishing what we have said we were going to do.

If you turn to page 12.

This really is a slide meant to show you that we truly run a hybrid thrift mortgage banking model, as I said, if we were a pure mortgage banker, and you can go look in our Q, and see the returns on equity for our pure mortgage banking business they're in the 30s, 40s, 50s, 60% returns on equity and up, but we don't have all of our capital devoted to the mortgage banking business, in fact, we have the bulk of our capital outside the mortgage banking business in our traditional thrift businesses of holding mortgage loans, mortgage back securities, construction loans, home equity loans.

You can see in the first half, if you look in the middle of this page, we had a billion one of average capital in the first half of 2004, 669 million if that was in our traditional thrift activities and only onto 7% return on equity because that portfolio has a bias towards rising rates especially with the servicing asset being part of that portfolio.

The mortgage banking business at only 317 million of capital and earned 72% return on equity, which is great but down from 2003s 115% return on equity, such that when you factor in excess capital and corporate over head in the first half of the year we earned a 17% return on equity.

We're projecting the second half of the year to earn a 19% return on equity essentially flat returns in our mortgage banking business but lower capital dedicated to that, about 254 million growing our capital in our thrift activity to 715 million and that recovering at the bias towards rising rates drives the returns up to more traditional levels around 17% return on equity.

That's another macro way to look at how we get our earnings forecast for the remainder of year.

And I think that those are very strong numbers.

We're looking at a market share number in the first half of the year of 1.11 up from .77 in the prior year and a second half market share of 1.59% for IndyMac such that we have a 1.31 market share for the year up 70% from .77 during the peek of the refinance boom last year.

Turning to interest rate risk management, some of you have followed IndyMac for a long time who will remember this slide.

We just cleaned it up and updated it.

But our primary objective in interest rate risk management is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on our equity.

The fair value being marking to market our assets and our liabilities for fair value change in our equity.

In other words, that's our primary objective to make sure that equity is not impacted by interest rate risk.

Our secondary objective and an important one, and one that we've done very successfully over last 11 years is to maintain consistent and growing quarterly and annual EPS through a variety of interest rate environments and so, our hedging strategies include a micro hedge on our servicing asset, we'd hedge servicing, and we have a specific servicing hedge, we also hedge our mortgage pipeline of rate locks and funded loans pending their sale in market have been very successful at that.

The rest of our balance sheet, which is primarily thrift balance sheet, we duration hedge with term funding swaps and swaptions for NBS's and mortgage loan sale for investment, and the rest of our balance sheet, which is primarily short term in nature, home equity loans and construction loans, we fund with short duration liability, we then put that in an overall asset liability model which includes a market to market of equity and adjust each of these hedge position on weekly basis.

We have an alcove committee, a management alcove that meets on a weekly basis.

Some shareholders have asked - and we're gonna begin publishing this every quarter - is a very simple, and this is a very simple interest rate risk analysis because a duration GAAP analysis is not as sophisticated as a net portfolio value ALM analysis, or what we ultimately want to publish is a bar similar to the Wall Street firms and I think that our goal is to try and have that done by the end of the year, a value - like a daily value at risk, but I think this gives you a good idea and we've talked a lot about the fact that we try to keep our balance sheet relatively matched, there is some bias in our balance sheet, as we've said, a bias towards rising rates a negative 3 month duration which means that our assets are shorter than our liability by 3 months - which means that as interest rates rise that will benefit our balance sheet.

And we've set our balance sheet up in that fashion because our mortgage banking business obviously has the other bias, the bias towards falling rates.

So we think that balance, having our balance sheet have a bias towards rising rates is a great offset to our mortgage banking business having a bias towards falling rates.

I'm not gonna go through each of these categories yet, but I'll be happy to answer questions for you later on.

I think another point, and this goes to our pipeline hedging, we've been a hedger all along in managing the margin or in business.

I hear a lot of times when interest rates rise, that margins have been compressed, a lot of competition, blah, blah, blah, we tend to have not seen that it may be our product mix, but I suspect a lot of it has to do with the fact that people are using hedging strategies that create volatility in their profit margins.

And I think here, if you look at this, you can take our gross gain on sale number and you can see that our gross-margin in 2002 was 3% - 3.04 and 2003 was 1.81 and this year so far, if we hadn't hedged we would have a .71 gross gain on sale margin.

And you can see our hedging gains our losses on our pipeline hedge such that our net margin comes out relatively consistent, 1.79-1.67- 1.55 and when you add spread income on loans sale per sale which is really part of that margin and fee income and calculate total mortgage banking revenue our total mortgage banking revenue has been very consistent year-over-year and period over period in a variety of volatile interest rate environments.

The next page, 17, goes through - and it's interesting as we recently just got all of the pieces of our servicing asset put together in what we think is the correct fashion to look at it which is, you have your servicing asset and the investment in that asset which is very similar to an interest only security - which we hedge that asset, but that's the investing profits.

But you also have servicing retention.

Given the fact that we have a very small direct to consumer business we wouldn't have obtained loans from refinances but from servicing portfolio.

So giving credit to the servicing portfolio for the retention profits we've made a total profit on our servicing portfolio even in 2002 and 2003 of 15-17% ROE, in the 1st quarter it was 16 so very similar ROE's, the 2nd quarter of this year we really had our worst performance ever in our servicing asset and we've got about $200 million of our capital devoted to this business.

It is turning around this quarter as prepayments are dramatically slowing but, as was noted in a number of earnings releases by competitors, the 2nd quarter of 2004 was a difficult quarter to hedge this asset.

We had clearly eased up a little on our hedges creating that bias towards rising rates so that hurt us a little bit when rates fell, but also spreads on mortgages and swaps tightened the treasure yield curve flattened, and rates were extremely volatile in the quarter.

And while there is no guarantee that we won't have a similar quarter, I think that the point here is, we had a horrible quarter on this servicing asset and still had record earnings and I think that's the power of our model and I don't think we feel going forward, while there is no guarantee a quarter like this won't happen again, we feel certainly feel that this portfolio is turning around in the 3rd quarter and will turn around in 3rd and 4th and into next year especially as rates begin to rise.

If you turn to page 19, I'm not gonna go through this in great detail, the point here is, whether you measure us, you know since we derated and moved on the path of becoming a depository, or since this management team has been in place since January of 1993, our track record has been extremely strong in terms of driving shareholder value and driving growth.

Revenue beings up 27% in the last four and a half years 49% since January of 1993, earnings up 37% over that 11-year period and you can see our comparable returns.

The bottom line is we've out performed the market about double.

And I think, you know, you look at it - we're projecting, you know, in our comp ended down on growth rate turning to page 20 on EPS is 32% year-over-year.

That is a faster growth rate than our historical growth rate of 28%.

I think we feel very comfortable, in concluding, that our hybrid thrift mortgage banking model, while we are not diversified around the - with our business being all focused around single family mortgage lending we've diversified the various asset classes in our allocation of capital between the thrift and mortgage banking business and that combined with our hedging activities results in a very stable business model to drive earnings going forward.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the North American Scientific fiscal year 2004 financial results conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.

Mr. Cutrer, you may begin your conference.

I am Mike Cutrer, President and CEO of North American Scientific.

I'm joined here today by Jim Klingler, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Welcome to North American Scientific's fiscal 2004 fourth-quarter and year-end conference call.

I would like to extend a special welcome to anyone who is a first-time participant on these calls.

The delays in the filings of our third-quarter results on Forms 10-Q/A as well as our fiscal year results on Forms 10-Q/A, as well as our fiscal-year results on Form 10-K arose from certain accounting issues related to revenue recognition and the valuation of intangible assets arising from our acquisition of NOMOS on May 4, 2004.

Jim will provide detail on the issues reported in the press release related to the delay in the filing of the 10-K and the restated 10-Q/A.

The filing of our first-quarter 2005 results on Form 10-Q will be delayed, due to the delays in filing our Form 10-K. We recognize the importance of timely filings, and we'll do everything we can to complete the Q1 review as quickly as possible.

We will not be discussing our first-quarter 2005 results until we issue our press release for the first quarter.

Though this process was a long one, the Company recognizes that the integrity of the financial markets rely on a thorough review of issues such as revenue recognition, to ensure that financial reporting is correctly stated, particularly in today's financial environment.

We appreciate your patience throughout this process.

We reported record net sales of 24.7 million for the fiscal year versus 14.7 million for the prior year.

The increase in sales was a result of the NOMOS acquisition.

Net sales by operating segment in fiscal year 2004 included 13 million from Radiation Sources, which are brachytherapy and other radioisotope-based products, and 11.7 million of IMRT and IGRT products from the NOMOS acquisition which was completed in May, and therefore reflects only six months of sales in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004.

Fiscal 2004 was a year of strategic realignment for North American Scientific, where we completed the acquisition of NOMOS, we discontinued Theseus operations in September and we continued to introduce important new products to the radiation therapy marketplace.

I will provide details on what this means to North American Scientific and its shareholders going forward, but first, let me turn the call ever to Jim to review our financial highlights.

Thank you, Mike.

Before I begin, I'd like to read the following statement.

In connection with this conference call, the Company wishes to take advantage of the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, with respect to statements that may be deemed to be forward-looking statements under the act.

Such forward-looking statements could include general or specific comments by company officials about future performance, as well as certain responses to questions proposed to company officials about future operating matters.

The Company wishes to caution participants in this call that numerous factors could call actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made by the Company.

These factors include the risk factors set forth in the Company's SEC filings.

Any forward-looking statements made in this call speaks only as of the date of this call, and the Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future results, or otherwise.

As Mike noted, our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2004 was (technical difficulty) in filing our Form 10-Q/A for the third quarter of 2004.

In addition, our Form 10-K was delayed due to the time required to review and restate the values of certain intangible assets acquired from NOMOS.

In connection with our acquisition of NOMOS on May 4, 2004, we engaged a valuation specialist firm to assist the company in determining the fair value of certain identified intangible assets acquired from NOMOS.

We utilize the valuation report to assign the intangible asset values to the assets acquired, as reported in the Form 8-K dated July 19, 2004; the Form 10-Q dated September 20, 2004; and the Forms 10-Q/A dated September 21, 2004 and January 27, 2005.

However, on January 31, 2005, during the process of finalizing our annual financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2004, it was noted that there was an inconsistency in the royalty rate used to value the trademark and the royalty rate used for the trademark contributory asset charge, which resulted in improperly valuing the fair values of NOMOS in-process R&amp;D, purchased technology and customer relationship intangible assets.

We concluded that the error materially misstated the values assigned to the acquired intangible assets and the opening purchase price allocation, and we recognized that there were material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to this matter.

We subsequently engaged a second valuation firm to properly calculate the intangible asset values, and we utilized that report in the restatement of the financial statements for the quarter ended July 31, 2004, as filed on Form 10-Q/A, amendment No.

3, dated March 11, 2005, and in the financial statements in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2004.

Having said that, let's start off by reviewing the results of operations for our fourth-quarter and fiscal year, and follow with key balance sheet components as of October 31, 2004.

Please note that the financial comparisons I describe in this review are for the continuing operations of the Company, and do not include the results of the discontinued Theseus operations, which are reported as a discontinued operation in the financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2004.

For the fourth quarter ended October 31, 2004, the Company reported net record net sales of approximately 9.8 million, a 169 percent increase over net sales of 3.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2003.

This increase is due to the revenues contributed from the IMRT/IGRT business acquired from NOMOS.

Net sales by operating segment in the fourth quarter of 2004 included 6.8 million of IMRT/IGRT products and 3 million of Radiation Sources, which our brachytherapy and other radioisotope-based products, which decreased 18 percent versus the corresponding period last year, due to reduced volume.

As Mike said, for fiscal 2004, we reported record net sales of 24.7 million for the fiscal year versus 14.7 million for the prior year.

We attribute the increase in sales to the NOMOS acquisition.

Net sales by operating segment in the fiscal year 2004 included 11.7 million of IMRT/IGRT products and 13 million from Radiation Sources, which decreased 12 percent versus the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the ongoing transition that began in the second quarter of 2003 from selling our brachytherapy products through a distributor to selling them directly to end customers.

Our net loss from continuing operations for the fourth quarter, excluding the discontinued Theseus operations, was 5.5 million or 35 cents a share.

This compared to a net loss from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2003 of 0.5 million or 6 cents a share.

The increase in the net loss from continuing operations of 5 million was primarily due to one, the addition of the IMRT/IGRT operations acquired from NOMOS, 1.4 million; a charge for excess inventory, 1.2 million; increased amortization of intangible assets, 0.6 million; reduced sales of Radiation Sources, 0.5 million; the consolidation of PCA, a variable interest entity, 0.3 million; an increase in operating expenses described below, 1.0 million.

Net loss from continuing operations for the fiscal year, excluding the discontinued Theseus operations, was 23.8 million or $1.81 per share.

This compared to a net loss from continuing operations for the fiscal year 2003 of 0.6 million or 6 cents a share.

The increase in net loss from continuing operations of 23.2 million was primarily due to costs related to the NOMOS acquisition, 10.2 million; the addition of IMRT/IGRT operations acquired from NOMOS, 3.6 million; a charge for excess inventory, 1.2 million; increased amortization of intangible assets, 1.2 million; reduced sales of Radiation Sources, 2.4 million; the consolidation of PCA, a variable interest entity, 0.9 million; an increase in operating expenses, which will be described below, 2.5 million; a decrease in interest and other income, 1.2 million.

Our fourth-quarter gross profit increased 0.9 million over the same quarter last year.

Gross profit margin was 26 percent in the fourth quarter, compared to 46 percent for the prior-year fourth quarter.

Gross margin for the 2004 quarter includes results of the IMRT/IGRT product line that were acquired in May 2004, and excess inventory charges of 1.2 million or 12 percent of total sales recorded at year end.

Gross margin for Radiation Sources was 40 percent of sales for the fourth quarter, compared to 46 percent of sales for the same quarter last year.

The reduction in Radiation Sources gross margin is primarily due to reduced unit volume, as average selling prices were even with last year.

IMRT/IGRT gross margin was 21 percent of sales in the fourth quarter of 2004, which represented a decline versus a gross margin of 40 percent of sales in the third quarter of 2004.

The reduction in IMRT gross margin is primarily due to excess inventory charges of 1.2 million, or 18 percent of IMRT/IGRT sales recorded at year end, which accounted for most of the decline from the third quarter of 2004.

Our gross profit for the fiscal year 2004 increased 1.2 million over last year.

Gross profit margin was 36 percent of sales in the fiscal 2004, compared to 53 percent of sales for the prior year.

Gross margin for fiscal year 2004 includes results of the IMRT/IGRT product lines that were acquired in May 2004, and excess inventory charges of 1.2 million or 5 percent of total sales recorded at year end.

Gross margin for Radiation Sources was 43 percent of sales for the fiscal year, compared to 53 percent of sales for the last year.

The reduction in Radiation Sources gross margin is primarily due to reduced unit volume, as average selling prices were even with last year.

IMRT/IGRT gross margin was 29 percent of sales in fiscal 2004.

The IMRT/IGRT gross margin was impacted by excess inventory charges of 1.2 million or 10 percent of IMRT/IGRT sales recorded at year end, and 0.2 million or 2 percent of IMRT/IGRT sales of costs related to the BAT upgrade program.

Going forward, we would hope to see an improvement in gross margins due to increased unit volumes, improved selling prices, lower product costs, and the elimination of excess inventory charges.

Selling expenses for the fourth quarter of 2004 increased approximately 1.8 million to 2.8 million from 1.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.

Selling expenses increased 3.3 million to 6.7 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004 from 3.4 million in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2003.

The increase in selling expenses in both the quarter and the fiscal year is attributed to the addition of our IMRT/IGRT business in May 2004.

For the fourth quarter 2004, G&amp;A increased 2.5 million to 3.8 million versus 1.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.

The increase in G&amp;A is primarily attributed to the addition of our IMRT/IGRT business, 1.4 million; an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts, 0.5 million; an increase in accounting and legal fees, 0.5 million.

G&amp;A increased 6.0 million or 98 percent to 12.2 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004 from 6.2 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2003.

The increase in G&amp;A is primarily attributed to the addition of our IMRT/IGRT business, 2.3 million; severance costs, 1.0 million; the consolidation of PCA, a variable interest entity, 1.1 million; an increase in accounting fees, 1.0 million; an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts, 0.5 million.

As we look to fiscal 2005, we do not anticipate a recurrence of the onetime charges incurred in fiscal 2004, and we expect G&amp;A expenses to return to the fiscal 2003 levels.

R&amp;D from continuing operations, excluding the discontinued Theseus operations for the fourth quarter, increased to 1.3 million, compared to 0.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2003.

R&amp;D from continuing operations, excluding the discontinued Theseus operations, increased 2.7 million to 3.2 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004 from 0.5 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2003.

The increase in R&amp;D spending in both the quarter and the fiscal year is due to the addition of the IMRT/IGRT business in May 2004.

Amortization of intangible assets for the fourth quarter increased to 0.6 million compared to $8,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, and amortization of intangible assets increased to 1.2 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004 from 13,000 in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2003.

The increase in amortization and intangible assets in both the quarter and the fiscal year is due to the addition of the IMRT/IGRT business in May, 2004.

In-process research and development -- during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004, we purchased NOMOS, and as a result, incurred a charge of 9.2 million in in-process research and development.

Also, as a result of our purchase of NOMOS, we incurred 1.1 million in merger and integration costs.

Interest and other income decreased to $92,000 in the fourth quarter of 2004 from $215,000 in the fourth quarter of 2003, due to the reduction in marketable securities.

Interest and other income decreased 1.1 million or 67 percent to 0.6 million for the fiscal year ended 2004 from 1.7 million for the fiscal year ended 2003.

This decrease reflects lower interest income, as a result of a reduced portfolio of marketable securities in fiscal 2004, and a gain of approximately 0.6 million resulting from the sale of our remaining shares of RadioMed Corporation, a privately-held company, in fiscal 2003.

Turning to the balance sheet, at October 31, 2004, the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 15.0 million, a decrease of approximately 34 million from year end 2003.

Although our cash and marketable securities balance has declined from the historical levels, due primarily to cash payments in connection with the NOMOS acquisition, expenses related to the discontinued Theseus operations, and slower-than-expected sales, we continue to remain to debt-free.

The decrease in cash was primarily attributed to net cash payments of 13.2 million for the acquisition of NOMOS, 14.9 million used in continuing operations, 8.4 million used in discontinued Theseus operations, 1.3 million used for capital expenditures, partially offset by 3.7 million in cash received from the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan.

During fiscal year 2004, our trade accounts receivable balance increased 5.0 million to 7.1 million, primarily due to the addition of our IMRT/IGRT business in May, 2004.

We assess our allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of each quarter.

It is currently at 0.6 million, compared to 0.1 million at the end of fiscal 2003.

Our inventory balances increased 4.2 million, and our net equipment and leasehold improvements increased 1.1 million.

Both increases were primarily due to the addition of our IMRT/IGRT business in May, 2004.

Our accounts payable and accrued expenses increased approximately 2.1 million, due to the addition of our IMRT/IGRT business in May 2004 -- 3.0 million -- partially offset by payments to vendors.

Stockholders' equity at the end of the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004 totaled 65.4 million, an increase of 9.7 million from the end of the fiscal year ended October 31, 2003.

Currently, we have 16.3 million shares outstanding.

Now, I'll turn it back over to Mike.

Fiscal 2004 was a year of strategic realignment.

On September 15th, we discontinued the operation of our Boston-based Theseus subsidiary, which we had acquired in October of 2000.

Theseus had been in the development of a radiopharmaceutical product candidate to be used in the management of chemotherapy treatment.

Although a few groups expressed some preliminary interest in purchasing the assets of the group, no firm offers were received.

Termination of this development program, for which most costs were being expensed as incurred, will allow us to redirect funds to growing our radiation therapy operations.

Equally important in our strategic realignment was the acquisition of NOMOS Corporation in May of 2004.

This acquisition further enhances our portfolio of products and technologies for the treatment of cancer, by allowing us to expand into the growing IMRT and IGRT markets.

NOMOS is recognized as a pioneer in the IMRT and IGRT fields, and its products had been used to treat a variety of cancers at hospitals and freestanding radiation oncologist centers.

As a result of the acquisition, we're now able to offer two primary radiation therapy options to the radiation oncologists, brachytherapy, an intensity-modulated radiation therapy.

During 2004, we were pleased to announce two positive developments in connection with our IMRT and IGRT products.

The first was the launch of our camera-based BAT SXi system with optical tracking and localization capability, which will expand clinical applications for this innovative tumor localization system.

The second was the introduction of ActiveRx, a revolutionary set of real-time dose-adjustment tools for IMRT treatment planning, incorporated into the Company's latest version of its premiere IMRT software planning tool known as CORVUS.

ActiveRx provides a set of fully-automated interactive tools that empower clinicians to directly manipulate dose volumes in real time, allowing clinicians to reduce their inverse planning cycles from minutes to seconds, while maintaining maximum control over results.

Recently, the Company made its first sales of brachytherapy products in Europe, and we anticipate continued growth from product overseas.

We're also in the registration process for our brachytherapy products in China, and anticipate completion of this process later this summer.

We believe the new product introductions in all lines of our product portfolio throughout 2005 will help fuel growth and profitability.

Our sales force directly markets and sells our IMRT and IGRT and brachytherapy products in the U.S., with international sales being supported with distributors and agents.

Looking forward, we continue to believe that our fiscal 2005 revenues will be approximately 50 million.

As we enter fiscal 2005, we are focused on profitability.

We recognize the need to reduce expenses, which has already been initiated, as well as carefully managing our research and development programs.

We anticipate improved selling prices for our IGRT product lines, as we introduce new products and enhance the sales and marketing efforts, both domestically and internationally.

Completing both the termination of the Theseus operations and the NOMOS acquisition impacted our cash position.

That being said, management believes that our plans for cost containment, new product introduction and international growth will allow us to achieve positive cash flow during 2005 fiscal year.

In closing, we want to thank our investors for your patience during this transition period.

We look forward to your continued support, as we enter the next year of improved profitability for our Company.

So at this time, I'd like to open a call to questions.

Welcome to the third-quarter fiscal 2010 investment community conference call of Infinera Corporation.

All lines will be on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session.

Today's call is being recorded.

If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bob Blair of Infinera Investor Relations.

Sir, you may begin.

Today's call will include projections and estimates that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

These statements addressed the financial condition, results of operations, business initiatives, views on our markets and customers, our products, and our competitors products, and prospects of the Company including Q4 2010 and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements.

We have excluded non-cash stock-based compensation expenses from this guidance because we cannot readily estimate the impact of our future stock price on our future stock-based compensation expenses.

I will now turn the call over to Infinera President and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Fallon.

Good afternoon and thanks for joining us.

With me is our CFO Ita Brennan.

Our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 were outstanding, representing the strongest validation yet of our long-term business model.

We posted records in revenue, corporate gross margin and shipments of our tributary adapter modules.

In addition, the combination of stronger revenue, higher profit margins and ongoing operating expense control resulted in significant income leverage with an operating income contribution $18.5 million for the quarter.

This compares to operating income of $3 million for Q2.

At the beginning of the year, we stated we would focus on profitability and I believe these numbers speak clearly to the results of that effort.

Specifically, our gross margin achievement of 51% in Q3 is a powerful proof point of the long-term business model and representative of where we believe we can take the business consistently over the long term.

While our financial results for the third quarter were exceptional, our bookings during the quarter were below our expectations.

We believe this is related to a number of factors -- a return to more typical, shorter lead times in North America, the completion of some customers' recent capacity additions, renewed economic uncertainty affecting some of our customers buying behavior and the inherent lumpiness of the DWDM industry.

Overall, this gives us less visibility than we have had in recent quarters.

We continue to have strong market share both domestically and internationally which we believe is the ultimate litmus test of customers' continued confidence in our product roadmap.

However, we think it's reasonable to expect our growth trajectory will moderate from time to time to accommodate periods of network absorption and our fourth quarter appears to be one of those periods.

It is important to note that we are seeing strength in the overall pipeline of deals in our major geographies as demand for capacity continues its inevitable growth.

We are competing for these significant pieces of business but the outcomes and timing are hard to predict at this time.

Our market share of success demonstrates customers' continued confidence in our unique and differentiated PIC-based networks and our expanded product roadmap that provides end-to-end solutions.

We believe that carriers continue to invest in our networks because we consistently deliver on our proven value proposition of superior economics, quality, reliability and network utilization.

More than six years after our introduction of the industry's first PIC-based digital optical network, not one of our numerous DWDM competitors has accomplished the feat of bringing to market a network based on the intelligence of a digital optical architecture.

We think that optics and bandwidth management are the core of the optical network and that optical integration is critical to achieving the all-important scaling and lowest total cost of ownership for our customers' transport networks.

This approach is what makes Infinera foundationally different than other DWDM players.

Our value proposition has lead us to an expansion of the number of our DWDM market share position on a revenue bases in North America to 39% versus 20% a year ago and our worldwide share to 15% up from 10% a year ago based on data from Dell'Oro for the first half of this calendar year.

We are confident based on our Q3 performance that we will continue to have strong market share.

Considering that we do not yet participate in most North America Tier 1 opportunities, this is a remarkable accomplishment and validation of our unique value proposition in the marketplace.

We believe our share numbers demonstrate continued strength in 10G network deployments and the confidence our customers have in their systems compatibility with our 40G cheek and 100G solutions that we have committed to ship in mid-2011 and in 2012 respectively.

Our customer base grew with the addition of two new invoice customers in the third quarter and we believe we are on track to reach at least 80 customers by the end of the year.

Earlier today you may have seen that we announced that Midcontinent Communications, one of the nation's largest independent cable providers, has deployed an Infinera network in the Dakotas and Minnesota.

We continue to enjoy strong support from our cable customers who find our PIC-based solutions provide the simplicity and scalability to meet the rapidly growing Internet and IP video demand they see.

Adding new customers remains an important objective.

At the same time, expanding business with our now sizable roster of existing customers through the sale of new solutions and expansion into untapped territories is of equal importance.

On that note, I'm very pleased to report today that Infinera gear has recently been certified by Qwest Communications for use in their regulated business and we have been deployed in select Qwest local markets.

This is in addition to our existing national deployments request.

I'm also pleased to report that we added six new customers for our ATN Metro product in Q3, bringing the total number of ATN customers to 15.

Nearly 20% of our customers now deploy the ATN, an encouraging sign that network operators find value in the simplicity and efficiency of an integrated VPN plus ATN network solution.

Longer term, we continue to have significant untapped growth opportunities to expand the Infinera footprint both in underpenetrated geographies such as Europe, South America and Japan and newer product areas such as subsea and metro edge.

Our investments will continue to be targeted at expanding our presence in these markets and in strengthening our competitive and differentiated technology leadership position in our core DWDM market.

On that front, our ongoing product development investments have yielded some important investments advances during the quarter.

In September, we were pleased to demonstrate our 100G coherent PIC technology over a 1300 km route from Denver to Dallas with our long-time customer, XO Communications.

You may recall that in July.

we told you that we had successfully [taped out] our coherent 5 x 100G receiver PIC.

The XO demonstration was significant because it was the first demonstration to include this newly fabricated receiver PIC plus our existing 5 x 100G transmitter PIC.

Another key aspect of this trial was that it was accomplished over an existing Infinera line system, the same line system that we had been selling to our customers, thereby demonstrating that the investment our customers make with us today is preserved when they move to future transmission speeds.

Finally, the demonstration highlighted another key advantage of our product, namely our system's ability to successfully run 100G and 10G waves simultaneously over the same infrastructure.

The response from the customer base of this trial was extremely positive with several customers requesting similar trials.

Also in September, in partnership with our European customer, Colt, we completed a successful trial of 100 Gb ethernet services which ran over Colt's existing London to Frankfurt Infinera network.

This is the latest of several such trials we have conducted and it demonstrate not only that Infinera is leading a leader in this technology, but also that 100 Gb ethernet services can be delivered over today's Infinera products.

Earlier this month, we also announced the launch of our digital OTN solution made possible by new releases of hardware and software on both our DTN and ATN platforms.

Network operators are excited about OTN because it improves their network efficiency and manageability.

We believe Infinera's new offerings represent the most complete OTN implementation in the industry, combining OTN service interfaces, switching and transmission while operating seamlessly across both metro and long haul.

The new digital OTN products are in customers' hands today and will become generally available by the end of the month.

We remain bullish about the long-term growth potential of our served markets and about our ability to grow faster over time in the overall market.

The ever expanding scaling requirements and the needs of our carrier customers to support the growth of high-bandwidth services we believe will result in strong industry demand over the next several years.

This coupled with our unique technology advantage, expanding and deepening customer relationships and a broadening of our solutions offerings builds the foundation for us to consistently achieve our long-term business model.

In closing, I want to thank the Infinera team and our supply partners in helping us to achieve a Q3 performance to be proud of.

I also want to acknowledge our customers who are the primary reason for our success.

On a separate note, I want to acknowledge and thank Jagdeep Singh, one of our founders, for his tremendous contributions to the Company.

As indicated in an 8-K filing today, Jagdeep has stepped down from our Board of Directors to devote his time and energies to the pursuit of his next ventures.

He started the Company along with Dave Welch and Drew Perkins almost 10 years ago, built a world-class team, took Infinera public, lead us through the economic downturn and successfully transitioned the Company to this management team.

Ita will now provide you a report on our Q3 financial performance and our outlook for the December quarter.

I'll review our Q3 results and then follow that up with our outlook for Q4.

following analysis of our Q3 results based on non-GAAP.

All references exclude non-cash stock-based compensation and any restructuring costs.

Total GAAP revenues in Q3 were at record levels for the third consecutive quarter and $130.1 million compared to our guidance of 125 to $128 million and revenues of $111.4 million in Q2.

We had two 10% or greater customers in Q3 including Level 3 at 19% of revenue and Global Crossing.

Although we had expected an increase in revenues from Level 3 in the quarter, their contribution was significantly higher than we had expected and included a large number of higher margin TAMs.

This upside was somewhat tempered by lower than expected bookings in the month of September.

International revenues amounted to $35.7 million or 27% of total revenues for the quarter.

EMEA accounted for $20.3 million or 16% of this amount with the balance coming from the other Americas and Apac.

Our services revenue for the quarter increased to $13.5 million versus $11.7 million in Q2.

Services margins improved slightly to 54.2% compared to 53.1% last quarter but remained below historical levels due to a higher mix of installation and deployment services.

Overall gross margins in Q3 were 51% versus 44% in Q2.

This compares to our guidance of 45 to 47%.

As mentioned above, we experienced strong demand for TAMs from Level 3 in the quarter, the total TAM shipments in excess of 3000 units.

This increase in TAM mix had a favorable impact of approximately 3.5% on overall gross margins for the quarter.

In addition, we [required] a lower than expected common equipment sales and this combined with favorable impacts from increased volume and cost improvements contributed to the remainder of the gross margin improvement experienced in the quarter.

We had added two new customers in the quarter for a total customer roster of 77 and expect to add at least three new customers in Q4.

One of the new customers added in Q3 was a new ATN-only customer.

In addition, we completed five new ATN deployments with existing customers, bringing our total ATN customer count to 15.

We continued our focus on expenses.

Operating expenses for the quarter were $48.1 million versus our guidance of $49 million to $50 million and versus $46.3 million in Q2.

The better-than-expected performance was partly attributable to the timing of certain non-recurring engineering expenses or NRE and prototype charges and from lower than expected SG&amp;A expenses.

We expect 1 million of the NRE charges to roll into the fourth quarter.

Overall headcount for the quarter was 1040 versus 1028 in Q2.

Most of the headcount additions occurred in R&amp;D with a few targeted additions in sales and marketing.

Operating income for Q3 was $18.5 million.

Other income and expense for Q3 was a favorable $0.5 million.

Net income for the quarter was $18.7 million resulting in earnings per diluted share of $0.18 versus our guidance which calls for earnings of $0.07 to $0.10 per share and versus earnings of $3 million in Q2.

Now turning to the balance sheet.

Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and investments ended the quarter at $288.1 million versus $279.6 million in Q2.

We generated $10 million of cash from operations in Q3 versus $11.2 million in Q2.

DSOs were at 45 days, same as in Q2.

Inventory turns were 2.9 versus 3 in Q2.

This mainly reflects the ongoing impact of holding increased levels of inventory to protect against constraints in the supply chain.

We expect to begin reducing inventory levels in the fourth quarter.

Accounts payable days were 52 days, up from 42 in Q2.

Capital expenditures were $5.9 million in Q3 versus $5 million in Q2.

Now turning to our Q4 outlook.

We are entering Q4 with less visibility than in recent quarters.

Backlog levels exiting Q3 were similar to where we were at the beginning of the year with bookings in September having slowed versus recent run rates.

We've included the impact of the three new customer wins in our revenue guidance.

However, this growth is offset by the fact that many of our existing customers have already completed significant network buildouts earlier this year and are not likely to drive incremental revenue in the December quarter.

While our sales pipeline of new deals remains strong, the outcome and timing for closure of these deals is not clear and would most likely not impact the fourth quarter.

In addition, we expect Level 3's contribution to both revenue and to margin from their TAM shipments to be lower than we experienced in Q3.

Although Q4 is normally a quarter where we might expect to benefit from some end of quarter budget flush, these amounts are typically unforecasted and any potential impact has therefore not been included in our Q4 guidance.

The combination of all these factors calls for revenue guidance just below our record Q3 10 performance which represents continued growth off of our Q2 and prior quarter numbers.

At this point, our gross margin outlook assumes TAM shipment of approximately 2400 units, in line with our previous discussion on the Q2 earnings call.

Common equipment sales will increase from Q3 levels with the completion of our new customer deployments.

Our previous guidance and operating expenses indicated that all things being equal, we would exit 2010 at an operating expense run rate in the mid-40 million range per quarter.

A number of items have occurred since we provided that guidance that impact the Q4 run rate as follows.

Our sales commissions run rate has increased by approximately $2 million per quarter due to revenue outperformance on a year-to-date basis.

In addition, we will continue to add targeted sales headcount in support of future revenue expansion.

Our R&amp;D run rate will be approximately $28 million reflecting the inclusion of $0.5 million to $1 million of OSMINE certification expenses needed to support future deployments at Qwest and $1 million of unspent NRE expenses rolling from Q3.

The following guidance for Q4 is based on non-GAAP results and excludes any non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.

Revenues of approximately 115 to 120, gross margins of approximately 45 to 47%, operating expenses of approximately $50 million to $51 million, operating and net income of approximately $2 million to $5 million.

Based on estimated average weighted diluted shares outstanding of 108 million, this would lead to EPS of approximately $0.02 to $0.05 per share.

Operator, would you now please open up the call for questions?

This document is on our corporate website at www.deckers.com.

You can access this document by clicking on the investor information tab and then scrolling down to the Featured Reports heading.

With that, I will now turn it over to Chief Executive Officer and Chair of the Board of Directors, Angel Martinez.

Good afternoon, everyone.

Thank you for joining us today.

With me on the call is Dave Powers, President of Deckers Brands; and Tom George, Chief Financial Officer.

Our fourth-quarter performance capped off a year of solid growth despite significant foreign exchange headwinds.

On a reported basis, revenue for the quarter was $340.6 million, an increase of 16% over last year, and ahead of guidance by approximately $15 million.

On a constant currency basis, revenue was up 19% from last year.

For FY15, revenue grew 15% to a record $1.8 billion, or 16% on a constant currency basis.

Our growth was fueled by the successful execution of key growth strategies for our brands, channels and geographies, all of which focused on winning with the consumer.

Let's begin with the UGG brand, where our strategy has been to develop a global year-round luxurious comfort brand with a diversified product offering.

This quarter, we further evolved the lifestyle nature of the Brandon through new product introductions aimed at broadening the brand's commercial appeal, diversifying the merchandise mix, and reducing the dependency on weather.

Our performance this past holiday season, when consumer demand for specialty classics, weather and casual boots outpaced supply, was a clear indication that our product strategy is working.

Similar trends played out with our wholesale accounts during the fall 2015 pre-book, which Dave will go through in more detail shortly.

HOKA ONE ONE is growing rapidly and is strategically important as it extends our reach into athletics, a market where we previously did not have a brand to build a business in.

Through great product design, we have quickly increased the penetration of women's to achieve parity with men's, while also expanding distribution beyond specialty running accounts into more mainstream retailers with larger geographic footprints.

The Teva brand is enjoying a resurgence in retail, thanks to the successful execution of our strategy to focus on the brand's roots as the original sports handle.

This shift in strategy has generated excitement among our new and former Teva consumers, garnered interest from other iconic brands that have led to exciting collaborations, and opened up new points of distribution including overseas, where Teva's share of the sports handle market is underpenetrated compared to the US.

Our strategy to evolve the Sanuk brand from primarily a men's surf brand into a global lifestyle brand continues to unfold.

This has been fueled by a heightened focus on women through innovative new products such as the brands yoga series of sandals and shoes which has opened up distribution with leading department stores and specialty retailers.

With the Ahnu brand, our strategy has been to cater to the modern women's active lifestyle.

In line with this strategy Ahnu recently launched a collection of performance-based YogaSport footwear that we believe further differentiates the brand in the market and represents an exciting new growth vehicle.

On the channel front, we continue to evolve our Omni-Channel capabilities to execute on our strategy to better serve our consumers wherever, whenever, and however they choose to engage with our brand.

The integration of stores and digital has reshaped the way we look at our geographic footprint.

The proliferation of technology is helping us determine the most effective way to reach consumers in each specific market and region.

We're also continuing to enhance consumer experience in-store and on our e-commerce sites, primarily through expanded functionality of programs like Infinite UGG, buy-online, return in-store, click and collect, and retail inventory online.

We believe the work we've done elevating the Omni-Channel experience is paying dividends, evidenced by the 8% DTC comp increase for FY15.

Outside the US, we made important changes to our operating structure to best capitalize on the many international opportunities we believe exist going forward.

This included moving to direct distribution in Germany, expanding our e-commerce presence in Asia, and reshaping our retail footprint by selectively opening locations in underpenetrated areas and transitioning some Company-owned stores in China to partner.

In the year to come, we are going to continue to build on these accomplishments.

The Company is rapidly evolving and growing, which is creating new opportunities for our brands and our organization.

With growth comes change and during the quarter we strengthened our leadership structure which we believe will benefit our long-term performance.

First, we elevated Dave Powers to the role of President of Deckers Brands.

Dave has demonstrated incredible leadership driving our Omni-Channel efforts and transforming our organization to be consumer focused.

In his new role as President, Dave will be able to drive greater cohesion between our brands, channels, and regions to ensure that we are best positioned to drive growth within each of our leading brands' respective categories.

Second, we recently appointed Wendy Yang President of Teva.

Wendy has an extensive background in footwear brand building, with experience at New Balance, Stride Rite, Timberland, Tommy Hilfiger and Reebok.

She joins us from New Balance, where she was a general manager of New Balance athletic shoe, overseeing the brand's $800 million lifestyle shoe business.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, we are losing an influential member of this organization as Connie Rishwain, President of UGG and Fashion and Lifestyle brands announced her decision to step down in July.

During Connie's 20-year tenure with Deckers, she spearheaded the brand's evolution from a Southern California apres surf brand into a $1.5 billion global lifestyle brand.

She is a true visionary, and thanks to our exceptional work, the UGG brand is well-positioned for continued success.

We wish Connie all the best in her future pursuits.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Powers.

Thank you, Angel.

As Angel said, we continue to execute on our strategy and had a successful quarter with positive growth coming from all brands and channels.

Our success in evolving the UGG brand spring line and weather collection, as well as growing contributions from Teva, Sanuk, and HOKA has made the fourth quarter increasingly important for the Company.

Beginning with our DTC performance, total DTC sales increased 14% driven by a5% comp increase, our 10th consecutive quarter of positive comps and solid contributions from the stores that we opened in the last year.

Our DTC gains were again driven by our e-commerce channel which increased 27% on a comparable basis.

Store comps improved versus third quarter trends but, nevertheless, were down mid-single digits due to decreased traffic and lower AUR, partially offset by hard conversion.

As a final reminder, beginning in FY16, we will no longer break out our store and e-commerce comp performance, and instead will only report on a combined DTC comp, as we believe this is the best way to evaluate the health of the channel now that stores and digital are so intertwined.

I'm now going to review UGG performance by region, with color on each of the major channel drivers.

Starting with North America, DTC comps were roughly flat compared to the same period last year.

The comp was helped by continued growth coming from e-commerce, and offset primarily by declines in sales at our tourist flagship-driven locations.

We continue to see strong US dollar impacting international tourist traffic to our Hawaii, Las Vegas, and New York stores.

These stores collectively represent a disproportionate dollar amount of both our North American and global comp base, so their underperformance has a significant effect on our comp figure.

The UGG brand's domestic wholesale business increased low single digits, fueled by sales of spring seasonal collections and winter weather boots.

We saw success in our spring sales with our key partners who invested this year more heavily in traditional spring product.

Demand for weather product was also very strong coming out of holiday.

In order to best capitalize on this in-season opportunity, we increased our use of air freight to avoid the delays caused by the West Coast Port slowdown.

Now to EMEA.

UGG delivered a strong quarter across the board, with growth in both our DTC and wholesale channels.

DTC comps increased high teens driven by e-commerce sales and a positive store comp.

Our new leadership in digital marketing efforts in the region have led to improved performance in our stores and e-commerce businesses.

Our success was also due to a sharper focus on developing compelling seasonal spring product, especially for the DTC channel.

Our decision to convert our German distributor to a subsidiary benefited our wholesale results and has proven very timely as we see a lot of opportunity to grow the UGG brand across all channels in this large and important market.

Turning to Asia-Pacific, which was our fastest-growing region during the fourth quarter, DTC comps increased low double digits, driven by strong e-commerce and store gains in Japan.

Our team continues to execute against our marketplace strategy in Japan with our men's business being particularly strong.

Our success in men's was driven this past quarter by our men's Treadlite collection, which was a big part of our spring marketing campaign.

In China, the team is making progress, working through the merchandising and allocation issues that impacted the third quarter.

The DTC team here in California is continuing to provide additional support as we build up our regional team in Shanghai.

We are confident the adjustments we've made to the product offering and our allocation of merchandising planning will lead to improved performance in our Company-owned stores this fall.

With regards to our expansion strategy in China, the current plan is to shift more heavily towards partner-operated doors.

At the end of FY15, there were 23 partner-operated UGG stores in China, which included the seven owned stores that were transferred during the year.

For FY16, we expect the number of partner doors to roughly double, mostly through new store openings but will likely conclude a few more company-owned transfers.

For our own stores, we're temporarily slowing the number of new store openings in the most of our regions as well for FY16.

The current plan is to open 16 net new stores globally compared to the 30 new stores opened in FY15.

Of the 16, nine are outlets and seven are concepts, with all of the concepts planned for the Asia-Pacific region, mostly in Japan where the brand is performing extremely well.

This year we are focusing more of our investments on technology to drive increased consumer engagement.

We are confident this strategy will help fuel growth going forward, and maintain our healthy DTC operating margins.

Moving over to UGG, for this year's backlog we were strategically focused on quality and diversity when pre-booking fall.

As we outlined in our Q3 call in January, many of our wholesale customers sold out of their non-classic inventory midseason, which led to missed replenishment opportunities during the holidays.

When planning for this upcoming season, we wanted to ensure that our retail partners were better positioned to capitalize on consumer demand.

We are pleased to share that based on the strength of our fall and holiday 2015 line, we successfully shifted our women's core classics business from roughly 33% of UGG revenue to under 25%, with growth coming from specialty classics, weather, casual boots, slippers and other categories.

With this in mind, I'm pleased with our results which show global UGG backlog at March 31 up slightly in constant currency with domestic orders up mid single digits, offset primarily by the decline in Europe where our distributors' buying power has been reduced due to the strong US dollar.

Total Company backlog was up low single digits in constant currency.

Given the change in the makeup of the UGG brand's fall order book, it's helpful to understand why the makeup of this year's order book gives us greater confidence in the outlook for our wholesale business in FY16, and how this shift will impact our business going forward.

Since retailers have pre-booked fewer classics than in the past, we now have the ability to use our classic inventory to chase demand in season.

This strategic shift in the makeup has also reduced the risks of cancellations since classics tend to have a higher cancellation rate than our other collections due to their sales sensitivity to cold weather.

Our sales teams did an excellent job working with our wholesalers and we're excited about how this shift positions the UGG brand long-term in line with our new marketing emphasis on product launches.

Now to the performance of our other brands.

The repositioning of Teva to be more relevant to women and to attack the casual and sports sandals categories is paying dividends.

Teva continues to generate strong consumer enthusiasm with its originals collection and originals derivatives, which are opening up new distribution and specialty accounts in family footwear chains.

These collections, including the newly introduced platform original sandal and our strategic collaborations have generated significant buzz in the marketplace and are helping us expand our presence within existing partners such as Nordstrom's and Urban Outfitters.

The same is true on our international markets where the refreshed product, along with concerted marketing efforts, are driving growth and expansion into lifestyle retailers in EMEA and AIPAC.

Moving to Sanuk, consistent with our strategy the brand has officially expanded beyond core surf distribution into key wholesale accounts like Journeys and Tilly's, as well as all doors at Nordstrom's.

This has allowed Sanuk to reach a wider female-driven audience.

As a result, the Sanuk business is now more balanced with 50% of its sales coming from women.

Demand for the brand's newer non-core offering has grown significantly, led by the women's yoga sandal collection which is selling through at double-digit percentage rates on a weekly basis this spring.

On the men's side, our efforts to gain share in the casual shoe category are bearing fruit.

The Boulevard collection, the brand's first casual shoe offering, has quickly become the second best selling men's collection on sanuk.com, behind only the brand's iconic Sidewalk Surfer collection.

The brand's expanded distribution, strong digital trend, as well as a more robust product offering that now includes casual shoes, positioned the brand well to compete in the large casual sandal and shoe market against key players such as Tom's and Havainas.

Now to HOKA, which is having great topline success and recently exceeded $50 million in sales in FY15.

This is a remarkable achievement for a brand that has only been in the market for a few years and operates in the highly competitive running industry.

HOKA's share of the neutral christening space in the specialty and running channel is now larger than several well-known brands like New Balance and Adidas.

What's also remarkable about HOKA's rapid growth is the fact that until recently distribution was limited to the specialty running channel which is highly fragmented and made up of primarily independent stores and small regional chains.

HOKA recently began initial expansion into more mainstream running and sporting good retailers like Sports Authority, and Finish Line, which opens up the brand to a much wider audience.

Product innovation continues to be the key growth driver and this year HOKA will release updates to award-winning styles such as the Clifton and the Bondi, while also expanding into new footwear categories, including hiking, where we believe the brand's oversized [UGG sole] will provide to be an attractive and differentiating feature at retail.

HOKA is now a credible and meaningful player in the running community with strong acceptance by female runners.

This acceptance and expansion beyond ultra-running gives us confidence in our aggressive growth plans for the brand.

As you just heard, each of our brands is starting the new fiscal year with solid momentum, driven by a combination of compelling new products, and select new points of distribution.

We are confident that we have the right teams, plans and processes in place to capitalize on the many opportunities we believe lie ahead.

Looking forward, I want to address the opportunity that I see ahead of us in my new role.

My focus will be on leveraging the strength of our Deckers Brand portfolio to drive sustainable growth and profitability, create synergy across the organization, and continue to evolve our Omni-Channel capabilities in DTC operations.

We will prioritize consumer engagement and digital marketing capabilities for all of our brands.

We will leverage the authenticity and strength of our emerging brands to attack meaningful categories globally, create new distribution opportunities, and improve overall operating margin.

Simultaneously we will continue to build on the global lifestyle offering of our flagship UGG brand to drive continued growth across all channels and regions with a strong focus on the evolutions of our classics category and expansion of casual and winter boots as well as men's and lounge wear.

Finally, I want to announce that we've recently acquired the Koolaburra brand, a sheepskin and wool-based footwear brand with current product silhouettes that mimic the UGG Classic and certain derivatives.

We plan to quickly reposition Koolaburra over the next 12 months to enter the mid-TM market.

This is a highly strategic acquisition for us that will allow us to compete in this market while maintaining the premium positioning of our UGG brand.

We plan to leverage our design and development expertise as well as our key and current relationships to bring Koolaburra to market.

We are very excited about this new addition to our brand portfolio and its potential to expand our addressable market.

The current health of all our brands, the strength of our franchise styles, distribution expansion opportunities, and the evolution of our DTC model gives me great confidence in our ability to drive healthy growth and profit for FY16 and beyond.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom George.

As a reminder, we posted a commentary on the quarterly financials and a bridge to our FY16 guidance to our website under the investor information tab.

Revenue increased 16% to $341 million in the fourth quarter.

In constant dollars, revenue was $351 million, up 19% from last year.

All brands posted solid revenue growth with UGG up 10%, Teva up 13%, Sanuk up 28%, and HOKA up 80%.

Our revenue in the quarter exceeded guidance by $15 million.

This upside was driven primarily by approximately $9 million in our DTC channel and $6 million from our wholesale and distributors.

For the year, revenue grew 15% to $1.8 billion.

In constant dollars, revenue was 16% higher for the year.

The increase in revenue was driven by double-digit growth for all brands, aided by higher e-commerce sales, the conversion to direct distribution in Germany, and the additional retail stores.

Gross margin was 44.7% in the fourth quarter, compared to 48.9% last year, and versus our assumption of 47.2%.

The largest component of the change on a year-over-year basis was driven by FX headwinds from the strengthening of the US dollar.

The difference versus our guidance was partially due to changes in FX, a higher proportion of closeouts, and higher air freight charges in order to avoid the West Coast port delays.

The closeouts include the liquidation of TSUBO inventory, which was worth about 60 basis points.

For the year, our gross margin was 48.3%, compared to 47.7.

We had approximately 120 basis point increase in gross margin, primarily due to lower input costs, a greater mix of the business from DTC, and the Germany conversion.

These gross margin tailwinds were offset by a 60 basis point FX headwind, due to the strengthening dollar.

SG&amp;A was 44.5% of sales in the fourth quarter, slightly better than expected due to higher sales combined with lower incentive compensation expense, compared to 49.1% a year ago.

For the year, SG&amp;A was 36%, compared to 34.8% a year ago.

For the quarter, we earned $0.04 per share, versus an $0.08 loss a year ago.

This was ahead of our guidance for breakeven and was driven by higher revenue partially offset by lower planned gross margin.

For the year, the Company earned $4.66 per share, compared to $4.07 a year ago, representing an increase of 14.5%.

During the quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $73.45, for a total of $93.9 million under its stock repurchase programs.

As of March 31, 2015, the Company had used all of the authorized repurchase funds under its $200 million stock repurchase program announced in July 2012, and had $172.1 million authorized repurchase funds remaining under its $200 million stock repurchase program announced in January 2015.

Now to guidance.

For the full FY16, we expect constant currency revenues to increase approximately 10.5% over FY15 levels.

On a reported basis, based on current rates, we expect revenues to increase 8%, which is consistent with the preliminary guidance we provided back in January for high single digit growth.

Included in our topline reported revenue assumption is global wholesale and distributor growth of 6%, which includes UGG domestic wholesale growth of 7%, DTC comps in the low single digit range, and the addition of 16 new stores.

On a reported basis by brand, we expect to Teva to grow 9%; Sanuk to grow 11%; HOKA to grow 74%; and UGG to grow 5% to 6%.

In constant currency, UGG growth would be 8% to 9%.

With respect to gross margins, due to the strengthening of the US dollar since the end of January, we now expect gross margins to be approximately 48% in FY16, compared with FY15 gross margins of 48.3%.

The changes in guidance are due to foreign currency which is reducing gross margins by 130 basis points, partially offset by 50 basis point of improvement from lower sheepskin cost, including the benefit from UGG Pure and 50 basis points improvement from the increased penetration of our DTC channel.

SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales is projected to be 35.8% for the full year, which equates to 20 basis points of leverage compared with FY15.

This is slightly below our previous forecast for 40 basis points of leverage, due to the fact that SG&amp;A for FY15 came in under planned by roughly 20 basis points as the result of lower incentive compensation expense.

As a reminder, most of the leverage for the year will be achieved in the back half of the fiscal year.

For the full year, constant currency EPS is projected to be $5.60, representing an increase of 20%.

On a reported basis, EPS is projected to be $5.09, representing an increase of 9% over FY15 EPS of $4.66, which is roughly $0.05 ahead of the initial guidance we provided in January.

The improved outlook is driven by a lower share count, as a result of our recent repurchase activity, partially offset by the impact on gross margins from the stronger US dollar.

Our guidance is based on a weighted diluted share count for FY16 of approximately 33.9 million shares and a 27% tax rate.

CapEx for FY16 is projected to be roughly $65 million to $70 million, with $10 million towards the buildout of our Marino Valley distribution center, $12 million in business transformation investments, $20 million in maintenance CapEx, and $25 million in DTC infrastructure related to new store openings in the e-commerce investments.

For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be relatively flat compared with the same period a year ago on a reported basis and up slightly on a constant currency basis.

We expect a diluted loss per share of approximately $1.52 on both reported and constant currency basis, compared to a diluted loss per share of $1.07 last year.

As a reminder, significant amount of our operating expenses are fixed and spread evenly on an absolute dollar basis throughout each quarter.

I'll now turn it back over to Angel for his closing comments.

All in all, FY15 was a solid year.

We delivered midteens top- and bottom-line growth, even in the face of some stiff foreign exchange headwinds.

However, I believe the most important takeaway was the success of our new collections, and the progress diversifying our mix of business from both a product and channel perspective.

These are themes we will build on in the coming year.

At the same time, we're incorporating important learnings from the past 12 months into our planning and execution that will help drive improved performance going forward.

We're on track and fully committed to leveraging the investments we have made over the past several years, to expand operating margins, which along with our current repurchase authorization will fuel increased value for our shareholders.

To close, I want to thank the entire Deckers Brand team for delivering such a strong performance.

This organization's ability to quickly adapt to the many changes we've encountered during the past few years is one of the greatest strengths of this organization and why I continue to be so confident about the future.

And with that, let me turn it over to the operator for the Q&amp;A session.
