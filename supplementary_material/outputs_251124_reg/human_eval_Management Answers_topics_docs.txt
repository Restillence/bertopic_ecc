H. KOTZ:
  Well, I think, we're looking at definitely improving the margins. There were a couple of contributors that had a particularly significant impact on lowering the margins over the last few quarters. The key ones we obviously spoke about, KSNET's experience, a bit of a margin squeeze as a result of the introduction of the new regulations in Korea and also the no CVM authentication for transactions less than $50. And as you know, KSNET score consists significant contributor overall to both the revenue and the operating margin lines. I think that's now stabilized, then we'll also anniversary out over the next few quarters. The Masterpayment book, obviously, had a very low-marginal impact on us. So the removal of that business should result in our margins improving. And I think the continued focus on costs and the management of the group overheads over the next 12 months, there's obviously an active and conscious attempt to make sure that those are well controlled. It will also result in an improvement in margins. So from my perspective, going forward for the next 6 to 12 months, I believe that we can get our margins back to where we used to see them a couple of years ago.

R. BROOKS:
 Looking at a longer basis, Sharon, what I would say to your question is that we look at it, and we expect that we should see incremental improvement every year, and I guess a way to benchmark it or ballpark it for you is to say that there is nothing structural. If you wanted to benchmark our business against our competitors, I don't see any reason structurally that we can't achieve similar operating margins. Now, it may come from different reasons, right, because of the nature of our business being some branded business and, again, private label is not as big a part of our business as it is for most of our competitors, but I think you'll see us find other ways to squeeze a margin out. So I don't see any structural reasons. We want to see achieve similar margins to other specialty retailers that carry branded products.

S. PELTZ:
 Yes. So remember, when we talked about this as first, we talked about the discussion with the FDA, which was that they want -- really, the 1 thing that we didn't have was that in their mind, the dystrophin level in the way that they wanted them to do and to do that experiment. But they did have -- they did look at our data. They looked at both the extensive, critical and safety -- safety data that we have as well as the efficacy over the trials that we've done. That's why at the end of the day, what they told us is that the dystrophin levels, that all that it has to be is over -- is the -- it has to be above the background. That's -- and it has to be statistically significant.
 And that, along with the clinical data that we have is -- would be sufficient for accelerated approval with [7 41] after completion would be then for full approval. And I think that is appropriate as you think about other companies that they've gotten approved on dystrophin alone without any sort of data of clinical benefit. So I think we have the combination, hopefully, with the results that come out that we'll see dystrophin data that, along with the clinical data that we have, will actually be a nice strong path to get those both clinical benefit as well as the dystrophin data. And then we have the trial that's ongoing, that would be for full approval.

  Right. Yes, so from our preclinical data, I mean, we -- the drug is highly soluble and distributes well within animals. So we have every reason to expect that we will be able to achieve sufficient exposure. I think it's worth noting that in patients, CF patients who were treated with high levels of oral or IV arginine, there were positive effects on lung function as well as on NO production in that setting. And so in that case, at least arginine is able to get into the right place, and we would expect CB-280 will be as well.

G. MATTYS:
  So the high-diagnosing facilities, Mitra, if I'm understanding your question correctly, those facilities vary depending upon when we pull the claims data. So in other words, when we did the data pull in the middle of 2016, there were fewer high-diagnosing clinician groups than when we did the data pull at the end of 2018. So there is not a really an apples-to-apples comparison I can give you. We came in to 2018 thinking we had penetrated about 40% of then existing high-diagnosing accounts. And we left 2018 thinking, we were a little -- we were right around 50%. So we picked up another 10%. The problem is that the denominator increased as well. So the number of accounts increased. Now it's 4,700 high-diagnosing facilities in the U.S. Almost half are doing business with us today, which means that 2,300 aren't. So we see this is as a very fertile call point for us as we continue our expansion into this $4 billion market opportunity.

M. SOUZA:
  Yes. So thank you so much, Peter, for the questions. So first on TEGSEDI and what do we expect after the approval, which is upcoming from ANVISA. Obviously, that is 2 process, right, as we've described before. One is the individual patient's requests that would be called the name patient sales, and that should continue to be requested by the patients and approved individually. And you might have seen that we got the first patients in the region reimbursed, which we feel really proud off. And that's going to probably be anywhere between the U.S. price and the European price based on the negotiations with the government.
 Now we have submitted for, as is requested now by the regulation there, a price to be commercialized in the country. We fully expect that there's going to be some negotiation once it's approved and then there is a cap what it's called. That is a discount that is applied on top of that of around 20%. So it's going to be a reduction on the overall price that is normally anchored to the United States FSS price. So there is some reduction there. It's going to be accounted for. We fully accounted for that in our internal projections on the model in the guidance for 2023 that we gave of $150 million for the product. Identification of patients and the lining up has been quite positive. So we see the launch late this year and next year to be, while patient by patient in this first phase to be quite productive and positive for PTC.
 In terms of the contribution of the region for the overall mix of the company, as Emily mentioned, we did receive a large order for Translarna which we're extremely proud of because it means that patients can have continuity of access, and it's for the entire year. So we know that it becomes a little bit more irregular, although still fairly lumpy in terms of the size of the orders, slightly irregular in terms of patients receiving it. It's an important region for us, but it's not the biggest region in the world for Translarna. So again, trying to balance the general demand globally, while giving the emphasis there of all patients being on drug.

 So with respect to our current guidance that we've shared with you recently with respect to our expectations for 2013, you can be sure that we have modeled in a couple of scenarios relative to OPANA ER. We do not again believe that there will be a therapeutically equivalent product on the market. And even if we do believe that any product that would be launching into this space has to face into some other hurdles relative to the DEA quota allocation, and all of those factors need to be factored into what impact, if any, a generic product would have on OPANA ER. We also believe strongly in the value proposition of the new formulation designed to be crush resistant. And we believe that we can continue to have high expectations for OPANA ER relative to the current regulatory and legal environment.

 And this is an area where we recognize the value and importance of this franchise for us, so we are very appropriately allocating our sales and marketing spend to support the growth trajectory of this franchise going forward. It is a growth opportunity for us over many, many years given the strength of our intellectual property position that goes out through 2029. Were a generic to come to market, again we believe it would be n on-A-B rated as Julie has indicated, and we think that it would not meaningfully impact our revenue trajectory.

S. ROMBOTIS:
  Thank you, Jonathan. I appreciate your question. The short answer is that we are very much aware of the value that patients and physicians ascribed to oral therapy, especially during an unveiling global pandemic still evolving, and we're, therefore, very keen to begin oral evaluation of fadraciclib. In regard to the dosing schedule, clearly, it's an oral drug that gives us more flexibility in being able to dose at different dosing schedule that an IV therapy would permit, and therefore, we treat the results of the IV program as supportive, but not relevant necessarily with what we could achieve with oral dosing other ones or twice a day for continuous days. That schedule is yet to be refined upon initiation of relevant studies, but we are clearly responding to also the nation's requests for oral therapeutics, and the drug has high overlapping PK, which clearly does.

 Sure, Ritu, this is Scott again. I don't know that we have seen any trends in discounting. We haven't increased or made any changes to the pricing of the vial, so that is pretty stable. In terms of the number of vials per patient, we -- with the data that we have available to us, and it's a little bit further in arrears than our sales data are -- it's not a realtime metric. But we have seen really nice strength in the average number of vials per patient. We think the range is still within that, that we talked about in the press release and in our prepared remarks.
 But I do feel good that our current efforts are going to build on the strength we were seeing in 2011, specifically buoyed by our increased focus on calling on surgeons -- who, as you may remember, are responsible for pain management as the patient moves out of the OR and PACU and moves up on to the floor. So, they are key -- the surgeons and their staffs are key to getting these patients to stay on therapy for the entire time that they are not taking oral, and we are seeing some benefit of that now.

J. FRANTZ:
 Yes, absolutely. So with our current pop up offerings, one of the things we have is the Mirth care platform, which is a great platform for cohort identification and really managing gaps in care. However, the analytics suite was not our strongest asset and therefore, it was not identifying the places to use some of our pop health assets. By bringing in EagleDream, which has been developed by somebody who truly understands the population health market, truly understands value-based care but also truly understands how to find gaps in care, we now have something that we can identify the population that needs the most help. On top of that, as we move forward, we really see the ability to really bring those 2 things together, along with Entrada into a really powerful combination that not only identifies problems but truly allows those problems to be addressed. So we looked across the market for a while, and I'm an engineer by training. It's interesting. Engineers as a general rule tend to write a lot of reports by looking at the data and figuring out what reports they can write. A physician who is truly responsible for closing gaps in care instead looks at the client use case and then figures out how to bring just the right data necessary to support the insights to truly make changes. So it becomes much more of a client use case-oriented solution. When we saw EagleDream, we looked at what they can bring out of the box. We talked to some of their clients and frankly, they're doing a phenomenal job, and we think a better job than almost anybody else in the industry. So we're very excited about that.

 Well, it does introduce some volatility to our margin percentage. When I referenced those quarters, it's because normally that's when we have movement in our inventory. It so happens that in this quarter, we had a growth in inventory of about 8%. So any time you have a growth in inventory, you are going to advance those low margin revenues, and decrease your margin expense. And that's exactly what happened this quarter.

 Thanks for that, Eric, and so I'll just start out and then I'll pass it on to Mark. Clearly we have a lot of pricing and reimbursement discussions going on that are based on our Phase 2B data and in the midst of that, then I'll have Mark talk about that as well. As in terms of the German -- as Mark alluded to, I think we'll talk a bit about part of this is the clear path to allow patients to maintain access of the drug at what we think is the most fair and sustainable price, and he can talk a bit about that.
 So maybe I'll pass that on to you, Mark. Just to clarify that.
M. ROTHERA:
 As you're aware we're already selling Translarna in 23 countries and there are six countries where we've already been through the pricing and reimbursement negotiations and have a commercial price. So there isn't a contingency around the CHMP decision that's expected here.
 With regard to Germany, there is a path as I mentioned that enables patients to have access to essential medicines that aren't available on the German market. The drug is approved in Germany, it can be promoted in Germany, it can be prescribed in Germany, but by choosing to de-list what we're avoiding is a list price at a level that we believe is unsustainable and we're enabling patients to request authorization of the drug through importation.
 And just to remind you, the GBA, which is the health technology assessment body in Germany, already opined on the value of Translarna and gave the drug a rating of three on a scale of one to six where one is the highest and six is the lowest. About 50% of orphan drugs that go into the German HTA process get a four or a non-quantifiable benefit, whereas Translarna was given a three or a quantifiable benefit. So when it comes to patients requesting access to the drug, not only is it a drug that the insurers will see have been given a three from a medical value perspective but it's the only approved drug for what is a very life-threatening condition.
 I guess the final thing to say around this is that the GKV appear to have taken a tough stance. It seems contextual. I don't know if you saw their press release of 21 January, but they're really pushing hard on orphan pricing and the GBA value assessment at this time, and I think we're caught up in that situation.

 I can't give you the numbers yet. But I would tell that our sales teams had proactive calls from EqualLogic channel partners who wanted to talk to us about being a Compellent business partner. So that's a real positive for us and that's been proactive in them calling us. So that's a good sign there.
  And it's not one or two it's quite a few. I don't think they will run away from EqualLogic necessarily but I think they're saying I have got to maybe look at some alternatives. And I think our market presence is saying that we have a very good solution that does everything that the EqualLogic solution did plus a lot more with things like automated tiered storage and some of the ways we do replication etcetera. You can notice it but I don't know the exact numbers there, Tom.

From a pro forma standpoint, we haven't closed what those balances are. But what I can tell you is we did use a certain amount of cash for the transaction. So as of June 30, the cash balance was $290 million, and a portion of that cash was used to fund part of the transaction and transaction fees.

 Thanks for that question, and we'll let George handle that.
G. YANCOPOULOS:
 All right, Phil. Well, we do think not all inhibitors are made the same nor do they act the same, and as you know, all these features that you talked about, which are affinity, particularly hitting one receptor and a component of the receptor system that will block, essentially, with very high affinity both cytokines. It hits both type I and type II receptors.
 There's a lot of differentiation on the biochemistry, which we can't get into the details here. But it just is a testament to the fact that it you create a good antibody with all the right properties -- not all antibodies are the same. Not all the technology is the same. You may end up achieving better results in the clinic.

S. PELTZ:
  Yes. Sure. So maybe we'll start with the dystrophin measurement. That was one, obviously, when we've had substantial discussions with the FDA on this. And it wasn't one where we said that -- in essence, we actually -- I remember I was discussing first saying how I'm sure you would want a Western blot. And they said, no, not really, and I assumed they don't like Western blot. They understand the limitations of those. If you have a better assay, we'd be interested. And so we had been working on, and we have been using in our own laboratories this unique form of an ELISA with ECL. And so -- and they like that.
 So they -- we worked with them, and Marcio and the team had worked for quite some time. And so maybe why don't you talk a little bit about sort of the -- it was sort of a 6- to 8-month interaction, and they were pretty much pleased, I think, very much with the work and the sensitivity. I mean I think they're very excited about this assay.
M. DE'SOUZA:
  That's right. So we worked very closely with the FDA and specific officers there on the validation of the assay, and they are completely on the same page as we are in terms of the measure itself, right? Obviously, the results we're going to see after the trial. It reads the results soon, but the assay itself and the sensitivity and the way it was validated was, obviously, a concern, I would say, in general, from us and from the FDA from the beginning because this is full and this is certainly very different than what others were doing. We had to have an external standard. Once you are doing the ECL, the external standard has to be hyperpure and so on. So we did all this work with them and to the satisfaction of the agency and obviously, ourselves as well.
 We decided to use a third-party lab to do this to eliminate any potential bias that an internal lab could add to such measure, not unblinded study. So that was how we done it. Again, I think we're all pleased. It took a very long time to validate and to discuss with the agency, but we're on the same page now.
S. PELTZ:
  Yes. And in terms of the risdiplam in terms of the broad label, I think we're -- in terms of the having FIREFISH and SUNFISH and the part -- that was part 1. But part 2, I think both of them actually help really understand further the drug itself and how effective it can be.
 I think in terms of the SUNFISH trial, really, it's hard to compare because considering that no one else has done a 2- to 25-year-old trial with -- in such a broad label, broad inclusion criteria, that we have patients with scoliosis, with Hammersmith baseline scores less than 10. And I should point out that those -- in the real-life patients, even in the 2- to 5-year olds, 20% of the patients had Hammersmith scores of less than 10, and there was also scoliosis and of contractures.
 And so you're really going to have a hard time. So we're pretty excited of the fact that there was a statistically significant improvement in this broad population. And we think that gives us a leg up and that no one else has this data when you talk not only to physicians, but to your payers that you've actually studied the types of patients that you're going to be treating. And in fact, no one else has that. I think in terms of -- when you think about FIREFISH -- and FIREFISH, I think, if there's anything for comparable, I think that becomes clearer. And I think in terms of looking at age is probably the most determinative thing where you could see. And I think you can look at the risdiplam data, and patients of greater than 5 months of age, you still saw increases in CHOP-INTEND. And that wasn't seen in other trials as well. So at the end of the day, I think when you're going to compare -- if you want to do a comparison, those are the closest, and you could look at the other trials, and they have basically far younger patients than what we saw, and yet we saw very strong data, not only in the early patients but also, though, in the Type 1 patients that were even older. And so we're pretty happy about that, and we look forward to actually talking far more about that at the AAN. So I feel pretty strongly that risdiplam is a highly efficacious drug that will be used quite broadly in the population.

S. BENNETT:
 I think the competitive dynamics are a lot different on the Web. And I'm thrilled with the progress we made this year with the new line-up. We were more competitive at the low end. We won with a free Federal TurboTax offering, where we were able to get money from state and other things. So I think we will continue to evolve our thinking. I think this was a huge breakthrough this year, to offer TurboTax free on the Web and have minimal cannibalization. That was something that the first time that I gave Brad Henske and Dan Maurer all the credit in the world for that. They did a bunch of tests, and found that the cannibalization, even when it was on TurboTax.com with all the offerings, and we had limited cannibalization. So we really played offense. I think it's the single most significant learning we've had in Consumer Tax in the last ten years, that we could offer for a free product, and it didn't really cannibalize our full-priced offerings, and actually helped us hold share and grow the category. So I think that was a big learning, and you'll see some new things from us like that in the future.

 Obviously, the numbers speak for themselves. We had a very strong turnaround in Goldline. I would say that it lagged a little bit to the other customers of ours or other numbers we see are participants in the market, I think Goldline started to really see some big improvement in their numbers in April. And I would say that currently, Goldline is continuing to show very strong performance as well as what we've found most encouraging is a very large percentage of their sales today are to new customers, something we really haven't seen in the last couple of years, the percentage of new customers is higher than we've seen.
 I think that the Goldline customer base is certainly in tune with the current stimulus and the incredible printing of money and the likelihood of some issues down the road as it relates to that as well as the Goldline customer base seems to be very focused on the election. And I think that what's going on in the pre-election months is certainly creating some anxiety with the Goldline customer base. But I -- we're all very pleased here. It was some hard work. We had a number of these calls over the last 1.5 years that weren't particularly positive as it relates to Goldline.
 But again, the work that the people there have done and the work we've done here at A-Mark in helping them to have product when nobody else had product and to have product that's a very good deal for their customers, has really -- has worked out, and we're super optimistic about Goldline going forward. We feel that our timing and sizing that business and getting our costs in line, even though it took a little longer than we had hoped. Our timing coming out of December into the new year was perfect, and they were tight, and they were in great shape to take advantage of the increased volatility in volumes in April. So very happy with Goldline right now.

  Yes. I'm going to just make some closing remarks here quickly. Again, I want to thank the Cooper team around the globe for their 2018 efforts. They delivered good results in a challenging environment, including 2 consecutive quarters of volume growth in the U.S., good progress on both our global OE and TBR businesses and a fourth quarter with year-over-year revenue growth and higher adjusted operating profit and margin. Looking forward, we expect improvement to full year operating profit margin, as we just described, as we continue to progress our strategic initiatives such as our retail expansion in the U.S., which will build on the successful dealer conquest program we had starting a year ago and continuing, by expanding into new channels and by partnering with new customers. At the same time, we are improving our manufacturing footprint and that includes our new TBR JV in Vietnam. So while the industry remains challenging, we are optimistic about how we are positioned at Cooper to compete. And with that, we will close it, and thank you for your participation today. Thank you.

A. HOOD:
 Thanks, Ed. Let me take those in reverse, actually. On the Office consumer performance, I will always, first and foremost think about the combination of Office 365 Home, as well as our consumer performance, and that grew obviously at a higher rate than 15%, that we talked about this quarter.
 That, and increasing attach. There were some dynamics this quarter that I think were important.
 Some stabilizing that we have seen in the consumer-developed world PC market also benefits, as you might imagine, our Office business. We have the highest attach rates in developed markets and so that tends to be an important driver of Office revenue, whether earned as a license or a subscription.
 The second thing is related a bit to your first question. These are hard to separate oftentimes, many of the dynamics in our market. As we have seen Windows Pro mix increase.
 For example, in small business, when people buy PCs with Windows Pro, they're more likely to purchase a form of Office, whether it be a subscription or a license. That's another dynamic you saw this quarter.
 A final dynamic that I'll talk about relating to Office was around Japan. We did see some pull-forward due to the end -- to the tax increase. That did have an impact on Office consumer growth, but even without that, as we talked about, we still had increasing attach, and very good performance for the quarter.
 Now, backing up, because it's complicated, was the Windows sustainability in the business segment. As we said, it's very hard to separate cleanly the impact of XP from what is an improving business PC refresh cycle, as well as some positive macro economic trends that we're seeing. So, as I said in my comments, the end of XP does create a bit of a moderation in growth.
 That being said, the differentiation and value proposition of Pro is clearer than it has been. The investment in that SKU, and the value proposition of Pro has had mix increasing within segments of the market. For example, in small business and in the enterprise, for people who buy a Windows PC. And so I think that's an important dynamic, that we'll continue to invest in, and we're excited to see.

 Thank you, Jesse. We feel good about that. For those who are looking at the fact sheet, the total paying customers were up 23%. We saw healthy growth across the board. We saw QuickBooks Online subs at 41%. We saw the desktop customers growing 8%. If you look at those that are new to the franchise in QBO it was north of 80%, it was 84% this quarter.
 There's just healthy growth across the board. What's driving it is we're expanding the TAM. We're expanding the TAM in three ways. With the shift to the cloud and mobile, more people are now considering accounting software than they would have in the past because they can come in and try it for free and then sign up for it if it's actually improving their effectiveness.
 The second thing that's helping us is we're getting the opportunity to connect our products with other products like PayPal, American Express. That gives us more consideration. And last but not least is global expansion, which has opened up tens of millions of more prospects to our product that we couldn't have served a couple years ago. That's one big bucket. It's just expanding the TAM.
 The second is we did see a strong repurchase cycle in desktop this year. So the desktop units rebounded and it was primarily because we saw people who were coming at the end of their three-year cycle and they upgraded and they were able to buy the newest version of QuickBooks desktop and that gave us a little bit of bump here in the last half of this fiscal year. By and large, we do think this is sustainable. We've opened up the total addressable market. We think that cloud and mobile is going to help us. And we think there will be a group of customers that will still want be on desktop and we plan to have a great desktop product as well.

E. RIVERA:
 Yes. So let me talk about, first, kind of what have been the drivers in the first 6 months and then why third quarter looks a little bit different perhaps than sequentially than other quarters.
 And by the way, I would just ask for other people in the queue, if there's a question that's really kind of related to what we're discussing, if you could just sort of keep your questions brief because we want to try to get to everyone.
 So the short answer to your question on Management Solutions is that, Management Solutions has HR outsourcing in the ASO model in that revenue stream. It's got retirement services in that stream.
 Other module flex, including, and very importantly, time and attendance in that revenue stream and then some other items.
 All of those products are doing very well. And I would highlight the fact that if you look at the year, this has been the year of demand for HR services.
 So if you look at our worksite employees across all of our platforms that provide HR support, our worksite employees are up.
 So we've seen very strong demand driving the revenue growth or the revenue recovery. Now we're battling, as I mentioned in my comments, we're battling the fact that the number of employees paid is down obviously because of current unemployment.
 But the underlying trends are very, very positive. So why as we get into Q3, does that change? In Q3, there are a number of revenue streams that are billed annually and depend on the number of employees on the payroll at that point in time.
 Because they are lower, we anticipate as the number of worksite employees that are being paid, it has a moderating impact on the revenue in the third quarter. That's what's driving that result.
 Obviously, then as we come out of Q3, those revenue streams are no longer a factor in Q4, and we expect a rebound in Q4. So that's really what's driving the -- would appear to be conservatism in Q3.
 We like where the underlying trends are in all of the revenue streams on management solutions, and we see those continuing through the year into Q4.

 Thank you, Andrew. What we're seeing, as we've said, the trend line is showing positive. Our sales have increased within our advisor channel. We're seeing good uptake performance and our products are strong. We're actually coming out with more products as we continue to move through the year that we're seeing some good uptake on. Our redemptions are actually decreasing. We still have redemptions in what was the old New Dimensions Fund. The performance is turning around but we don't see that curtailing in a major way shortly, but it is improving. So that's why we're still continuing to be in outflows with the open architecture. The positive on that is with the sales increasing, the new funds, and now moving to our start to distribute our products externally, we're hoping that the amount of in flows will continue to increase. 
 We have two institutional mandates that came in the 2nd quarter. We also, as we've just said, have opened distributions to Security America advisors who never had the ability to sell our RiverSource Funds and we will be actually launching in the 3rd party distribution channel by the end of this quarter, which is the 3rd quarter. So as we move then into 2007, we are hoping that there's a momentum shift and then with the new activities coming up, we have a positive expectation as we move forward but I don't want to give any sort of projections out.

 Yes, we go back to Q3 of last year, you'll remember we mentioned that high healthcare costs within our PEO and it's a bit more specific to the PEO business, had impacted that business. And in the PEO business, you get one shot, it's either gain or lose clients. At the end of calendar year typically people are making that decision. We went in to that season with what we thought were pretty competitive rates. It turned out that they weren't as competitive as we thought, and PEO didn't have a good selling season in the third quarter. Having said that, two things I think are important, Tim, to remember about. The first is that the PEO is one part of a three-part offering.
  We talked about HR Essentials and we talked about the ASO. The ASO's doing very well and it's much larger than the PEO. And the way we have chosen to go to market is to say to a client, we offer you a variety of options in terms of how you want to handle your HR outsourcing and if an ASO offering is a better option for you, we'll go there. We're not steering you to the PEO option. Others in the market do something slightly different. What we found is that people are tending to go with the ASO option, even though fully loaded, the ASO and the PEO don't differ all that much in terms of cost. But for us at least, the PEO's performance has been very sluggish.

M. LOUGHRIDGE:
 Well, you know, when we look at the transformation in the business that we have been working so diligently on, really, I would say it's not overstating it to say for the last decade. I mean, our objective there was to exit businesses that were commoditizing, didn't have strong margin potential.
  But I think more importantly than that, it was businesses that didn't have good value proposition to our customer set. And that's what we're moving toward. So if you look at the money that we've spent buying those 108 acquisitions since the year 2000 for $22 billion, and you go down that, what you're going to see is those are big-value plays for our us, with better growth prospects.
  So, we're moving out of business that we don't think had the same growth prospects and don't have the same margin, and moving into businesses with better value contribution and better growth prospects that fit within a solution orientation.
  There's no better example than that than business analytics. And look at business analytics, we think that opportunity set could be as big as CRM or ERP. We'll see; but we put -- invested about $10 billion growth and that about $8.5 billion net acquiring 14 companies to build that capability. They weren't just add-on, bolt-on capabilities; it was really moving the Corporation into this higher growth, higher margin, to our customers, higher value opportunity space. And that's our objective.
  So I think it should add the compounded opportunity of moving into better growth with better margins. You can see that underneath as well, that net of strategic middleware within our Software business, is at one of our highest levels that we've ever had. And those strategic middleware products have, by their nature, better growth characteristics. So, a very good question.
  Let me take the opportunity now to just wrap up. So we feel very good about our performance this year. In fact, I'd say it was pretty remarkable, given the economic environment.
  We achieved 2010 EPS objective I'd say one year earlier. And I don't think I'm overstating it. When we look back at the comments that we all pulled together when they announced it in second quarter 2007, I think we -- that kind of validation that was achievable to get in that 10 to 11 by 2010; but to hit it one year early, I think, is pretty strong performance despite a two-year recession. As we look at 2010, we've guided to the high end of the range in at at-least characterization.
  All of this, consistent with the last question, was a result of the transformation that we began a decade ago. But it's also very good execution in using the flexibility in our business model to adapt to market conditions.
  The structural actions and continued investments throughout the downturn have us better positioned going into 2010 than 2009. We've got improved revenue growth performance; better operating leverage; a good set of opportunities in emerging markets, in areas like business analytics and Smarter Planet.
  So you put all of that together and we see another year of double-digit earnings growth in 2010 with at least $11 of EPS for the year.
  So, thank you very much for joining us today.

 Yes. So let me handle the first half and then the second half. So the short answer, Ramsey, is that no, it doesn't include the impact of any stimulus, a little bit tough to gauge, but it would be a net positive I'll let Marty talk to kind of what we think the benefit might be.
M. MUCCI:
 Yes. I think a number of -- obviously, a lot of clients have been kind of holding -- some clients have been holding on, waiting for a second stimulus. What we have found is that those who -- when we surveyed our clients, those who took a PPP loan the first time, virtually 100% of them were still in business, so 99.8% or something.
 So obviously, the stimulus, the first one made a big difference for holding clients over and until the spec back up. And I think the second one will do the same thing.
 And it's very targeted to small in kind of on the smaller end of mid sized businesses, which is even better and has better parameters from what we can see at least that was signed or approved by Congress forgiveness for loans as well.
 We also have done some things like made sure that we're totally connected now in with fintech providers and lenders like biz to credit. So we can pass our information from payroll, and they can -- clients can approve the fact that they can move information directly to a fintech provider like Vista credit to get a loan.
 So I think everything is going to speed up faster from a stimulus perspective. If you need a loan, you're going to easier, faster. The forgiveness is going to be even better than before, particularly if you're on the low end.
 And not to mention that I think payroll and HR solution services software is covered by the expenses are part of the expenses that can be covered. So I think it's going to be positive. Certainly, it's going to be positive, to the degree how much? It's hard to tell at this point.
