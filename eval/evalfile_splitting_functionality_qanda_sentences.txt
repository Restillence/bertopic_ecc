  (Operator Instructions)
 Our first question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Either Chris or Peter, just in looking at the guidance for the year, obviously, really good performance during Q3.

Guidance coming up a little bit for Q4 here -- for the full year, sorry, Q4 not changing much, an easier comp that you just saw here in Q3 -- here in Q4.

So just wanted to make sure there is not anything that we're missing from a system placement perspective?

A bigger bulk purchase in Q3?

Or anything along those lines that you're trying to signal here in Q4 that may weigh a little bit on the top line, even though it's still really good expected top line growth?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP &amp; CFO   [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes, thanks, Matt.

This is Peter.

I'll let Chris answer with some color commentary, so just to put closure to first part of your question, there is nothing unusual or any bulks or nuances that would influence that guidance one way or the other.

So I'll let Chris add some more commentary around Q4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

Matt, thanks for asking that question.

If you look at Q4, Q4 is one of our lowest quarterly growth rates year-over-year for treatment sessions.

Typically, what happens in Q4 is NeuroStar System sales are at the highest of the year.

And we're expecting terrific NeuroStar System sales in Q4.

Although we increased our CTCs, the increase in Q4 system sales provides a headwind to a pull-through efforts due to the higher number of installs and trainings required.

They're out there.

We're going to have to -- with the number systems expected in Q4, this will outstrip the CTC team and the CTC team will be involved in installs.

This happened again last year as well.

So there is a -- and there's also a couple of points of growth here.

In Q4, 2017, we benefited from the launch of the upgraded coil, and that's not going to occur this year.

But that's a couple of points of growth there as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay.

Very fair.

And then -- and obviously, the capital number was extremely strong this quarter.

Can you just deconstruct a little bit the performance among some of your more established reps versus some of the newer ones?

Because as I look at the numbers, versus what you did last year, there is -- I think there is an opportunity for the entire group to go up pretty meaningfully from a productivity per quarter perspective not -- they're not trending very well right now.

But is that a fair assessment?

Or just again, can you just kind of deconstruct the older reps versus the ones that you recently brought on board?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes, yes.

So good question.

So our model, the way we think about it is, as we add reps and as they mature, they become more productive.

And that typically occurs somewhere between 12 and 18 months they hit their stride and their performance is higher.

And so when you look at our hiring, we did a fair bit of hiring in the fourth quarter of last year, and then we paced it early part of this year.

On a weighted average Matt, we actually have slightly less experienced reps in Q4 of this year than we actually did in Q4 of last year.

So -- and then there is generally not a cliffing or a binary event that takes place, it's gradual over time.

So the productivity on a quarter-over-quarter basis is actually lower.

But our full-time equivalents are up almost 80-plus percent versus this time last year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Got it.

And last one for me.

And I know it's really early, but I'm just a little bit curious about the impact of the CTCs on the CPCs?

Anything you can provide just a little bit of color, again, I get it's early as far as the impact that those folks are having on your treatment session business.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

So it's difficult, Matt.

I mean, the way to solve for that empirically is that we don't do any other activities in the field like BDM expansion, the marketing and soft target and high-value targets, just to track kind of what happens with those CTCs, that's a difficult exercise and not in the best interest of the business.

I think more intuitively, this time last year the CPCs were doing all the training.

This year, we have 11 full-time bodies doing all of the training.

And as I mentioned in the last call, that gave us really good leverage in Q1, Q2 and Q3.

But that leverage starts to wane over the quarters.

And as we move into Q4, there is a big step-up here in system sales.

We have this 44-man army -- men and women army out there, who are really maturing, and we're expecting big things from them in Q4.

So I think they'll outstrip that leverage fortunately, unfortunately in Q4.

And then, we'll look to add more CTCs and CPCs here in the future.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  So first off, I was hoping to focus a little bit more on the utilization for active system, which for us by our math might even approach double-digit growth, which is quite strong.

So first, can you comment whether it reached double-digit growth?

And then second, maybe walk us through what could drive that as we go forward into Q4 and into 2019, especially, since it sounds like you're going to do a little bit more DTC study in Q4?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Right.

So we're really excited about the total NeuroStar treatment session revenue growth.

I mean this was a big step up and we've managed to improve quarter-over-quarter on that.

And then the other thing is, is we're selling a lot more systems, right?

So -- and those systems -- when we sell those systems, they don't really attribute to utilization very much in their first couple quarters.

So when you think about our NeuroStar treatment session utilization growing just north of 8% year-over-year with a 20% increase in the number of systems over prior year, I mean, that typically is dilutive to system utilization.

The fact that we can post high single-digit growth on a per unit basis, we're pretty proud of that right now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay.

So maybe just to key-in further kind of on various reasons for that and kind of the spending on the DTC.

So if you go on Google trends and you start to see all the hits coming up on NeuroStar, or on iSpot.tv you can see the amount of ads that are going out on you guys whether it's you or whether it's some of the local ads that are going around out there to your depression tour.

But can you walk us through kind of the revenue return per dollars spent?

How quickly we should see a return on that spending?

And then whether or not you guys can target your ads better now that you have a little bit more experience with it as well?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes -- no, thanks, Margaret.

Yes, so we qualified the first DTC campaign as a beta.

And we learned a fair bit.

We learned a couple things as it relates to the channels in which we were going to extend through meaning actually the TV channels.

And so we've actually modified this campaign based on those learnings.

We're actually going to fewer shows that are more closely targeted actually to depression audience.

We can get some research.

We have some research now, where people with depression tend to watch.

The second thing is, is operationally what we're doing this time is we found out that if a provider doesn't call back through our website they can request an appointment or schedule an appointment or click a call.

And if they don't call back that patient immediately they lose that patient.

So we've actually worked with our providers leading into this round of DTC to tighten up that feedback loop.

So those are the things that we're doing differently.

I would call this a beta-plus program, and we're still experimenting.

We are -- we do know that we are breaking all of our records already right now in web sessions, physician-locator searches, and booking appointments at this stage of the campaign versus last year.

And the challenge there is then being able to track those patients, getting to the practice, and then once they get to the practice, turning them into treatment sessions.

So we're tightening that feedback loop on this next round.

And we'll be able to understand going forward a little better what that return on investment is.

But I think, we've qualified and quantified this before, this is not millions of dollars of spends, we're learning as it relates to what the return on investment is here.

But clearly, it did help us, I mean, the types of numbers that we're seeing here in the third quarter and in the back half of the second quarter are up, and this is just one reason why.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  If you guys go to the next stage it sounds like you did get utilization growth right up.

And then just kind of last question on Japan.

I think you guys have a number of NeuroStar systems already in Japan.

And I think you referenced 150 physicians that are showing up to some of the training sessions.

So are those folks that already have a system?

And then once you do get reimbursement, should we assume a pretty quick ramp given the installed-base that is already out there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Oh, yes, thanks.

So really there are no active commercial units in Japan currently.

And the only thing that's in our revenue line right now is an amortized milestone payment for the upfront milestone that we got from Teijin, when we signed the contract.

So what you're seeing -- so what's going on is the JSPN called -- has an annual meeting, 2 meetings a year where they train on the basic science of TMS.

And in June, they held their meeting and in 72 hours of notice of the meeting, the meeting was full.

And they announced a couple weeks ago that they're doing a course again in January, and within 2 days the meeting was full.

So these are people that don't have systems, that are really interested in learning more about the science.

And then what happens is our partner, Teijin, then takes about 20 of those providers every month and brings them to their facility and goes through the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System in detail with them, so they're familiar with the technology.

And then what they are also working on right now is capital equipment budgets in 2019.

So they're setting the stage with these providers roughly somewhere between 200 and 300 before capital equipment budgets are due, they'll have talked to and discussed the opportunity to put a NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System into their facility.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  And our next question comes from Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jason Richard Mills,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD of Research &amp; Analyst   [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Congratulations on a good quarter.

I was going to start somewhere else Chris, but the Japan discussion, I wanted to pull on that thread little bit more, it sounds interesting.

So can you frame the Japanese opportunity for us again, relative to the U.S. opportunity?

Just as you look at the geographical makeup of Japan, the patient makeup of Japan relative to the U.S., just as using the U.S. as a guide?

And just sort of give us some sort of a qualitative assessment of how Japan may play out next year?

Because I don't think many of us have much in the way of revenue and the stock probably doesn't trade on Japan next year, but if you're doing well in the U.S., and you get a kicker in Japan, it certainly will make a difference.

So maybe you level set us with Japan and how that rolls out in the first year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Sure, Jason.

Yes, thanks for the question.

Right.

So when we think about the market opportunity, we think about the market opportunity in the serviceable addressable market to be about 1/3 of what it is in the U.S.

The serviceable addressable market in the U.S. is about $3 billion.

The serviceable addressable market in Japan is about $1 billion.

The difference in Japan is, they actually have a much higher concentration of psychiatric-only hospitals, local community-based hospitals.

And a lot of their moderate to severe MDD patients are actually admitted to inpatient facilities.

And they're not treated on an outpatient basis.

So it's a little bit slightly different model.

That's why we picked our partner Teijin Pharma, because they have really good relationships within the inpatient hospitals throughout Japan, and these psychiatric hospitals throughout Japan.

So that's why we picked that partner.

We have not -- giving any guidance as it relates to revenues for Japan.

We will provide that in the -- during our first quarter call next year.

By that time, we'll better understand not just if we got reimbursement, what that reimbursement rate is, because that will certainly have some impact on the first year and the following year revenues.

The other thing -- the only other thing I'd say is that the awareness in Japan is on TMS is actually much higher than where the company started when the company got their approval in 2009.

And there is quite a bit good understanding of our success here in the States.

And so I view that adoption curve to potentially be better sooner, faster, steeper in Japan early versus the adoption current that we had when we first rolled out the product here.

And remember, the other thing is, is that we'll have national reimbursement.

So everyone will be covered come March 1, if everything goes through this year.

Everyone will be covered March 1.

So we don't have to worry about converting the max in 95 other private payors.

We won't have that barrier of entry in our way.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jason Richard Mills,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD of Research &amp; Analyst   [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Got it.

That's helpful.

And just a follow-up on this and then one for the U.S. Maybe give us a sense for the competitive landscape in Japan as you see it over the next couple of years?

You're doing fine here and there's a few smaller competitors that we get questions on, but clearly, in the United States here, you're doing just fine.

In Japan, what's that look like?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

So Japan -- we know that one of our competitors applied several years ago for approval.

And our understanding was that they didn't accept their clinical data.

But that was many years ago.

We understand that at least one of our competitors has applied for approval.

And it remains to be seen what MHLW will require, as it relates to the clinical data.

That said, we feel like we've got a head start for sure, I mean, we're going to be the only approved product in Japan to start.

And then, others will have to get their product approved during MHLW process.

So the competitive landscape will be a little bit less competitive than in this year in the U.S.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jason Richard Mills,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD of Research &amp; Analyst   [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay.

And then just lastly for me in the United States, Chris, can you give us a sense for -- you placed more NeuroStar Systems than we were modeling this quarter, which is good.

And I'm just curious the makeup of those new system placements, specifically, into which they are going?

Maybe talk a little bit about the number of brand-new customers that you brought on board this quarter?

How that's trending?

Folks that are adding a second or a third system?

And what that might mean to utilization?

Just any context you can give with respect to the complexion of customers in the quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Sure, Jason.

So we've seen over the last couple quarters more multisystem initial purchases from first-time customers.

And most of our purchases in any given quarter are from first-time customers.

And so -- and then, we are seeing the number of systems per location increase slightly from where we were at the beginning of the year.

So we are seeing some follow-on in our existing customer base, and we are seeing more multisystem purchases upfront.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  And I'm showing no further question at this time.

I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Chris Thatcher for any further remarks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Thanks again, for joining us today.

And we look forward to updating you on our progress on our next call.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Ladies and gentleman, thank you for participating in today's conference.

This concludes today's program.

You may all disconnect.

Everyone, have a great day.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  First off, just wanted to follow up on the inputs to guidance, kind of what gets you to the low end, the high end?

It seems like you are going to add more sales reps, more BDMs than originally thought, and the guidance appears relatively in line.

So are you assuming maybe the sales rep productivity goes down?

Or just walk us through those.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP of Finance &amp; CFO   [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

I assume, Margaret, before we answer your -- this is Peter.

Good morning.

I assume you're referring to the full-year 2019 guidance?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Correct.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP of Finance &amp; CFO   [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Sure.

I mean, just to remind you, we set our guidance based off of the model, right?

And it's worked well for us.

You've been following us for a while.

The number of BDMs are the key driver to that model, and we put them in there at flat productivity.

I was always hoping for better, but we put them in there at flat productivity.

We use their -- we use historical utilization rates for the utilization based on the prior year [capacity], which is the largest [one] as well as the new installs for 2019.

We assume a little bit of a decline in ASP on the treatment sessions at 3% to 5%, and as Chris indicated in his prepared remarks, there's no revenue up for Japan, right?

So that's how we set up the guidance for the full year.

And you're right, we do have a few additional BDMs in the plan with the total of 15 expected up for 2019.

Those are staged through the year, and we put them into the model and it generated the guidance which we guided you to today.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay.

So if we kind of look at that BDMs and the fact that they outperformed for 2018 on the number of system sales, is that the historical reps versus the new reps that are coming online?

And then can you speak anything to the quality of reps you're bringing on and the advertising dollars you're spending, any kind of clarity on the ROI there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP of Finance &amp; CFO   [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

I'll take the first part, and maybe we can tag team with Chris, parts two and three.

So what we have in there for the BDMs, Margaret, are they did.

You're right.

They slightly overperformed our expectations.

And if you remember, a BDM is considered a full BDM in month 13.

So there's some blending there.

But if you take the blended average of the seasoned reps versus the new reps, and I think we're a little skewed right now towards the unseasoned rep, which would lower the blended rate.

But what we did is we did not take into some of that overachievement in 2019 -- into our 2019 guidance.

We view as kind of where we have always been, just assuming for conservative -- just take that's their productivity for the BDMs.

I hope that answers the first part of your question.

And then obviously, we take ASP is a big driver.

If you recall, we guided to at least a few kind of low-single digits price deterioration on the capital piece, and we are pleasantly surprised.

We came up at less than 1% decline.

So we did build in some decline in ASP into our guidance for 2019, again, in the low-single digits, knowing that we achieved less than 1% price decline and have been 7 or 8 quarters straight of kind of record ASPs on the NeuroStars.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay, yes.

And that's helpful.

Then just to follow up on the advertising ROI.

If you can give us a sense of what that was in 2018, expectations for spend into 2019, knowing that you guys are trialing the steps, but it seems like you referenced maybe an ability to improve the psychiatrist customer conversion rate?

So ways that you could potentially do that as well would be helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

Sure.

So good morning, Margaret.

So this is really a beta that we're running, and I qualify it as a test and retest, and we're still in the learning process here.

And we haven't and we don't plan to share the level of detail as it relates to the expense, but it's incorporated in our OpEx guidance as well.

But I can give you a little bit better sense.

So the first metric we look at is just the basic increase in traffic, and it is -- they either increase significantly or the cost -- the number -- the cost is then reduced each time we've done this to get patients to come to our website.

And more importantly, we look at the leads generation, which is the physician locator searches, appointments booked online and click to call.

And from our side of the funnel, and this is our side of funnel, which we feel we are optimizing each time we've done this, but we still have some work to do in converting these leads into treated patients once they go to practice, and what we've learned this most recent time around, is we found that practices that follow up quickly on patients, and remember, these patients are depressed, have a much higher conversion rate, and we're exploring opportunities to capitalize on this finding.

And we'll keep you abreast of how that evolves.

But we'll start talking about ROIs when we start, what I would say, investing significantly on this.

And at this point, I would qualify what we're doing as a beta.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP of Finance &amp; CFO   [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  And then there was one other -- to you, Chris, the second part of Margaret's original question was just on the quality of the reps. And Chris can certainly take it.

From where I sit, Margaret, as we put it into the model, as we shared with you before, we're at or ahead of our hiring schedule.

We were all of 2018, we are attracting kind of President's Club Winners from a lot of the larger medical device companies, where it's a lot easier to recruit when you're growing 31% have a unique technology out there.

So we found that the quality of the rep and our ability to attract that talent has exceeded our expectations.

So we're confident that we could fill the 15 reps, again, in 2019 at or ahead of schedule because we've done it for the last 2 years.

I don't know, Chris, if you have any more to add.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  And our next question comes from Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Louis Turkaly,  JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  I know you mentioned some of the meetings that you guys were at in February and it looks like the first one in Vancouver that there was a discussion of the contact sensing.

And I think that's sort of one of the bigger differentiators of your technology.

You mentioned a head-to-head study.

So I was just curious if you'd talk to us about how big a differentiator that is?

And what were the outcomes of that study?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

Good morning, Dave.

I think what you're referring to is we did an even factors testing that showed that [it's in four styles that were] reproducible by a NeuroStar user than it is for one of the competitors to be more reproducible in placing their magnet.

And at a high level -- and we haven't published this yet.

We will publish it shortly.

But at a high level, it shows that the NeuroStar is much more predictable and reproducible in finding the treatment location and having the magnet aligned, and it is relatively significant.

The findings generally were in the high teens, around 15% of the NeuroStar users were more precise in finding the treatment location than one of our competitors.

And then in the study, we actually crossed over treaters as well and the competitors were actually much more efficient in finding the treatment location time and time again in using our system.

And we have several -- and you might recall, our product was actually designed for psychiatry and high throughput device, where these products are actually neurological products that were not designed for this.

And I think that came out in this human factor study.

And it did bring out kind of the benefits of NeuroStar and the way it's designed versus how the competitors' product is.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Louis Turkaly,  JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  And two quick ones on the account base.

So I think you mentioned that upgrades were a little lower in '18, but I imagine it's because most people have already decided to do so.

So I guess what percent of your installed base do you think is upgraded to the faster regimen?

And as a last one, you mentioned some of the ASP declined because of the high-volume accounts.

So obviously, not a bad thing if you're getting a lot of volume from discounting a bit because the accounts are using it so often.

I guess, any color on what percent of the installed base you kind of think is moving towards that high-volume area?

Or is there today?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP of Finance &amp; CFO   [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

So we think it's about half taking advantage of the upgrade, Dave.

And keep in mind, too, that beginning in the second quarter of 2017, all the systems have the 19-minute treatment session.

So each successive quarter as you get past that -- April of 2017, there'll be less upgrade revenue, right, because there are less folks taking advantage of it.

So we've found that it's really good for customers that are trying to manage peak load.

As you can imagine, a lot of folks would like to come in before work or start their day doing treatment or come in over lunch or end their day a little early.

So there's that -- it helps alleviate that.

So those customers that are generally trying to manage that and it's more cost-effective than buying a second system.

So those are the folks that take advantage of the treatment session upgrade technology, right?

And then you mentioned -- you were talking a little bit about treatment.

I want to make sure I answer all your questions.

Treatment session pricing, we've been pretty consistent, Chris and I have over the course of last few quarters, of telling folks, we expect kind of mid-single digits kind of 3% to 4%, 5% range of price breaks that we give customers and reminding folks out there that this is not a discount we do to drive sales at the end of the quarter or just for promotions on these treatment sessions.

These are predetermined, we negotiate with the customer, and it's all part of this surrounding the customer and partnering with them, right?

So we share in their success.

As the volumes goes up, we give them price breaks.

And as we've said, 3% to 5% -- and that's what volumes, Dave, growing in kind of the 23%, 24%, 25% range.

When you see volumes kind of growing faster or system sales growing faster, then you could see getting above the 5% range.

But we're comfortable guiding that, that's where we'll be 3% to 5% kind of price breaks will take hold again in 2019 versus 2018, and we'll come back and tell you the good news, right?

It's really good news because we'll trade 1 point or a few basis points of ASP on a product that's growing 95% -- has 95 -- 90% to 95% margins for us that's growing and people are taking advantage of the technology.

  And our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Just to start off with guidance to put a little bit of finer point on it.

You've grown north of 25%-ish for the last 6 quarters.

You're now guiding 18% to 22%.

It implies a pretty meaningful deceleration in the back half of the year even though in Q1, here after toughest comp, you're still guiding very good top line growth.

So I'm just wondering if there's something specifically that you're trying to call out in the back half that we need to pay attention to?

Or if it's just a bit of management conservatism?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP of Finance &amp; CFO   [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

So good morning, Matt.

Thanks for the question.

And I'll parrot kind of first what I told Margaret.

We're basing full year guidance at 18% to 22%, right?

And that's all the reasons I cited to Margaret a few minutes ago.

We're using all kind of historical utilization rates, historical averages, productivity.

We build in some price declines as I've answered in a couple of previous questions and that spits out a number, Matt, for full year guidance in that 20% range, right?

So that's where we, as a management team, want to be comfortable giving that number.

For the first quarter, right, given that we're 2 months into the quarter already, we have more visibility, right?

So we have a lot more confidence in projecting a higher growth rate for the first quarter relative to the annual guidance.

But the annual guidance is set based on all those predicates that I pointed out on the call, which is the addition of the BDMs, their flat productivity year-over-year, some modest price declines on the capital and 3% to 5% price breaks on the treatment sessions, with no increase in utilization.

Obviously, we intend to a bit overachieve on those, and we'll come back to you as we go out through the year.

And if we can point to something, a trend, then we'll adjust our guidance accordingly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay.

So you've built in quite a few leverage points then potentially, maybe if those would come through like they did in '18, there could be upside?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Let me put this together, Matt.

We think about a lot of things.

And so we think about the productivity of the business development managers.

As we add more, could the productivity potentially decline?

Could it stay the same?

Could it slightly increase like it did this year?

And we put that range in there, we make an assumption range on pricing, and we're making an assumption range on utilization.

We consider the marketplace that we're in as well, and we put that all together and we try to be really thoughtful with it and give you a range where we feel comfortable that we're going to achieve within that range.

So this is where we've come out.

We've, I think, given a pretty good range for the first quarter.

Our growth rate is strong coming off of Q4, and you can project from there, and we'll keep you updated quarter-to-quarter as we implement.

In Q1, we'll give you an update on how we feel the rest of the year is going to go.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay.

Fair enough.

Can we talk a little bit about the -- you've added so many systems in the last -- especially in the back half of last year, but over the last couple of years.

It's difficult to tease out the growth rates on the treatment side for some of your more tenured facilities.

So when you look at the growth rate in treatment session revenue, I think it was up 23%.

Can you talk a little bit about some of the more mature centers and how they're trending as far as their growth rates go?

I mean, are they growing well ahead of what you expected?

Or any just kind of qualitative commentary there would be helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP of Finance &amp; CFO   [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

I'll start, Matt, and I'll let Chris weigh in if he needs to.

If you look at the historical base, it's roughly two patients a day, right?

And obviously, the new HVT strategy, once they get up and running, have 3x more potential right, round numbers.

As that we just talked about, we're not factoring in that potential into our guidance, but certainly, the newer accounts are achieving ahead at a much higher level or will be at a much higher level over time, and we're starting to see some of the fruits of that strategy which is -- we're still, believe it or not, still kind of in the early innings with respect to that strategy.

So we're comfortable that those accounts have a much higher potential, but we're -- we haven't given you the granularity around that just yet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay.

Fair enough.

And the last one for me.

Just on the OpEx side, I mean the guide for the year was a little bit -- was more than we were modeling.

And I think I get it.

I think it's more on the personnel side with the BDMs, and CTCs, CPCs, et cetera.

So how do we think about those investments?

Is it fair to say '19 is a personnel kind of driven year above what we may have expected?

And then into '20, could be more on the clinical side and then with the new indications you're going after plus next-generation technology?

And I don't know if you want to talk about it or not, but do you want to give us any sense for when that next-generation product would be out?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP of Finance &amp; CFO   [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes, I'll handle the quantitative stuff, and I'll let Chris come in.

So I think what you said, Matt, for the most part, is pretty accurate.

If you think about 2019, the largest driver versus 2018 will be the increase in personnel, right?

It's the 15 BDMs.

And I know of folks who were thinking it might be as low as 10 or as high as 15, and we're on the high end of that range.

So that's the lion's share of the OpEx increase.

And then as you think about the R&amp;D line, it's two components, which is the product development, next-gen platform.

That's the second largest driver of the year-over-year increase and the largest driver within the R&amp;D line.

And then there's a small component, especially, as we get into the back half of 2019 on the clinical spend, which is the two indications.

You are correct that, that will ramp and start to be a little bit of a higher number as you look at to 2020 before starting to tail back down, much like most clinicals would do.

And then there's a small increase, just as you think about 2018 versus 2019, Matt, in terms of the G&amp;A costs, which is the full year of public company costs.

But those are 1 through 4, the drivers of the year-over-year increase and perhaps differences in how you were initially viewing our 2019.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  And our next question comes from Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Cecilia E. Furlong,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - Associate   [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This is actually Cecilia on for Jason.

And I just wanted to ask kind of further around BDMs, CTCs and what you're viewing as what your current ratio and then just what would be an optimal ratio going forward?

And then just thinking about 2019, how you're looking at or expecting the cadence of hires and to occur to -- of the BDMs and if this could provide upside to your guidance?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP of Finance &amp; CFO   [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Well, let me dissect those.

I didn't write them all down.

If I miss any, we can circle back.

So it's 15 BDMs, much like we did as our first year of a public company is we will come out, and we'll update you how many we add each quarter.

What we've generally guided folks to is to use a half year convention.

So 15 BDM adds would probably equate to 7 or 8 full-time equivalents over the course of the year, and we'll fine-tune that throughout the year.

As far as BDMs versus CPC, we don't have a ratio on that.

We basically -- we look and assess where the territories that -- where we need to add the BDMs, and we said, we've been saying consistently, we've gone from 15 to 29, 29 to 44 and, and we'll go 44 to 59.

We're going to continue to add and split territories because we have full geographic coverage now.

So we'll be looking to add in those territories that we think have potential in those accounts.

The CPCs, again, not on a ratio basis, but you can see that we've had a little bit of leverage on the CPCs if you just take the treatment session revenue line over the number of CPCs that we've shared with you over time.

At the same time, we're always -- it's not a ratio, but we're assessing the workload in those territories and the account maintenance required.

Not all accounts are created equal.

Some require a little bit more maintenance.

So that's sort of how we view the world.

We have said that the CPCs revenue per territory have historically been down, closer to $1 million, and we said, over time, that could get a little better over time.

And I think if you do the math yourself, you'll see that there's a little bit of leverage going on over the last couple of years.

But that's sort of how we assess the situation, and we work hand in glove with the commercial team on where they think they need help relative to the territories.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Cecilia E. Furlong,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - Associate   [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay, great.

And then if I could just ask on [OpEx] just specifically around clinical trials.

You mentioned kind of seeing a little bit more of an impact from PTSD and Bi-Polar in the second half.

Can you just walk us through kind of your current thinkings around timelines, what we should expect to hear from you, and then just thinking about 2020 and how that plays through?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

Sure.

Good morning, Cecilia.

So our plan here is we're meeting with the FDA later in the year on both of these trials, and that's around the trial design.

So at this point in time, I really can't comment on a timeline, and we'll keep you updated and abreast on it.

But basically, we have to get, like every other company, we'd have to get our IDE approved.

We'd have to enroll the patients.

We'd have to assess the clinical data and then submit that to the FDA.

So this is, fair to say, a several-year program for both PTSD and Bi-Polar.

And as the quarters continue to advance, we'll keep you abreast of how those conversations with the FDA are and what the specific timelines are when we know them.

But I think it's an exciting time for psychiatry and patients.

When you think about PTSD and Bi-Polar, those two diseases, which are significant -- have significant unmet needs, both of them we know in early clinical findings have responded to NeuroStar TMS Therapy in small pilots.

And we're excited about the potential of helping a group of really sick patients that don't have an alternative today.

So -- and it's on our call point as well.

So that's why we're kicking this off this year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  And our next question comes from Alex Silverman with Special Situations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alex Silverman,    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  I'm wondering -- a couple of quick questions.

Wondering if you could give us any sense of that $71.5 million to $76.5 million OpEx, how much of that is noncash?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP of Finance &amp; CFO   [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

The majority -- Alex, this is Peter.

Just kind of making sure I fully think it through.

Most of it is our cash expenses.

It's personnel related to the R&amp;D efforts, the consulting efforts that go around next-gen platform, the clinical trial piece and then obviously, the sales force expansion would be all salary benefits and then the fully loaded.

So I would say all if not most of it, though there's a small equity comp component in there that would lower the number, but the lion's share is cash.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alex Silverman,    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay.

Secondly, given that you haven't been public that long, wondering if you could give us a sense of seasonality in terms of first quarter mix?

How we should think about it?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

So -- and this is evolving a little bit as well as we get larger and larger.

And there's seasonality effects for sure, typically in November and December, what we see is less patients getting started in November and December because we're starting a 6-week therapy, and a lot of doctors delay, which usually leads to a slightly lower NeuroStar treatment session in the first quarter.

And then usually, treatment sessions from there take off for a couple of reasons is because we have much more systems that are installed in later part of Q3 and in early parts of Q4.

And I would say, in Q1 -- Q1 is a little bit compounded with NeuroStar treatment session starts because what happens is, in Q4, you can see we had a record-breaking Q4.

Our system sales were up 46%, north of $4 million.

It was quite the quarter.

And what happens is when we get that many systems in a short period of time and many of those systems were actually backloaded into November and December, getting them up, it's somewhat -- it's a high-class problem.

It overwhelms the CPCs in the short term.

So in Q1, we're digging out, getting customers up and running and trained.

So for those reasons, we see a little bit of softness on the NeuroStar treatment sessions.

But we typically, though, see a nice bump in NeuroStar's place year-over-year because we now have 15 more BDMs in the territory in the beginning of this quarter versus last year.

So typically, we see a really nice lift in NeuroStar sales in the first quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alex Silverman,    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay.

And that's helpful.

And last question is, what's your typical length of NeuroStar sales cycle?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

So that's -- we do, and we have implemented as of the beginning of last year a CRM module.

Last year, we actually are now calling on a different subsegment of psychiatrists.

And the -- our expectation is the deals typically close in less than 6 months.

That's at a maximum length of time, and we've had deals close as quickly as 3 weeks.

And a lot is deal-specific.

So somewhere between 3 weeks and 6 months is the typical cycle.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  That concludes our question-and-answer session for today.

I would now like to turn the call back over to Chris Thatcher for any closing remarks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  So thank you for joining us this morning.

We look forward to keeping you abreast with the progress we make in 2019 in upcoming earnings calls.

Have a good day.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

This does conclude today's program, and you may all disconnect.

Everyone, have a wonderful day.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity.

Your next question comes from the line of David Turkaly with JMP Securities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Louis Turkaly,  JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Hey, I was wondering, just as a -- I had a quick one for you about the upcoming APA meeting.

I was wondering if there was anything there that you're expecting to see.

Any sort of data releases or anything else like that that we can look forward to out in San Fran in a couple of weeks?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

So we view this as our largest sales call of the year.

We have tens of customers that were planning to meet and greet at the booth and introduce our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system to.

There's a great opportunity for us to crease increased awareness around the difference in our product as well as convert our leads into sales.

So we view this as our biggest sales call.

There's -- we will have at the booth, we will have a series of psychiatrists talking about their experience with NeuroStar throughout the conference.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Louis Turkaly,  JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Got it.

And I apologize, I was hopping back and forth between a few today, but I noticed in your remarks you talked about higher capital and then also rent to own revenue.

I was wondering is there any color in terms of the split where that stands today.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

Yes.

Thanks, David.

This is where we thought we'd be in total NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue.

It is a little bit higher in rental and a little bit lower in capital but our ultimate goal is to expand our install base and we're able to do that in the first quarter and the mix is just slightly higher and slightly different than we had anticipated.

There's no underlying trend in the business, we just had a slightly different mix than we expected.

Do you want to talk a little bit about the accounting, Peter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CFO, VP &amp; Corporate Secretary   [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes, sure.

In addition, Dave, this quarter, some of the leases were accounted for that's sales-type leases.

That's opposed to operating leases.

I'm sure you're seeing that elsewhere as well.

The impact of this is all the revenue from the lease is recognized upfront as opposed to being recognized over the term of the lease and that's an assessment, Dave, that will have to be done each quarter.

Customer by customer, lease by lease, and that could cause some volatility in the NeuroStar Therapy revenue line and at least between the categories of capital sales and rental.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Louis Turkaly,  JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Got it.

One last one.

You mentioned the active install base, 931.

Any color there?

I'm just curious how many of the centers are using more than one system.

And just remind us, the 931 is out of how many that you think you can actually get penetrate over time?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  So David, we don't have the -- that number at our fingertips here as it relates to the number of centers that have multiple systems but it's more than a hundred, for sure, that have more than one system.

And as you know, our whole goal is to increase system utilization and if you look at our system utilization we're quite proud of what we accomplished in the first quarter.

System utilization is actually up and when you think about the number of system installs in Q1 versus prior year, we're up almost right around 19% in system installs with some pricing decline in NeuroStar treatment session pricing.

When you think about those two numbers combined, those are really diluted to utilization and what you see is in our -- in this first quarter is utilization is actually up.

So we're quite enthusiastic about our ability to ramp up our current systems with -- in the face of that dilution.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Your next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The first one for me is maybe just a little bit more color on the one customer that you guys spoke about in the morning comments that maybe pulled (inaudible) from the field.

Can you give us any more clarity around whether that's competitive, operational or something else?

And then did that also impact [competitive] sales for this quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

Thanks for the question.

So yes, this was primarily driven by one large customer and the business venture did not work out for them and the systems were pulled out of the active install base.

They had a very aggressive plan to grow their business and they were not able to get the business capitalized.

So these systems were low-performing systems so we don't expect any sort of material impact on loss revenues from NeuroStar treatment session going forward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CFO, VP &amp; Corporate Secretary   [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  It wasn't -- to finish the question, Margaret, not competitive and no impact on the quarter.

Keep in mind that you know, we use a rolling year so a lot of these fell out a while back, so it's incorporated into our guidance now it backed on the quarter, not the result of a competitive situation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay.

Perfect.

And then in terms of the year-over-year utilization growth that you guys referred to on the call, can you give us a number around that and then whether or not the -- that utilization growth, how should we think about that throughout the year especially as you guys have started investing, it sounds like, in the national DTC advertising campaign?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes, so the utilization is mid to low single digits in the face of a 20% dilution and when we talk about dilution in this case it's a positive event, as you well know, when we're adding 18% new systems.

Those systems are typically dilutive to the utilization number coupled with a several point decline in pricing.

So we're quite pleased with 20% dilution that our system utilization is actually up low to mid-single digits.

So, that's a good thing.

You know, we're not going to forecast the next couple of quarters on utilization but we've been able to maintain this trend now for several quarters and we're quite excited about our ability to ramp our existing customers and the fact that that number is even positive is, I think, a wonderful thing based on all of the systems that we sold in the last couple of quarters.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Got it.

Great.

And then maybe the last one for me.

You referenced a little bit more mix on the rental side, I think on the last question.

But in terms of other clarity on the system sales that you saw this quarter, are you continuing to see strong repeat purchases from those existing accounts, you know, those high volume focus accounts?

And again, how should we think about this relative to your expectations both this quarter and throughout the rest of the year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

So we are seeing a slight increase over the last 4 quarters in second, third, fourth and 14th system purchased within our install base and we're seeing a slight increase.

We're not reporting out on how we're breaking it out but most of our systems are first-time purchases in Q1.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Your next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jason Richard Mills,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD of Research &amp; Analyst   [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Chris, can you hear me this time?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jason Richard Mills,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD of Research &amp; Analyst   [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Good -- I [forgot] the mute button, sorry.

So just start a couple of good questions already from my colleagues.

So let's start in Japan.

You -- you've commented about the reimbursement level.

I just would like a bit more color on your strategy there.

Let's say 2020 through 2022.

I understand you're probably not willing to give us quantitative metrics but wanted your strategy nonetheless just as it relates to attempting to renegotiate reimbursement rates higher, what you think that will take and ultimately within those 160 centers you're allowed to start in, what can be the -- the treatment system utilization.

What can be the market opportunity, I guess, from an [TAM] perspective within that cohort of centers?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

So let's talk about our market segmentation strategy.

No matter how many sites we were approved to go in to sell to, we were going to go into the highest -- the most respected psychiatric institutes in Japan and these are well-known institutes.

All of these are on the list and we were planning on going into the places that have the highest in-patient and out-patient volume.

So the 160 facilities are aligned with what I would call, you know, our inner bulls eye core, first mover commercial strategy and it will take us a couple of years to penetrate these facilities.

We expect these facilities to be able to handle multiple NeuroStar's and they currently have tens of thousands of patients in-patient in these facilities.

We haven't -- because of the new news around these 160 facilities, at this stage we don't have the total number of in-patient and out-patient but you should consider these opportunities as some of the largest psychiatric opportunities for us in the U.S. and in Japan and should model those accordingly.

Now remember, we're just starting here in June and Japan is already -- Teijin has already bought a handful of more systems so they have an inventory in place and they're going to start selling aggressively come June 1.

It's uncertain if they're going to order again in the back half of this year and as you know, it takes a little bit of time to get these things up and running so we won't see much NeuroStar treatment sessions probably into 2020 and beyond.

So let me stop there, Jason.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jason Richard Mills,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD of Research &amp; Analyst   [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay.

No.

That's helpful.

Second question.

Just circling back to the install base.

That having been said, the average install base for active units was a little lower than what we were modeling.

So we just wanted to maybe have a new conversation here about what you see as the market opportunity.

In our model, we're expecting you to exit the year sort of in and around a couple of hundred install, active install, higher than you are currently.

So that would imply good growth of say somewhere in the range of 50 to 60 average ads per quarter.

Is that the right way to think about the progress of your business through this year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

Jason, so our guidance to the market has always been take a look at the number of business development managers we have selling systems.

Those have been pretty consistent for this quarter as well as for last year.

And as we add more business development, as we sell more systems, and that's really how the capital equipment revenue was built, that in conjunction with rental revenue gives you all NeuroStar revenue and we're excited where we came in for the quarter at 41% growth.

That's impressive NeuroStar revenue growth for us, right at where we expected.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jason Richard Mills,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD of Research &amp; Analyst   [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay, helpful.

And then lastly, Peter, maybe bringing you into the conversation about the ASP's going forward, first on the (inaudible) sessions, the 3% decline was at the lower end of the 3% to 5% expectation and had been trending, I think, a little higher than that the pasts couple of quarters.

What are the implications as we think about that juxtaposed to the HVT, the high value target initiative?

And is the deceleration in decline due to coming up against tougher comps there?

Or are you, indeed, seeing a stabilization around this level going forward do you think?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CFO, VP &amp; Corporate Secretary   [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  That's a good question, Jason.

This is Peter.

Yes.

The 3% to 5% remains intact, and I think we've been pretty consistent that when the growth rate tends to be in the low 20's, which it was this quarter, 21%, and keep in mind Q1 is historically a low utilization month due to starts, right, people aren't starting after Thanksgiving so you see a slowdown in Q4 and then it's the big (inaudible) assistants that are just getting up to speed.

So the 21% is in line with expectations and with that, Jason, that puts us towards the lower end of the range which is 3% and, as we've said before, when that numbers ticks up into the mid 20's or closer to 30%, then you could see -- pricing breaks that would take you above or at -- at or above the 5% range.

And we've seen that in the past, so I would characterize this quarter consistent with what we were expecting and obviously right on the low end of the range.

  Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Hopefully, you can hear me okay.

Just wanted to follow up on the one larger customer that returned their systems to you.

Is this something that you've seen historically with some customers doing something along this line?

Maybe more of a single customer or two doing something like that?

Just given that this was multiple systems.

I'm sure that's going to draw a lot of attention among investors and they want to make sure there's nothing that's really systematically wrong with the ability to build models for a lot of these centers going forward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  So this is just one customer, all right, and we've done this now -- we have over 500 customers out there.

This is one customer and this is a business that had a very aggressive plan to grow their business and they didn't get capitalized to grow their business.

So this is what I would say is an isolated issue.

You can see what our inactive turnover rate has been historically, and historically, it's been very low.

And this is just a one-off and -- but we wanted to call it out because it was a group within one customer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Got it.

And then another thing that comes up quite a bit is the competitive environment and with 41% system growth in the quarter, clearly you're not seeing much of an impact at this point.

I would just love if you could comment a little bit more about the landscape that you're seeing out there as far as accounts go and time that it takes to attract and close accounts.

Is that growing, is it taking longer just given some more of the maybe the competitive commentary coming out.

Anything along those lines that you're seeing, you know, head-to-head wins, any other commentary that you can provide there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

Sure, thanks.

Thanks, Matt.

So as we all know, this is a very large market opportunity.

Overall, the category is well underpenetrated and we've been competing against the current market entrees anywhere from 5 to 3 years.

And nothing has really changed.

You know, we have a sales and marketing organization that we estimate to be four to five times the total size of all the competitors combined and we're executing as planned.

We think this is a really terrific first quarter, 25% top-line growth.

This is the highest revenue growth of the -- in the companies history for Q1 and 41% NeuroStar system growth.

So, we feel like we're executing as planned against the competitors out there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  That's fair.

The last one for me, and there's 2 parts to it but -- so I'll just ask them both here.

Maybe for Peter, I think you have the tough -- you just came out of the toughest comp of the year.

You've put a very good performance in Q1.

Didn't change guidance at all, and so I just want to make sure that's not signaling anything that you're worried about something in the last 3 quarters of the year.

Maybe you could say something along the lines of feel more comfortable with the mid-point of the range or even a little bit higher end of the range.

And then the other question would be, you know, given your commentary about the new system that you're investing in right now and some thoughts among investors that it's really just a pricing game kind of environment, you know, what can you add to the feature set equation that makes this bigger investment that you're making in next generation system worth it to really continue to differentiate yourself and win in this market?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Peter, why don't you take the first one?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CFO, VP &amp; Corporate Secretary   [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

I was going to take the first part, and then I'll pass to Chris for the second part.

So to answer your question, no Matt, we feel really comfortable where we're at.

We're right in line.

We've got -- we give a range.

We're in the midpoint of the range which is implicitly we feel really good about the [62.5 to 64.5] for the full year, and we're just executing to that plan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  And then as it relates to the new system, we think that as good as our system is today, it could be better.

And we're focused on feature sets to make this more efficient, more precise and more reproducible and we are looking forward to delighting customers in the future when they see this next generation system.

And this system will also be compatible and able to deliver our new indications as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  That concludes our question and answer for today.

I will now turn the call back to Chris Thatcher for closing remarks.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jason Richard Mills,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD of Research &amp; Analyst   [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  I look forward to seeing you over the next couple of days at our conference.

So Chris first, congratulations on a great quarter.

I wanted to ask you about the juxtaposition of your upside growth in treatment session revenue which -- or treatment session procedures, which has been quite strong frankly for several quarters now.

And then that juxtaposed to the treatment session ASPs.

So I know that your policy has been to offer volume discounts and seemingly happy to do it given treatment session revenue procedures are growing so fast.

But how should we think about this juxtaposition, let's say, over the next couple of years?

Are we going to continue to see this level of volume discount pricing?

Or will that moderate a little bit?

I just can't help but think that with this level of growth in procedures, if ASPs were more in line with your long-term view of sort of 3%, 4%, that the numbers could be even bigger.

And I just wanted your thoughts on that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Right.

So thanks, Jason, looking forward to seeing you on Thursday at Canaccord conference.

As it relates to our general guidance, we've generally guided mid-single-digit declines in ASP for NeuroStar treatment session and that will -- the decline in ASP will increase if our volume expectations are higher than we assumed in our guidance because along with higher volumes, providers get greater decreases.

And if our treatment session approach should slow, then our price decline would be less in a given quarter.

And that's played out consistently for the last 4, 5 quarters.

So we've had another nice unit volume uptick again this quarter.

And in return, the pricing decline for NeuroStar treatment sessions is slightly higher than our guidance.

And that's going to remain fairly consistent.

Over time, right, over time, over a year or 2, as that installed base gets larger, those price declines could be tempered longer term because they are weighted out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jason Richard Mills,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD of Research &amp; Analyst   [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  So to follow up on that, I mean obviously, you're not going to give the treatment sessions away.

So there's going to be a diminishing returns to the ASP declines, if you will, I would assume even for the higher volume guys, right?

I mean are you going to continue to offer the same level of price breaks for, let's say, the same person they got, let's say, a 10% reduction in price this year if they grow treatment session revenue in their own practice 20% to 30%?

Again next year, will they also see the same level of price cuts?

Does that make sense?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

So just to be clear, so our pricing program and plan is based on volume, we don't have many one-off agreements on pricing.

So -- and we don't renegotiate pricing every year.

So when they hit a maximum volume, the price does not continue to decline year after year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jason Richard Mills,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD of Research &amp; Analyst   [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay.

Great.

I'll move on.

Just one quick other category.

I mean I was interested to see your updated operating expense guidance.

The spending on PTSD and bipolar.

You mentioned a little bit in your prepared remarks, but I would be interested and I think investors are interested in this sort of indication expansion opportunity.

And maybe a bit more color on what your timing expectations are?

What nuances you expect with respect to a clinical study?

And just in general, maybe a bit more color on the target addressable market opportunity you see ahead in these markets as opposed to a market in OCD that one of your competitors is approaching?

Congrats on a good quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes, thanks.

So the first thing is, this is a large unmet need, both PTSD and bipolar.

Directionally, these markets in total are just slightly smaller than the MDD market.

This represents not only a big unmet need, but it also allows us to leverage our installed base.

Psychiatrists treat PTSD and bipolar as well as MDD and they're prevalent within their practices.

So this is a terrific same-store growth opportunity for us.

That said, we're planning a study that's going to be a large study.

These are going to be RCT studies, and these will be designed to address several things.

One, the FDA's need.

Second is they'll also be designed for -- to separate clinically in a way that's compelling for providers to use the technology.

And then lastly, it will be designed to be compelling for financial payers to pay for it.

So these are -- when we take a product to market, I've said this before, the difference between a product and a business is you have to get reimbursement.

And without reimbursement, it's just a product, patients can't afford it, doctors can't afford to deliver it.

So when we do a clinical trial, we think about the whole continuum as I outlined there.

These are much bigger markets than OCD and you need typically larger studies that were provided -- that were provided for OCD to get reimbursement in play.

So that's our thoughts on the category.

We're really excited about this opportunity, and we're just kicking off the process now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Your next question is from the line of Matthew O'Brien from Piper Jaffray.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Welcome, Steve, to your new role.

I wanted to start with the fixed pricing commentary on the modeling side.

I would just love to hear a little bit more about what you're doing there and then kind of how that flows through the P&amp;L?

And how we should think about that influencing numbers over the next several quarters?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes, Matt.

Yes, sure.

So we wanted to comment on this because I know that we've had some questions on the U.S.

Treatment Session revenue number.

So just to break this down is, we've also provided commentary on the increase and the decrease in volume and price relative to prior year.

I know everyone's tracking that in your models.

And if you've been tracking our historical volumes and price and you utilize our reported growth rate that we share each quarter, you're going to calculate a number that is typically lower than we report in U.S.

Treatment Session revenue.

And that difference is what we call other treatment session revenue, which is comprised of revenue from fixed-price contracts and other ancillary components.

And we want to provide you that color here today in the call.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay, Chris, but I think you said that the interest level in that fixed pricing model is lifting.

Can you just talk a little bit more about, again, why that is?

And so I think a lot of people on the call are really trying to understand the whole competitive dynamic and make sure that with that commentary plus the pricing declines that this isn't a result of you having to be more aggressive in the marketplace to get more customers and more treatment session volume.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

So just to be clear, the fixed pricing model is not reflected in any ASP decline.

Fixed pricing model just goes to total treatment session revenue.

So they're not -- they're not interacting at all.

So this is a function of what I would call a positive signal to our successful HVT penetration.

This is for the best HVT targets.

And we're learning how to best really partner with this customer to create a successful NeuroStar program with them.

And at this point, I think -- I hope you understand, we're not going to get into all the specifics for competitive reasons on a public call, but this is definitely an emerging sales strategy for us, and we wanted to highlight it here, and I think it validates our HVT strategy overall that these larger accounts are very interested in buying multiple systems at multiple locations and working with us over a longer period of time in a contracted fashion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Got it.

Okay, that makes sense.

And then the other question I had was just on the international performance.

So the guidance lift for the year is really just a function of a little better visibility with what you're doing with Tiejin.

And first of all, is that true?

And then secondly, can you just talk a little bit more about kind of the cadence of sales into Tiejin with there a big bulk of systems placed and sold here in Q2, and you won't see that in Q3, Q4?

Just any kind of color there would be helpful?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

Thanks, Matt.

So we're excited about Japan.

I'd call it tempered enthusiasm.

We're in a fuzzy front end of a commercial launch.

Actually, Tiejin has done a very good job during the precommercialization phase, and it's paying off.

Overall, they're off to a good start in this targeted segment.

As you can see in Q2, our OUS revenues are up nicely, a result of the most recent round of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy systems sales to Tiejin.

I'd also note that our increased annual guidance range does not reflect our revenue expectations for the year for Japan.

I'm sorry, it does now reflect our revenue expectations for the year for Japan.

So that's included in our annual guidance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay.

So you lifted it because of Japan specifically.

Is that the right way of viewing it?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes, the remainder of the year, what we think is going to happen.

Operator   [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Your next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  First, maybe a bigger picture strategic question.

We talked through some of the more tactical strategic decisions that you guys are doing in terms of vis-à-vis with education and some of these new pricing models.

But if we think about some of the bigger, longer-term strategic decisions that really get TMS more broadly adopted and maybe even accelerated from the point where you're at.

What measures are those?

What are you doing on those measures?

Is it price, reimbursement, data?

And do you still have room in those high-value accounts that you guys have focused on for the last year or 2?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

So thanks for the question, Margaret.

Our growth strategy is pretty straightforward.

This is a really large market as we all know.

It's underpenetrated and our ability to grow and get the patients is about hiring more people, selling more systems.

And we're at the cusp of an amazing milestone, almost 1,000 systems, but that's really just a drop in the bucket.

We're in the low single digits of penetration, the number of patients that we can treat, mid-single digits in the number of locations that have our systems.

And this is just about us commercializing in the U.S. and continue to sell systems and demonstrate that when we hire people, we sell more systems.

If we sell more systems, we treat more patients.

And that is really the strategy for the next 36 months in the U.S. And then the continued growth that will come from outside the U.S. and Japan.

And as we indicated, we're looking at other select thoughtful commercialization paths outside the U.S. And then right around that period of time, then we would come out with a new system that's really going to wow providers and set a new high bar for what people think about in a TMS system.

And then shortly on the heels of that, PTSD and bipolar and 2 new indications.

That's our growth strategy, and we're not changing.

And I know something that you have a lot interest, we have a lot of interest is, we still think that there's an opportunity in the direct-to-consumer marketing campaign.

We've made some good steps this past flight of TV and reducing our cost and increasing our lead-to-consults conversion rates by adding some new functionality and some new learnings.

So that's our strategy.

I don't think there's really a silver bullet here.

I just think that it's good commercial execution as we've outlined.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Got it.

So maybe switching over to guidance for a second.

You guys had growth of 25% this quarter.

Overall, third quarter guidance has implied kind of the 15% to 19% range.

And that implies fourth quarter growth comes in, I think, a little bit slower than third quarter growth.

So maybe walk us through the comps this year.

What this means for the U.S. as well as for international?

And I guess, more importantly, how does it set up for 2020 and beyond?

Do you guys continue to view yourself, I guess, as a 20-percent-plus top line grower going forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CFO &amp; Company Secretary   [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

So the guidance demonstrates a full year growth now between 19% and 23%, which is slightly higher than our original guidance.

Q3 has been typically a sideways and sometimes down quarter.

And this is a seasonal fluctuation that we've seen in the past.

And you can back into our Q4 number, which is in line with full year expectations.

And from there, you can start to model Q1 in 2020, and we're not going to get into guidance for 2020, but you can quickly see based on history, what that sets up Q1 to look like.

So we're guiding right now from 19% to 23%, which puts us on track to be a continued 20% grower through the end of the year.

And as we move into 2020, we'll provide guidance on 2020.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay.

Yes.

And I guess just one last one in terms of capital placements.

I'm not sure if you guys can give us any kind of breakdown from capital sales going to existing accounts versus some of the new center openings and then are you continuing to see those repeat sales with the existing accounts continuing to drive that above-average utilization?

Seems like it, but just double-checking.

And as we look at volatility on pricing within capital, should we assume very much?

Or is this kind of the new level going forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

So we've given all the metrics to determine our installed base, how big our installed base and our NeuroStar treatment sessions.

And you can see that once again, our installed base is up 20% over prior year.

And utilization rate is up again in this quarter.

So we don't report out on the systems that we're selling to existing customers versus new customers.

And we haven't broken out our NeuroStar treatment sessions by customers, but we're giving you enough metrics that you can see that even adding 20% more volume to our installed base, that our utilization rates are up, that 20% is really dilutive, right, on a per system utilization rate seeing that they just got the systems.

So we're quite excited about the utilization rates within our business, consistent growth rate now for 5 quarters, 20-plus percent NeuroStar treatment session, 30% on NeuroStar's, 25% overall, 5 quarters over 20%, taking up guidance, we're quite enthusiastic about what we're accomplishing here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [24]

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  First question for me is along the lines of guidance.

I know you guys aren't providing 2020 guidance.

But I guess what I'm hoping for is you can provide us a little bit of a sense of the moving pieces as you go into 2020.

Should we assume that growth is similar to what you're seeing in the second half of this year, better than that, and kind of walk us through the moving dynamics, whether it's leasing, utilization, et cetera?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes, Margaret, thanks for the question.

So we're -- to your point, we're not going to provide any guidance on Q4.

So we can talk a little bit more -- I'm sorry, we're not going to talk about next year, we're going to talk a little bit more about Q4, as you like.

But the primary softening in Q4 is a function of lower utilization rates in some of our legacy customers, and we expect our NeuroStar system volume to come in as we expected to our guidance.

But the issue is that the rent to owns are significantly higher, and those are lower ASP.

So those are the fundamental drivers for us taking down the guidance next year -- I'm sorry, in Q4 this year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Got it.

Yes.

And so let's maybe hit on those 2 items a bit.

So first of all, legacy NeuroStar accounts, you referenced that maybe you're seeing some lower productivity than you expected.

Have you given or seen any consistent reasons why maybe a sense of profile or scale?

And then does that Q4 guidance assume that utilization within these legacy accounts improves from what you've seen in the third quarter, stay the same or gets worse?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Right.

Yes.

So the lower utilization really is a result of our over-indexed shift of the NPC team towards the recently sold systems.

If you think about it, we've installed 174 systems in the last 12 months, which the -- new systems and 280 over the last 7 quarters.

And what we're revisiting right now is the NPC call cycle has been shifted towards those 280 systems, and we need to go back and recircle on our legacy customer utilization.

I don't see this being a long-term issue.

These are experienced users who we need to revisit and review their practice development plans.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay.

And then just one last one in terms of leasing dynamic.

As we look out, do you see these sales-type leases increasing going forward?

And how should we really look at the mix of sales versus leases and the ROI of those investments?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CFO, VP of Finance &amp; Company Secretary   [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

So we offer the flexibility of a rent-to-own option for these reasons, is to minimize the upfront barriers to these larger accounts.

So we can -- so they can expand to new sites faster, which ultimately gets us to more treatment session sooner.

We would expect this trend to continue and I think that this further validates the strategy.

I would not categorize this as a fundamental shift in our strategy.

It's really a partner and execution of our existing customer segmentation strategy.

But you can expect this to continue to move forward -- to continue into Q4 and beyond.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Your next question comes from Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jason Richard Mills,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD of Research &amp; Analyst   [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Several questions, I'll try to limit it a little bit but.

Chris, talk about the competitive landscape.

We've seen growth slow here.

And we've also seen new competitors coming to the market over the last 12 months or so.

Has that had any impact or been one of the reasons we've seen slowing growth?

Could you just comment about wins or losses in the space and whether or not you've seen any regrettable departures of large customers or competitive ire is having any impact on your business at all?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes, Jason, thanks for the question.

So the fundamental competitive dynamics really hasn't changed very much as we look at how we're performing in the marketplace.

And I think that's really indicative of -- this is now our sixth consecutive quarter where we've increased the install base by 20%.

And so we feel like we're operating pretty well in the marketplace.

The primary drivers to the lower-than-expected guidance in Q4 is just a function of not lower systems placed and sold into the market, it's really around the ASP around those systems in the market and in a softening of our existing customers.

We have really -- when you think about the growth rate that we had over the last 7 quarters, 280 systems placed, that's putting a lot more demand on the NPCs.

And in a lot of businesses, and particularly in the pharmaceutical business, you have a sales call rotation with your reps, and you need to keep reinforcing behaviors.

And what we're starting to recognize is we were under-indexed with our legacy customers and we would expect it to not get better in Q4, and we're moving the NPC team on an increased call cycle for our existing customer base moving forward.

And we'll see how that plays out within that group.

But this is not a competitive issue.

I would say that this is -- when you look at the fundamentals of this business, our install base has grown 20%, the clinical performance is strong.

It's still a nascent untapped market, and this is just growing things as we've rapidly expanded and penetrated new customers.

And we got to get our call point ratio right between existing customers and new customers, and we're just a little bit off at the moment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jason Richard Mills,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD of Research &amp; Analyst   [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay.

I mean that makes some sense, Chris.

So how long do you expect, maybe you could give us a peek behind the curtain just a little bit.

And I'm going to push you a little bit on 2020 because otherwise, the Street is going to value you as a 10% grower and -- given your fourth quarter guidance.

And it sounds to me like you see yourself as something north of a 10% grower, and -- over the longer term.

But I guess the question is, how long does it take to sort of not change the business model, but adapt to the business model from a sales force perspective with these NPCs.

It sounds like the model's changing.

That the legacy providers were sort of left on their own volition and sort of they didn't fall down, but they slowed down.

And they need a bit more handholding, for a lack of a better way to put it.

And it sounds like you expect that once those changes are instituted and you are providing better support for legacy customers, that you see growth accelerating within those customers, which at this point in time is still a relatively material piece of your business, which is why it's being reflective in lower guidance in the nearer term.

Perhaps you could talk about those dynamics a little bit more and talk about what is the prudent way to model growth in the overall franchise in 2020, given the puts and takes.

And I understand you're not ready to give official guidance, but I think it behooves you to talk at least directionally.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Right.

So let me see if -- I'm going to try to help you out as best I can, Jason.

So what are we doing right now?

So we're assessing our deployment as part of our annual operating plan process.

And we know for sure that we're going to add in 2020, we got to rebalance some of our NPC territories.

We do this every year because of unequal and disproportionate number of new system sales going into 1 rep versus another.

So we're going to add more NPCs next year, we did it this past year as you know.

And I think the other thing is we need to look at either adding more CTCs and NPCs because the install base is increasing 20%, and just by definition, that means we're selling more systems year-over-year when your -- when that base is increasing 20% year-over-year.

And we got to find a better balance.

So we're very thoughtful, as you know.

So we're going through a process here over the last several weeks to understand our call cycle frequency and how much we move.

And then we're going to have to test and retest and see how fast we can move the needle on it.

The good news is, right -- this is not customers that we've lost, this is customers that have trended down.

They have a system.

They're committed to it.

And we just got to get back in there and revisit and review their practice development plans and reengage them.

So this is more of a behavior versus what I would call a material environmental issue around the business.

This is what I'd call just growing pains.

And we shifted the team potentially too hard to these new customers, these 280 new customers, and we've got to revisit the call cycle.

And I -- so this is going to take some time for us to figure out and test and retest, and we'll give you a better insight into it.

But let's be clear, I mean you can project the current Q4 revenues and compare that to Q1 and Q2 and that's not going to be a 10% grower, right?

The business is not going away.

We just have a softening in 1 segment of our customer market.

And you can see that we're adding systems as fast as we've ever had in the history of the company.

So the underlying fundamentals are strong.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jason Richard Mills,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD of Research &amp; Analyst   [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay.

Great.

And lastly, so it sounds like just to push on that a little bit more, it sounds like you're expecting the first half of the year to improve modestly relative to fourth quarter levels and that your comps are going to be easier in the second half of the year.

And with the addition of these new systems, it sounds like you might even see sequential improvement second half of '20 versus first half.

So improvement as you're moving through 2020.

Am I hearing that right?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Jason, we're focused on finishing the year, and we're in the process of creating our operating plan.

I can't really get into specifics around 2020 at this point in time.

I think we've got, again, a strong install base.

I've indicated in Q4 that the number of systems that we expect to install are in line with our prior guidance of 63 to 65, but we're taking our guidance down because of lower ASPs associated with those NeuroStar systems as we get into these bigger accounts, that the primary shortfall on NeuroStar's in Q4 and then further softening of our -- a subsegment of our customer group, which is our legacy customers.

And then that's going to take some time to square away, and I'm not quite sure how long it's going to take, but it's going to take us beyond Q4 probably to square that away.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Your next question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Chris, can you talk a little bit more about those legacy accounts?

I mean how do you really qualify what a legacy account is?

Is that something you've held for 2, 3 years?

Or is it -- and how do you think about what visibility do you have as far as what kind of opportunity you have there, if they've bought a competitive product and how quickly you can turn these guys back on?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

So when we think about the legacy customer group, we think about customers that acquired systems beyond 3 years and that they're up and running.

And one of the advantages we have versus maybe some other medical device companies is we have pretty good transparency because most of our NeuroStar treatment session volume is done through the cloud.

So we can see actual utilization trends over a period of time and see their purchases.

There you see the utilization real-time versus their purchases real time.

So what we're doing, Matt, is we're just going back.

We're looking at these customers, they fall into 3 groups, customers that are trending below our expectations at and above and what we're going back to is the people that are trending below our expectations that have the highest volume, the highest impact is where we're circling our NPCs back to.

We always factor in every year a number of, what we call, hybrid customers, customers that have competitive products in our product.

We also factor in lost business.

And we don't feel that those 2 metrics are off.

This is just a function of -- and again, I'll say, we've seen this before in my pharmaceutical days is you can call on your high-volume docs, but you've got to go back and continue to maintain, and I think that we've shifted too far towards the most recent install class and those 280 units that we put in over the last 7 quarters, and we just need to spend a bit more time with this customer group.

And remember, this legacy customer group is not the high-value target group, right?

These are the customers that we brought on in early days, and we just need to spend a bit more time with them.

And that's just another reason why we're moving to these higher volume targets because operationally, they can keep it rolling and these are smaller accounts, typically, that we -- our time and effort makes a difference in those accounts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay, that's helpful.

And then when you talk about maybe slicing this a little bit differently, the accounts you've added maybe over the last year that they have been using for a year to maybe up to 3 years.

So little bit more focused on the NPC side.

Do you have any sense, and I would imagine you do, given that it's all done in the cloud, what kind of growth you've seen from those accounts on the session side?

Has it been high teens, 20% kind of growth out of that group, maybe over the last year or so?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

We haven't aggregated -- we haven't disaggregated that on these calls.

But I will tell you that relative to guidance, they're performing as we expected, those groups.

I will go a step further and tell you that our fixed price contracted customers are growing significantly faster than our average customer in terms of utilization.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay.

And then one last one actually for Steve.

When you guys came public, the model was different.

And I think Jason got into some of the evolving market dynamics, so I won't go there here.

But with more and more of these sales-type leases coming out and some of the pricing pressure that we've seen, how do we think about gross margins going forward?

This is something we thought as you were coming public would be a metric that would be certainly (inaudible) and potentially falling a little bit?

Or how do we think about that in the future?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CFO, VP of Finance &amp; Company Secretary   [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

I think we have a couple dynamics that will impact gross margins going forward.

But there's puts and takes, and we really don't see much change from that mid-70 guidance perspective.

The sales-type leases will continue.

It's really a function of our partner growth in the future, something we don't have a lot of control over.

But we do have control over the expense aspect.

And we're at the point where we will be able to leverage our infrastructure from a service and support perspective.

So we feel the ASP decline will be able to be offset by the P&amp;L leverage.

So I wouldn't come off that mid-70 guidance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes, just like kind of add on is, the sensitivity around this business at this size, a couple percentage shift between NeuroStar treatment sessions and NeuroStar revenue because of the large gross margin difference with it can move the gross margin a couple of points.

And you can see in this quarter, our percentage of NeuroStar treatment sessions is slightly lower than it was this time last year, and NeuroStar's are a little bit higher.

And when that happens, you just see a shift down.

And then you also know that our international sales were up, and it's further compounded when the international sales are up and that's going to be a little bit lumpy and that can move us up 500 basis points as well from quarter-to-quarter.

So those are kind of the key drivers there.

And then we talked a little bit is -- a little bit about our price as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Your next question comes from Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Louis Turkaly,  JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Just on to the legacy customers, again, I just want to be clear, not any specific geography in the U.S. You said that you don't think there's any competitive impact.

And it really, based on your analysis, has to do with how long they've had them.

So if they've had them for longer, they're not seeing your reps as often.

Is that fair?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Dave, that is fair.

And so what we're seeing is that there's a little bit more time to maintain those customers than we anticipated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Louis Turkaly,  JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Got it.

And then you mentioned Greenbrook and Success as well.

What percent of your business today is covered by groups like that?

And I mean do we see this moving forward?

I'd love you to just take a guess at where is that going?

I mean are there going to be several more of these, do you think that becomes, I don't know, maybe even more significant part of your business, maybe 30%, 40% over time?

Any color you can give us there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

So we haven't really talked about that -- the number specifically, but when you think about -- when we think about fixed-price contracts, you can see how fast that aspect of our business is growing.

We haven't provided a specific number of systems or total installed base, but it's a little bit over 10% of our current installed base.

And that's the number of systems out there or in this fixed-price contract component.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Louis Turkaly,  JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Got it.

And I imagine you think that, that continues to build over the next couple of years as the companies grow, right?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

Yes.

So think about it, right?

Our customer segmentation strategy is focused on really the top 10% of the market that those -- that treats 1/3 of patients.

Well, that leaves 90 other -- 90% of market call points that we're not really actively calling on and these small doctors need to refer to somewhere.

And this has given rise to this service provider concept where that doctor needs a place that's TMS-only where they can refer to.

It's kind of like the orthopedic surgeon doesn't refer to an orthopedic surgeon with an MRI or x-ray.

And many of the largest, largest orthopedic centers have that, they refer to radiology group.

So in this way, the corollary is really these service providers are creating an opportunity for psychiatrists to TMS-only facility, meaning they just go there to get treated and come back, they don't have an option to get CVT therapy or get written a prescription.

And we see this as really a function also of our direct-to-consumer efforts, right, when patients around the country seeing NeuroStar advertised, they're depressed, they'll go into their existing psychiatrist, and we -- you all understand that this market is significantly underpenetrated.

And they'll go into these psychiatrists, and they just don't have a TMS, and they're looking to create an option for their patient to get treatment.

And moving it to these service providers is really how they create a continuum of care within their practice.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The first one for me maybe is just to start on guidance.

So in terms of the 2020 guidance, can you give us a sense of what you're modeling for average treatment revenue per system?

And what does that assume for some of the legacy accounts, maybe that you guys are trying to put some new strategies around to reaccelerate?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - Advisor   [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  So when we talk about average revenue per active system, so we see that there's a bit of seasonality and we would expect in Q1 slightly lower average revenue per active system.

And then it generally increases across the year to high, typically in the back half.

We believe it will be flat to slightly down because of higher installed base with slightly lower ASPs over the full year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay.

And the impact of those legacy accounts, maybe both for the second half of 2019, so we can get a sense of -- kind of that headwind.

And then what that could be over a matter of 2 or 4 quarters whenever you think that you can see some improvement there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - Advisor   [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

So we're monitoring that.

We've been in and we've assessed those accounts.

We understand what's attributing to the decline and the primary operational issues, Margaret, such as staff turnover, training new staff and one-off reimbursement challenges.

The sales force has identified what those are.

And over a period of time, we're tracking what we think our impact is going to be in those accounts.

The thing that's going to drive most of our increased utilization or our average revenue per active system in 2020 is really our ability to scale our most recent customers.

That will have the greatest impact on that number, as in all years.

So the systems that we put in last year will have the greatest impact on utilization across 2020.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay.

And just one last question for me.

In terms of kind of those latter -- that latter focus in terms of the bigger physician accounts and kind of the TMS-only centers.

Is there anything that has surprised you over the last few quarters?

And what do you think they can do and what can you do for them to continue to help scale going into 2020?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - Advisor   [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

So the TMS-only accounts -- just to give everyone a sense of where TMS-only fits in, there's about 5 companies out there, maybe several of those emerging.

Of the 5 that are out there, we believe that we know we have the primary market share within those accounts.

To give you a sense of the TMS-only, TMS-only really provides patient referrals to accounts that don't have a TMS system.

So our market focus right now is on 22% of the solo improved practices, which is about 5,700 of the 25,000 accounts that exist, and that's about 60% of the MDD patients in the segment.

And really, with the TMS-only providers, our playing is in the 78% of the accounts that we're not targeting that have about 40% of the MDD patients.

So this is how we address the entire market.

We are the primary partner for TMS-only.

And then we have our sales force, our BDM team selling on and selling into the highest potential single and group practices in 2020.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  And our next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Cecilia E. Furlong,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Associate   [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This is actually Cecilia on for Jason.

And I just wanted to ask about your recent strategy, shifting the focus from growing the BDM force and just your outlook beyond 2020.

I know you talked about mid-50s being kind of a target range for now.

But beyond 2020, as you expand indications, does this seem like the right size?

Or will you continue to evaluate that?

And just from an SG&amp;A standpoint in 2020, can you talk about the impact of really growing your force rather than the BDM size sales team?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - Advisor   [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay.

So to give you a sense of where we are with the BDM team in 2020.

On a weighted average in 2020, we had about in the high 40s of full-time equivalents for BDMs, and we believe, this year, we'll have BDMs in the mid-50s.

We also think that with the increase in the number of new accounts per reps, plus, we also are forecasting a slight increase in the number of second system sales.

For the last 24 months, we've been getting into larger accounts, and we are seeing higher rates of second system sales.

So we believe that with this modest increase year-over-year in BDMs with a slightly higher productivity rate, that we'll have a record 2020 in terms of new system sales for the year.

As it relates to beyond 2020, we're going to monitor and manage the business appropriately and we'll guide on 2021 in the future.

That said, we are shifting more resources to NPCs and CTCs to bring and improve our average revenue per active system and bring that metric more in line with our unit sales of 20%.

So that's the real big thrust for us here.

We'll chart the progress of those new NPCs and CTCs on impacting pull-through at the account level.

And then at the end of the year, we'll be really thoughtful and assess and then decide what we're going to do in 2021 and beyond.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Cecilia E. Furlong,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Associate   [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay.

Great.

And then, I guess, just also turning to revenue guidance.

Just what are you thinking in terms of capital ASP trends in 2020 as well as installed base growth that's factored into your guidance, especially as we continue to target these high-volume accounts?

And just how you're thinking about the mix in these accounts between sales and sales-type leases?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - Advisor   [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay.

So the question is, how are we thinking about top line growth.

So -- well, we think about it in 2 parts.

So as I mentioned, we think the productivity of BDMs will remain constant to slightly up.

So we expect a record-breaking year on the capital unit sales in 2020.

That said, we expect a slightly lower blended ASP, which is a function of the capital sales and the sales-type leases in 2020.

So the combination of those will create a little bit of downward pressure on ASPs for 2020 and we're not going to break out the mix between that.

We are giving you the total unit sales each and every quarter.

And as I mentioned, we've sold a significant number of systems over the last year.

And these systems have not ramped up to a steady state.

We know we have a much higher percentage year-over-year in systems that are less than 18 months.

So this lowers our overall average revenue per active system each and every quarter.

So while we're treating more -- and selling more treatment sessions year-over-year, the U.S. treatment session revenues are not growing in line with the active installed base because of that reason.

And we're looking to add NPCs and CTCs to close the gap on that.

We also expect slightly -- some slight downward pressure on our per click treatment sessions, ASPs to continue in 2020 as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  And our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Brien with Piper Sandler.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Andrew William Stafford,  Piper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division - Research Analyst   [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This is Drew on for Matt.

I just kind of wanted to go back to some of the utilization in the legacy accounts that impacted you last quarter.

It sounds like it didn't bounce back by too much in Q4 as you had expected.

But I guess the question is, did you see any improvement as the quarter went on in those accounts?

And then sort of what gives you confidence that it can improve going forward?

And then I guess, lastly, on that, I mean, mainly, can you give us a feel for what level of rep expansion to address this issue specifically has been incorporated into your OpEx guide?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - Advisor   [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Sure, Drew.

So for Q4, we did not expect to see any change in utilization in those accounts.

We are basically in there diagnosing and trying to understand what the circumstance is.

The good news is that most of this has been attributed to operational issues, as I just explained.

And these are well within the bailiwicks of the NPC, CTC and reimbursement team to resolve.

Short term, what we did is -- and [ARC's] currently doing is shifting the cull patterns of the NPCs that we have in the company now to spend more time on this group of customers.

And as you heard, what we plan to do is, to address this longer term, is we're increasing the number of NPCs to 7 and the number of CTCs to 2 to provide more touches to the existing customers while at the same time, being able to scale our ever-expanding and growing installed base.

So overall, that's how we're addressing that customer group.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Andrew William Stafford,  Piper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division - Research Analyst   [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay, that's helpful.

And then just on the international side, I guess, especially in Japan.

I know you're getting -- just getting started there, yet you had a difficult comp in Q4 of '18.

But obviously, a pretty large opportunity.

And it just kind of seems to be moving a little bit slow.

Are you making any additional investments to kind of speed up the process there?

And then, I guess, any impact from the coronavirus?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - Advisor   [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Okay.

Great.

So last year was a start-up year, right?

It's really the building and the beginning of the foundation.

We got approved in June.

And the purchases last year was really to create inventory for both NeuroStar and new NeuroStar treatment session.

This year is really all about the pull-through of that inventory and replacing an inventory and we'd expect to see orders of capital equipment across the entire year.

And then we gradually see increasing in NeuroStar treatment session purchases.

So this is really going about as planned.

We're pretty impressed with their early sales they've gotten in Japan.

They've gotten the leading key opinion leaders to purchase at their universities over there.

We're getting some really good national publicity over there.

So I think we're growing as we expect it to grow in that market.

That said, is we're not expecting significant growth in Japan based on what I just said.

Most of the inventory that was sold, most of the sales last year was to build inventory.

It wasn't the pull-through of inventory.

And then this year, we'll see that pull-through of inventory.

They have added incremental sales reps to the organization in the back half of last year, and that looks promising as well.

And remember, we do not fund any of the SG&amp;A for this operation in Japan.

Teijin is responsible for that part of the business planning and investment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  And our last question comes from the line of Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Louis Turkaly,  JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  And just going back to the legacy account, the 100 or so we talked about last quarter.

It looked like the attrition was something like 25 in this quarter, fourth quarter.

And I was wondering if you could just comment on -- are you culling some of those older accounts and what you expect that -- it's a little higher than, say, what you've averaged in the past.

Just maybe color on what you expect in 2020 for that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - Advisor   [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Right.

So it was a little higher in the fourth quarter, and it's typically a little bit higher in the fourth quarter for the last several years.

And remember, when an account goes inactive, that means they haven't bought a treatment session for us -- from us in 12 months.

So these are usually decisions that happened in the fourth quarter of the prior year.

So it seems that there's a little bit or slightly higher business decisions are made about closing a practice, stop providing TMS as a service line and/or moving to a competitive system.

Those seem to have happened more often at the end of the fourth quarter.

So it's slightly higher this quarter than our prior 3 quarters.

We don't anticipate that run rate continue.

We believe it will go down to probably somewhere around 1.5% a quarter, somewhere in that range, give or take, a quarter or a half each and every quarter.

So we're not proactively culling it.

And remember, this is -- most of these are people that are getting out of practice or can't make TMS work.

And that's one of the reasons why we have evolved our strategy in the last 24 months to get into higher volume accounts that have more back-office capabilities and greater capacity to operationalize a NeuroStar in their practice.

And most, if not many of these, are legacy customers that have decided not to continue with the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy or have gone out of practice.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Louis Turkaly,  JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Got it.

And then just looking to the guidance, actually, the revenue commentary, the breakout.

Just curious to break out operating lease but not the sales-type that's now included in the capital.

I guess the logic there, I'm just curious if you would even comment sort of on how sizable that sales-type lease could be in that capital sales and why break out operating if you think that's trending towards 0?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CFO   [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes, Dave.

We're trying to move away from the financing differentiation of systems sold.

So going forward, we're going to report systems sold and the total revenue for those systems and really get away from differentiating between sales-type lease and traditional capital sales.

It really is just, really, capital acquisition strategies for our customers.

And as a reminder, we only offer sales-type leases to our large TMS-only service providers.

Our strategy is to free up their capital so they can continue on with their expansion plans and not have their monies tied up with the system acquisition costs.

And so those -- that subsegment will continue to grow and will grow at a higher rate than traditional capital equipment sales in 2020, somewhere north of 30%.

And that's why you'll see some fluctuation in the ASPs as that mix changes quarter-to-quarter.

But again, we feel it's more important to get installed base growing north of 20% like we've done in the past 7 quarters.

And ultimately, the treatment session volumes will catch up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Louis Turkaly,  JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Got it.

And I think last quarter, you gave sort of an update on Greenbrook, Success, some of the others.

Just curious if you could provide any update on sort of the mix for the TMS-only providers today?

I mean I imagine it increased again, but just directionally, I imagine that continues in 2020.

But any update on the size of those guys for you today?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - Advisor   [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes.

Thanks, Dave.

So as it relates to some of these large TMS-only accounts like Greenbrook and Success TMS, we prefer for them to comment on their earnings calls as it relates to their performance in the marketplace.

But we're delighted to partner with these groups.

We think that our value proposition really resonates with this group.

We have significant investments in field service engineering, tech support, and our TrakStar system provides them real-time insights into their locations, utilization of their systems.

So we think our value proposition on many fronts really resonates with this group.

We're not going to be breaking them out on a go-forward basis.

And they'll be part of our overall NeuroStar treatment session revenue and our NeuroStar capital revenue.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  And this concludes today's question-and-answer session.

I would now like to turn the call back to Chris Thatcher for closing remarks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - Advisor   [26]

Operator   [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

This concludes today's conference call.

Thank you for participating.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maybe, first, to start out, we can dive into the sales and marketing spend and the changes you guys are making there.

So first, can you give us details in terms of how many BDMs do you have as well as on NPC CTCs and whether you're keeping that structure or not?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 We are maintaining that structure.

I would say the most significant change we have made to the sales organization was integrating those 3 functions vertically.

Prior to early March, we had a different management structure.

Now we feel going more vertical with BDMs, NPCs and CTCs under the same manager was the more efficient approach and extremely timely, given the environment we're operating in.

The specific numbers, I don't think of that relevant at this point, but we do -- we will be maintaining that same type of structure and support to our customers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay.

Yes.

So part of it is the impact of what that means for kind of 2 types of accounts that you guys have, so you referenced focusing primarily on those TMS-only accounts.

But on the same token, we've seen a little bit of pressure on the legacy accounts over the last few quarters.

So maybe you can give us a sense of how you're strategically changing the focus on that as well as the percentage of sales that those accounts could represent, will be represented?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sure.

Yes, in 2019, we did see a significant shift in sales to the TMS-only service partners and we are forecasting that to continue into 2020 and 2021.

These entities are very self-sufficient and don't need the level of support that stand-alone practices or psychiatrists require.

So we are able to redirect some of our BDM time to our traditional customer base.

From an MPC and CTC perspective, it's pretty much the same type of model.

Again, those service providers are again self-sufficient and have great business models and are able to conduct their business without a lot of our support.

Obviously, we do offer training and other types of support to those partners.

But they are less reliant on the Neuronetics' offerings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay.

I think the question for me is more focused on the legacy accounts.

So those would be the accounts that I assume maybe were closed a little bit more or maybe aren't giving as much TMS treatment during this environment.

So between that and maybe less support potentially coming to them, does that mean that that segment can grow or is it going to decline for a bit while you guys refocus back on those TMS-only accounts?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes.

During our last conference call, Malgorzata, we did indicate that we had a program in place to address those legacy accounts.

We highlighted the top 150 and our MPCs have been working with each of those legacy accounts.

Again, a lot of these operational issues that led to some of those volume declines were, I would say, easily addressed by our MPC team and hopefully they can get those legacy accounts back to the volumes where they were prior to that drop-off that we saw in Q3 and Q4 of '19.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Your next question comes from the line of Marie Thibault from BTIG.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Marie Yoko Thibault,  BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Director &amp; Digital Health Analyst   [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Just a follow-up on Margaret's question, I'm curious what you saw in the first 2 months of the quarter when things were a little bit normal in terms of the success of efforts to increase utilization of the legacy accounts.

Any color you can give us there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Not specifically, but again as we communicated on the call, the expectations as late as March 13, where we were going to achieve the guidance that we had previously offered at $13.5 million to $14 million, a lot of the inputs from the field, both from BDMs and MPCs were that at least until that point the impact on from COVID-19 wasn't really material, and then all of a sudden, that last 2.5 weeks of March volume declines were extremely material.

I will say that the program that we put in place was still relatively early in Q1.

So it would be difficult to forecast those results but we did have a well-formalized program to again get those volumes back to where we saw them in the early part of 2019.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Marie Yoko Thibault,  BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Director &amp; Digital Health Analyst   [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay, sure.

And then with a couple of states or some states opening last week, are you seeing any customers in those geographies?

I guess any early color you can tell us about centers reopening or treatment session volumes?

And interested by the idea of an uptick and more patients coming out of this quarantine and needing the mental health help, are you positioning for any new marketing efforts around that with your customers?

Anything you can tell us about that would be helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 So regarding the states that are starting to ease the restrictions, yes, our customers that are seeing those easings are starting to restart the business.

Speaking with our TMS-only providers, they really haven't skipped a beat, they've really been pushing to maintain their treatment session volumes.

I think the one area being hardest hit still is the Chicago area that's slowing a little bit of progress there.

But all in all, I think you're seeing a general slow reopening of those centers, the 33% that had ceased treatment.

One of the key indicators that we look at -- so we track sales, utilization, but also the MT or motor-threshold starts; and we did see a nice uptick towards the end of April that would indicate to us that it's not a 100% correlated, but it is correlated to the new patient starts, which you would think would lead to a bit of a recovery as we head into May and June.

So we are seeing some signs that we are gradually starting that uptick.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Marie Yoko Thibault,  BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Director &amp; Digital Health Analyst   [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 And then anything on marketing for new patients?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes.

So we have started some, I would say more strategic focused marketing efforts.

Again, we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, again trying to preserve cash and being unsure of the length and the magnitude of COVID-19, but we did see in April the incidence of depression scripts spiked up significantly and 75% of those scripts were for new patients.

So following the treatment protocol of TMS being indicated for one failed drug, you can envision a potential increase in TMS treatments towards the latter half of 2020.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Your next question comes from Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I guess just to start with your various customers out there, you've got the TMS-only providers, the chains, you've got the independent providers as well.

Can you just talk about their ability to ramp back up from a capital perspective to get back going?

I know in the past you've had some--one of your chain providers actually gave your systems back, is that a potential headwind we could see if some people decide that they just can't make a go of it in this environment that we could see over the next several quarters?

So just how the things go out here from a patient treatment perspective as been to Q3 and then capital perspective, is it more expecting very little capital sales Q2, Q3, maybe a little bit more in Q4?

Just that general ecosystem, how do we think about things progressing there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes, I think our existing customers will be in the best position to restart since they already have the capital in place.

Again, depending upon the duration of some of the social distancing and stay-at-home orders some of the lower-volume customers could be impacted more than others.

I think one of the fallouts of this pandemic could be some consolidation depending upon the customers' both economic and just overall willingness to continue with TMS.

I just think it's too early to tell.

We do have a number of third-party financing partners that are still willing to lend to our customers.

And so at least from that financing perspective, that hasn't dried up at this point and I know our sales team is still out there, pushing for transactions and selling as many NeuroStars as they can.

So I do think the environment will likely change.

Again, it really depends on how long this last and what the economic impact is to our customers.

But I was going to say the TMS-only partners, they probably are and the larger facilities are in the best shape to come out of this even stronger.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay.

So I know you're in cash preservation mode, but you're much better capitalized than many of your other competitors in this space.

And so I'm curious, you've got flexible financing plans available for customers.

So is there an opportunity with some maybe wounded competitors to get some of that share away from them in this environment, maybe near term and maybe that being a little bit of a backstop for our system placements goal?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I mean that possibility exists.

And so Matt, making these difficult decisions and reducing our workforce, it certainly wasn't easy.

But Andy and I, as soon as we saw some of the indicators in mid-March really start to decline, knowing that 2 of our more valuable assets were our commercial team and our strong balance sheet, we really wanted to make sure that we were in a great position to come out of this whenever the end of the pandemic comes.

And so yes, part of that strategy, could be maybe being a bit more aggressive on the sales side, using that strong balance sheet to our advantage when it comes to sales and understanding that customers are making their purchasing decisions, not only on our best-in-class technology but also on the longevity of the company, and who is likely to survive and thrive once this is all behind us.

So yes, that is certainly a possibility.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay.

And then just one more from me if you don't mind, just the reductions across the organization, we're a little bit steeper than I was expecting, again I know you guys are trying to preserve cash, the smart move but again, a little steeper than I expected.

So as we come out of this, what kind of grower is Neuronetics?

And how do you support your customers?

Because a big part of the store really is your customer support and everything else like that; so what happens to the organization from here and what kind of grower do you look like?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I really think part of that will be dictated by the level of economic recovery.

Similar to a lot of industries, there's just a lot of unknown as to what the fallout will be.

But the one thing we did do was in -- and share our financial ability to weather this storm and I agree we were, I would say, extremely aggressive with what we did in late March and early April.

And it really was to preserve the company.

You know, assuming things got back to normal or close to what normal was pre COVID, I think the company again with would be growing along the lines of what we previously communicated.

And again with the increase in depression prescriptions during March and April, it is reasonable to think that some of that increase will eventually head towards TMS Therapy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Your next question comes from Cecilia Furlong from Canaccord Genuity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Cecilia E. Furlong,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Associate   [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I just wanted to ask again just about your sales force specifically from a territory perspective and from a BDM perspective, kind of what you're seeing now after the reductions, but then more so longer term, what you see as kind of coverage-at-scale level, especially given your new kind of focus within just HVT?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 So the territory realignment is still a work in process at this point.

We still view the territory alignment based on opportunities, density, the amount of coverage that BDM can appropriately cover as well as a bit of productivity in the back of our minds.

We do think that once those territories are fully aligned that the BDMs will have the opportunity to both make money and also service the accounts that they're assigned.

So at this time and again -- with the increase in TMS-only providers, some of that opportunity within those territories really is deflected to those partners.

And so again, we think with the vertical management integration and that support structure our BDMs will be able to be more efficient and also more productive, and we do reserve the right or ability to add back resources as the economic environment unfolds.

This really was, I would say, a very aggressive action to secure our balance sheet, but we will not jeopardize the service offerings that we have in place for our customers.

And so if we see strains or pressures within the commercial organizations, we do reserve the right to add those resources to assist our customers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Cecilia E. Furlong,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Associate   [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Great.

And if I could also ask just within the reduced spending this year, just how you're thinking about R&amp;D, specifically the NextGen system and your pipeline initiatives -- bipolar being the primary one -- but just how kind of these reductions may play out on timelines in that perspective.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes.

From an R&amp;D perspective, the projects that we had in place at the beginning of the year are still in place.

I will say we did slow some of the spending in R&amp;D. Again and late March in April, it's the duration and the severity of COVID that we didn't fully understand.

So we didn't think it was prudent to go out and kind of execute on our original plan that was in place what we had our original 2020 plan in place.

But that's still exists and is an ongoing project.

Regarding the other indications, again, we've communicated in the past and we continue with discussions with the FDA.

Obviously the pandemic has redirected some of the FDA resources.

Honestly, they have a lot more on their plate with COVID-19 than worrying about how we're going to structure our clinical trial with bipolar, but those discussions do continue, and we are hopeful and optimistic that we can come up with a collaborative resolution and see where that heads in the future.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 A few for me.

Just to start, COVID -- the COVID updates you guys gave are pretty meaningful.

Sounds like maybe the new patient starts are nearly back to normal.

So first, can we say that it's fair to call new starts between 90% and 100% of pre-COVID levels?

And then second, how long does it take for those new patient starts at this rate to get treatment revenue back to that pre-COVID level?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 So thanks for the question, Margaret.

And yes, it is safe to say that the current new patient starts are at pre-COVID levels.

And so we are anticipating those favorable trends to continue throughout Q3 and Q4, assuming we don't get hit with a second stage.

Obviously, once the new patient starts -- traditionally, 97% of those patients will continue through the approximately 36 treatment sessions for the therapy.

And so again, we are forecasting that, I would say, modest sequential growth to continue throughout 2020.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay.

And that sounds a little conservative to us, especially on the back of what the reimbursement decisions that you did talk about this quarter.

Can you give us any background on those?

How long were you working on them?

And how do you compare these relative to some of the prior reimbursement decisions that you guys have had?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes.

So we have an employee dedicated on working with our providers to ensure that the reimbursement does get to the levels that were indicated, which is one failed drug treatment.

So these are really ongoing efforts and not something that was more definitive in terms of a time line.

And I expressed this during our last call.

I mean this is critically important really for the patients.

If the payers are requiring 4 failed drugs for reimbursement, it could take a patient between 12 and 24 months of failed drugs, which accompany multiple side effects potentially before they're able to get to TMS therapy.

And so we view the 4 failed drugs to 2 as being a huge step for these 3 payers.

Again, ultimately, it would be great if we could get consistent reimbursement coverage for the indication of one failed drug, but those efforts do continue on a daily basis, and we are extremely pleased with those decisions in the second quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay.

Yes.

And then last one, if I could.

Keith, you've been around a while.

We've known you for a while at ZELTIQ.

How would you compare maybe your initial thought processes going into ZELTIQ versus Neuronetics?

And as you think about where you're going to spend your time over the next 12 months, is it customer focused?

Is it reimbursement decisions?

And what would you define as a success a year from now?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Well, good to hear your voice, Margaret.

It's been a while.

I think that -- as I mentioned in my remarks, I think there's an opportunity to build greater awareness within the patient community on TMS.

And I think that to date, the company has done a good job, but I think we need to update the market research to find out who is our target audience today and then how to get to them.

So I think we are doing the call center.

We're doing digital and social marketing.

But I think over the next 12 months, we'll be able to refine that and be able to do a better job at targeting those patients and building the awareness.

Secondly is also helping the accounts themselves, be able to bring those patients in and then convert them.

So it's similar to the opportunity that was at ZELTIQ.

There's always a little nuances with each business, but I think that there is a chance -- a strong chance -- that we can take some of the learnings from that and apply them here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Your next question is from Matt O'Brien with Piper Sandler.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Andrew William Stafford,  Piper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division - Research Analyst   [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This is Drew on for Matt.

I wanted to push just a little bit on the COVID trend for some of your downstream customers.

Obviously, good to hear on the new patient side.

I understand that patient throughput may be a little bit more challenging as there are a lot of numerous requirements for bringing the patient back in office.

But I guess just stepping back a little bit, what brings the 20% of [signaries] that you mentioned that are closed back online?

I mean is that primarily related to regional outbreaks of COVID?

Is there any concern that some of them could be permanent closures or something else?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes.

What we're seeing, Drew, is it's really geographically focused at this point.

So there are still significant hotspots throughout the country, and a lot of those states are actually where we have a lot of NeuroStar systems.

So we don't anticipate a lot of permanent shutdowns, but some of these centers are obviously still impacted by local and governmental restrictions.

So it may take them longer to restart.

Again, if you look at Illinois and Chicago, that one in particular has been slower than most to restart and regain the traction.

But ultimately, as we work through the pandemic, we do believe that the majority of customers that are presently shut down will come back online.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Andrew William Stafford,  Piper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division - Research Analyst   [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay.

That's helpful.

And then I just was wondering if you could kind of speak to some of your priorities to COVID here.

You've made some adjustments on the expense side.

It sounds like you (inaudible) capital environment would be just a little bit more challenging for a little while here.

Are your customers receptive to the operating lease type model in this kind of environment still?

And then, I guess, are there any plans to push a little more aggressively on the treatment session side with some of your existing customers to help offset any weakness you might see in capital?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sure.

I mean we don't offer operating lease financing.

What we have is what we term sales type leases, which prior to 2019 could be considered operating leases.

But we only offer them to a handful of customers.

It's really just targeted towards the TMS-only service providers.

Again, our strategy with that subgroup of customers is to make sure they preserve their capital so they can continue to expand as opposed to tying up hundreds of thousands of dollars in NeuroStar capital equipment sales, which could slow their expansion efforts.

So it's a very strategic partnership with our largest customers.

Secondly, regarding ASPs on treatment sessions, no.

The -- we don't see discounting being necessary.

The reimbursement for our treatment sessions -- and again, this varies by payer and also geography so it's certainly not the same amount of reimbursement throughout the country, but it is a very favorable economic picture for psychiatrists and other customers.

Again, even if you assume an average of $200 reimbursement per treatment sessions, the payback on our machines is about a patient in a year or 7 patients a year.

So it is -- they are pretty quick to pay these machines off.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Your next question is from the line of Cecilia Furlong with Canaccord Genuity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Cecilia E. Furlong,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Associate   [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Great.

I guess I just wanted to start off with what you saw in Q2 in terms of rebound but really focusing on the TMS-only centers and just their ability to rebound on a relative basis versus some of your smaller customers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sure.

I mean, obviously, the Greenbrooks of the world and Success TMS, they're are extremely large entities and better equipped to weather the COVID-19 pandemic.

Obviously, they were impacted as we all were, but the TMS-only service providers have certainly recovered quicker than some of the smaller facilities.

And that's really due to their scale and expertise and changing the way they treat patients.

And for example, people don't wait -- or patients don't wait in waiting rooms anymore.

It's a very continuous flow through the facilities.

So you don't have people in the same room potentially spreading diseases.

And so they were able to optimize their workflow and really get ahead of the recovery efforts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Cecilia E. Furlong,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Associate   [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Great.

And I guess if I could also ask just on your high-level thoughts on OpEx beyond 2020.

Early R&amp;D, your focus there specifically and the relative priority in the pursuit of PTSD and bipolar depression indications.

I know you commented briefly in your prepared remarks, but just any further color you could give around -- your thoughts around priority of those 2 objectives.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes.

So in April, when we saw the precipitous decline in treatment session utilization as well as new patient starts, we took the swift and decisive action to reduce our expenses.

We did communicate that that was for cash preservation, and we would not restart investments until we were comfortable that we were out of the COVID environment.

The recent trends certainly indicate we're heading in a favorable direction, and even the July data was pretty impressive.

But we really don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves in terms of 2021.

So this is something that Keith, I and the rest of the senior team are looking at, again, planning for a restart, but again, not getting too, too far ahead of ourselves.

We've had ongoing conversations with the FDA that have been very positive.

But until we get comfortable with their position and opinions on clinical trial structure and things like that, we're not prepared to really launch something that lengthy and that expensive.

Regarding our next-gen platform, again, that was slowed, but it's still on the radar.

And these are the decisions that we'll work through during our planning process, which starts next month.

 Our next question is from the line of Marie Thibault with BTIG.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Marie Yoko Thibault,  BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Director &amp; Digital Health Analyst   [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Welcome, Keith.

Nice to have you here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Marie Yoko Thibault,  BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Director &amp; Digital Health Analyst   [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I want to ask a question on the capital sales this quarter.

They were actually a bit better than we had feared.

And so I wanted to get a little bit more granularity on those system sales, the types of centers those were going into and if there's any additional detail you could give us along those lines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes.

Again, given the environment of Q2, we were pretty impressed with the ability of our BDMs to transact that many systems.

You would also expect to see, I think, a more focus on the TMS-only centers.

When we looked at the data, the percentage of TMS-only versus, I would say, traditional facilities didn't vary from previous quarters.

And so it was just our traditional mix between regular psychiatrists and those TMS-only centers.

We do think that there could be an increased focus on TMS-only as we get into Q3 just based on their ability to recover quicker than some of the other facilities, but we'll have to see how that plays out in the quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Marie Yoko Thibault,  BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Director &amp; Digital Health Analyst   [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay.

Great.

And I guess I wanted to dig a little bit on your commentary about a lot of systems and some of those hotspot states.

Do you have kind of a general breakout of how many or what proportion of systems fit in the South and West, some of those states that are being hardest hit right now?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 So we actually -- we do have the ability to monitor everything on a state-by-state basis, and we actually do look at utilization trends every day.

And so yes.

Naturally, our highest density states are Illinois, Chicago, Texas, California, and essentially, many of the states that are getting hit hard again.

But again, our customers have figured out the optimal way to safely treat patients and also keep their staff safe.

And so we haven't seen a significant impact even in those states.

They've certainly recovered at a very impressive rate since the low point in May.

And again, those trends have continued into the month of July.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 That concludes our question-and-answer session for today.

I would now like to turn the call back over to Keith Sullivan for closing remarks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you.

Thank you, operator.

Thanks again for joining us today.

While it's early in my tenure, I'm very impressed with the team we have and our ability to move quickly and adapt.

For the balance of the year, we will be heads down focused on executing in a dynamic environment, while at the same time, looking to the future and putting a long-term strategy in place.

I look forward to updating you on our progress on our next quarterly call.

Thank you for joining.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Research Analyst   [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I guess, Keith, can we start with the realignment plans on the BDM and NPC side of things?

You've seen these in the past.

I'm assuming that you're getting a look under the hood now and that's the conclusion that you've drawn probably in collaboration with Sara.

But seeing these historically, typically, isn't just 6-month period to really refine the sales force and change territories, et cetera, before you really see a meaningful improvement.

It's typically more like a year or more than that.

So I guess what gives you the confidence you're going to really start to see the improvement in the second half of next year?

And then how do you really make sure that your larger TMS provider customers are comfortable with how things are being adjusted?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks, Matt.

I think the analysis that we did of the sales organization is that we have a pretty good team in place.

And that when we are restructuring the sales organization, we're really redefining what the BDM territories would look like.

We're balancing them so that they will each have a specific number of psychiatrists involved in them.

So right now, we -- because of the realignment earlier in the year, there are much -- there are some territories that are very large and some that are very small.

So on the BDM side, we balance them.

On the NPC side, again, I think we have a talented group that's out there.

And what we're trying to do is make them more effective in the field by also balancing them to have about between 30 and 35 accounts each.

So we are going to provide training throughout January and at our sales meeting on how we can best utilize the data from our market research.

But we're not overhauling the sales organization, we're just trying to make them more efficient.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Research Analyst   [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay.

All right.

That's really helpful.

And then, I mean, just to put a little bit finer point.

On the said guidance that you're providing for Q4 is a little bit below the street, certainly not the end of the world.

But as we think about the first half of next year, should we still think about a contracting business for the first couple of quarters and then hopefully getting back to -- even to growth next year, assuming that we don't have another big outbreak of COVID?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes.

Matt, this is Steve.

No, we're still budgeting and planning for a rebound in 2021.

I know the expectations are to get back to either at or above 2019 levels and that is something we're certainly not shying away from.

Obviously, there's still some economic and pandemic dependencies.

But no, with the revamped commercial structure along with the revised strategy, we're looking at growth to return in 2021.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Research Analyst   [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Got it.

And just one more for me.

I know this is probably a little bit further out question.

But Keith, your commentary about the first-line therapy is obviously extremely interesting and compelling.

I mean, what steps need to happen to get to that point?

And then I know this is a difficult question to answer, but can you just frame up a potential time frame for when something like this could, even just a few insurance providers, be the first-line of therapy rather than drug?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matt, that's a question that we talk about almost daily here.

I think we are digging into our TrakStar data where we have 72,000 patients.

And in our registry, which is a subset of that, we have over 5,000 patients.

So we are looking at that data to be able to help put the information into a formula that can be used by the societies to take to the payers.

And I have no idea what the time frame on that is.

I think we should have a handle on our data in the next several months.

But how long the payers take to react to it?

I don't know.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Your next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brandon Vazquez,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Associate   [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This is Brandon on for Margaret.

If I could just follow-up on that last question first.

As we look to a rebound in the business and you get to 2021 and creating more of a sustainable kind of growth rate, do you think you need to have some of these market access wins in order to hit your internal goals?

Or can just some reconfiguring and refining of the commercial organization be enough to kind of make a more sustainable growth profile?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 So what I will tell you is in the research that we have backed so far is our opportunity just in treating MDD is large, and the number of physicians that are not using NeuroStar Advanced Therapy at this point is also large.

So I think we have a large amount of runway to go without any other indications.

But I think we have an opportunity to advance the ball on a couple of different fronts.

We all know that it's going to take time with the FDA and then with the payers, but I think we're starting to move forward on those fronts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brandon Vazquez,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Associate   [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Got it.

And then as we look towards kind of on the system utilization side and the system revenue side -- or sorry, rather the treatment revenue side.

Steve, you had mentioned it needs a little over $10,000 per active system as the year-over-year comp.

As we go moving forward into '21, should we think about the system base or the installed base able to reach kind of a $10,000 plus number?

And then as we kind of look at a sustainable 2021 plus, is $10,000 kind of a floor?

Can we look for upside there or is that kind of a level where we level out?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes.

Brandon, our expectations are to continue to increase utilization throughout the period near term.

You saw about a year ago, we felt the initial utilization declines and had plans in place to address it, and then COVID hit and really limited our ability to go out and work with the customers who saw those declines.

We fully expect to reengage those customers as well as others with our NPCs and co-marketing programs and other awareness tools to drive well beyond that $10,000 average revenue per system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brandon Vazquez,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Associate   [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Got it.

And just one last one for me.

I appreciate there's probably some noise going on in the Japan business given COVID.

But any updates there, even just anecdotal feedback?

How the commercialization is going there?

And any updates on the potential reimbursement update?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks, Brandon.

So in Japan, we do have reimbursement today and there are a couple of things happening.

Our distributor is selling systems at a controlled placement model.

He is making sure that all of the training is done properly, and he is beginning to conduct our post-market study in the 20 hospitals that we have agreed to do.

So there's activity in Japan.

It is on a controlled pace.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Your next question comes from the line of Bill Plovanic with Canaccord.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 William John Plovanic,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Analyst   [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Just first, if we could talk about the systems.

As you roll them out, how does COVID impact your new account strategy as it relates to the chains versus the independent operators?

We've heard some of the larger chains are holding back on some of their capital spend and I don't know if this has adjusted your strategy as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Good to hear your voice, Bill.

We've been in touch with our service providers and their business is growing at this point.

So I think our individual psychiatrists and our service providers have put the policies and procedures in place to be able to handle the COVID situation.

And so they have their patients wait in the waiting room -- in the car before they bring them in, there's no waiting in the waiting room.

So I think that's under control.

So I think I had a meeting with Greenbrook's senior leadership team and they are placing systems now.

So...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 William John Plovanic,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Analyst   [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay.

So -- but you talked about it a little bit just in your opening remarks regarding kind of the balance of shifting back to the individual operators versus the chains.

Is this and then -- but should we expect that there's going to be more focus or more drive into the individual going forward, just to balance it out a little more?

Or will it move one way or another, I guess, is what I'm trying to figure out?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Well, I think our business today is about 50-50, and we're providing the same level of help and assistance and awareness to individual psychiatrists as well as the service providers.

So I don't think we're trying to shift it in one direction or the other, I think it's in our benefit and theirs to increase treatment sessions to individuals and the providers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 William John Plovanic,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Analyst   [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay.

And then in terms of the treatment sessions.

Obviously, you've come back to about $8,100 per system per quarter.

And I'm trying to understand if -- to get back to that $10,000, I think you said about 10% of them aren't treating patients.

Was there any difference as you went through July and September, October?

Are you seeing more and more come on?

Because I'm just trying to figure out the cadence of this.

And when would you expect to back to 100% of your customers operating?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes.

That's a good question, Bill.

And we just finished up and received October's data, which was extremely impressive and exceeded our own internal expectations.

We did see, I would say, a healthy number of sites that had embraced telemedicine restart their TMS platforms in the month of October.

And again, we're hopeful that, that momentum can continue through the end of the year.

But it was a really strong month.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 William John Plovanic,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Analyst   [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 So it kind of sounds that some of the guidance provided might just be conservatism, given the -- given what's going on with the third wave of the COVID.

I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it's just that's kind of the takeaway I'm getting.

Is that a fair assessment?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I think that's fair, yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 William John Plovanic,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Analyst   [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay.

And then just last question for me is, on the operating expenses, you've really done an amazing job cutting back the costs and making the cash you have last a long time.

And I think that's something that people may have been concerned about and I can see that you've done a great job there.

But as we look at Q3, any onetime charges and any of the operating lines that we should think about that might go away in Q4?

Or alternatively, given COVID, not as much T&amp;E going on, maybe not as much marketing support that you have had to provide, what have you, where are the lever points in that off-line from both the plus and the minus we should think about as you drive into the end of the year and next year?

And that's all my questions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes.

Q3, from an expense perspective, was very normal.

So no significant out of the ordinary entries.

Going forward -- again, so we cut very deeply in April and May and now are, I would say, very strategically adding resources.

I don't think you'll ever see us back to where we were from an operating expense perspective anytime soon.

And so from a marketing side, a lot of the expenses are being reallocated to different programs.

So not necessarily incremental spend.

In Q4, I think we'll see some incremental spend as we roll out our programs and new campaigns in 2021.

And then from a sales perspective, again, the increases to the team, I would term, is modest.

And we're not going to go back to the days of 59 BDMs in 2021.

There'll be a handful on both teams.

So I think what you saw in Q3, there'll be an uptick in Q4, which is reflective in the guidance.

And that will continue into 2021 as we drive growth.

We're certainly not going to be in a position to spend ahead of revenue.

So we want to make sure that the efforts we put in place in 2020 were valued and we won't get ahead of ourselves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Your next question comes from the line of Marie Thibault with BTIG.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Marie Yoko Thibault,  BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Director &amp; Digital Health Analyst   [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maybe I could start with one there on the discussion of adding back modestly to the teams with some new BDM and NPC hires.

What's the ideal profile for these positions?

Is it different than you've typically hired in the past?

And then, I guess, a related question with all these -- a few realignments happening.

Keith, could you tell us a little bit about what morale feels like right now at Neuronetics?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay.

So on the BDM side, we're going to be looking for people that have capital equipment experience, preferably capital equipment that also has a trailing revenue piece.

On the NPC side, it's a relationship builder that's able to go into the accounts, gain the trust and be able to walk in and help them through their marketing efforts, train them on how to work with their front desk staff, their consultation of patients and teach them how to do digital and social media and get their practice up and running.

So I think the morale in the organization, both inside and outside, is high.

I think we have a plan.

We have given it to our teams on a very high level.

And I think over the next couple of months as we roll it out, I think there'll be a higher level of excitement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Marie Yoko Thibault,  BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Director &amp; Digital Health Analyst   [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 That's great to hear.

I want to ask a follow-up on the capital equipment side, along the lines of what Bill was asking about.

It does sound like some buying have come back from the psychiatric practices.

Could you characterize who is buying or who is doing well enough, I guess, at this point to think about equipment sales?

And then of the remaining 10% of customers that have stayed close, are they waiting for a vaccine?

Or is there some other time line that you consider for them coming back online?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Marie, this is Steve.

So with respect to the 10%.

And so we did survey our NPCs who contacted the subset of customers directly.

And the vaccine was one of the overarching themes.

Again, they want to be very responsible for their staff and patients and have really moved away from bringing patients in-house.

And so that will continue to be a pressure as we exit Q4 until folks are comfortable with a vaccine if it does come in 2021.

In terms of whose purchasing systems.

Again, we mentioned in the call that there's not a lot of difference between the number of systems sold to the TMS-only providers and the traditional psychiatrists.

We do analyze this data and just to see if we can see any trends.

But it's -- the sales in Q3 were really along historical lines.

And then even in the month of October where we did a fair amount of system sales, again, those ratios were pretty consistent to what we've seen in the past couple of years.

It's not easy for an individual psychiatrist to make the capital equipment purchasing decision in this environment.

There's a significant amount of trust and validation that they must go through to acquire a system in this environment.

So we continue to support them and the TMS-only providers as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 That concludes the question-and-answer session for today.

I will now turn the call over back to Mr. Keith Sullivan for closing remarks.

 Thank you, operator, and thanks again for joining us on the call today.

I look forward to updating you on our progress in the next quarterly call.

And I hope you're safe.

Thank you.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of John Newman with Canaccord.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Lawrence Newman,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Principal &amp; Senior Healthcare Analyst   [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 It's very interesting.

I wondered if you could talk to us a little bit more about what you've learned regarding the inflammatory pathways associated with COVID.

And how your asset 195 -- excuse me, 109 can be effective there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes.

John, it's Alison.

So great question.

I think Kate covered it a little bit in her comments, but I'll ask her to comment some more.

Just to summarize, there is a number of pieces of evidence in preclinical models showing the link between the microbiome and short-chain fatty acid production.

And also, just to remind you, the short-chain fatty acid production is a result of fermentation of glycans in the gut and the link between this and different immune pathways in infections associated with viral respiratory infections.

So Kate, maybe you want to talk a little bit more about the evidence that we have, and then we can comment on KB109 characteristics.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Katharine Knobil,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Chief Medical Officer and Head of Research &amp; Development   [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes.

Thanks, Alison.

And thanks for your question.

We alluded to a lot of the data that we've been looking at recently, looking at the influence of short-chain fatty acids and short-chain fatty acids producing taxa in the gut in preclinical models and also in humans.

So just to reiterate, in preclinical models, we've seen that short-chain fatty acids or the taxa that produce them have had a positive impact on the pathology that occurred after influenza virus or RSV in preclinical models and actually has reduced the mortality associated with lethal influenza virus infection in mouse models.

It's -- we've also seen that high-fiber diet in these mouse models have reduced the pathology and the subsequent inflammatory reaction in the mice as well, as I mentioned earlier, the function of CD4 and CD8-positive T cell cells in macrophage function.

The inappropriate activation of these pathways can also cause increased neutrophil activity that can cause tissue damage, which has also been mitigated by short-chain fatty acids.

In humans, the data are really interesting in that in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplants who have been infected with these respiratory viruses, there's been a decrease in the progression of those infections to lower respiratory tract infections.

And I think that's really important because in these really vulnerable patient populations, we want to mitigate the activity and the [quality] of this inappropriate immune reaction that we've seen with COVID, and potentially improve the outcomes of these patients and decrease hospitalization.

So there's -- we find these data really compelling for the program.

And we're looking forward to seeing the results of the studies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 And John, just to add one more comment.

Just to remind you that KB109 is -- we've shown in our ex vivo screen that it increases the production of the ratio of short-chain fatty acids, as well as, of course, driving down the presence of pathogenic bacteria.

And so for that reason, we're very excited to have the opportunity to conduct this study, and look at how KB109 can really help the patient's whole own immune system to prevent the pathological implications with the COVID-19 infection.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Lawrence Newman,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Principal &amp; Senior Healthcare Analyst   [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay.

Great.

And then just had a question on the Phase II study for KB195.

Obviously, the entire industry has been affected by COVID-19 in terms of running clinical programs that's been difficult for everyone.

Just curious, with the 195 program, wondering when you might be able to activate some of the sites that you have set up, and just kind of curious as to how that might move forward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes, it's a great question, John.

And obviously, all clinical sites have been impacted by COVID-19.

And I think that the safety of patients is obviously the priority as far as not bringing patients into hospital and clinical sites where they could be at risk of acquiring the COVID-19 infection.

So as you can imagine, the enrollment of patients in our study has suffered as a result of that.

So we're working closely with the sites to make sure that as they start opening up, we can start to enroll the patients again.

I want to remind you that we actually have approval now across 10 different countries, and we have more than 20 sites where we're enrolling, and patients that will work closely with, as they say, as they start to get back on to some level of normality.

So right now, we are anticipating approximately a 6 months or more delay in the enrollment of that study.

But we'll be monitoring that closely as the sites get up and started again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Terence C. Flynn,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD   [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I was just wondering on KB109, if the current 2 trials could support a potential approval for the treatment of COVID or if additional trials would be required and then maybe you could outline the magnitude of the benefit across the various end points that you're hoping to show in terms of thinking about next steps and what you'd -- what would be an ideal profile for the drug?

And then any insight on total cost of the program?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay.

So I hear 3 questions in there, Terence, one on the potential approval.

So let me start there.

And what I would say is we are ready for a number of different possible routes forward, depending, really, on the clinical results that we see.

We do plan to have a pre-IND meeting with the FDA while these trials are ongoing, so that we have different options depending on the results.

I would say that could be anything, for example, from expanding the current clinical studies if we see some signals, but we decide we want to add more patients.

It could be working through and ensuring that an IND is filed ready to initiate the Phase III clinical study.

What I would also say is, given the safety profile of KB109, if we see signs that -- any signs that look like there's a benefit in these patients, it's a very important patient population to target and avoid these people from meeting to be hospitalized.

So we would be ready to work with the FDA at that point and with the potential of opening up an emergency use authorization.

So any one of those routes could be a possibility depending on the results that we see.

I'm going to hand over to Kate to talk a little bit about what results we're looking at as far as what we would anticipate being important trends.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Katharine Knobil,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Chief Medical Officer and Head of Research &amp; Development   [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes.

So we're measuring a number of endpoints in the study, from clinical end points, patient measured end points as well as biomarkers of the inflammatory response.

And so if we see a trend in the right direction in the clinical response, whether it be hospitalizations or even the percentage of patients showing low oxygen level, or if we see a mitigation of the inflammatory response, we would view this as very positive and very helpful for us to move forward with the rest of the program.

The other thing is that we will get data from this program, and that will also inform on the capability of KB109 working more broadly, not just in COVID-19, but potentially in other respiratory virus infections, as well as for the impact of MMTs on inflammatory diseases more broadly.

So that's what we're hoping to see.

And we hope to have these data very quickly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes.

And so coming back, and just to summarize again, Terence.

On the opportunity, if we see any benefit, obviously, there's a lot of discussion about is there going to be a second wave of the COVID-19?

What about other potential respiratory viral infections?

And certainly, if we see a benefit from this clinical study and things moving in the right direction, we will be ready and able to work with the FDA for that fastest route forward.

And that also ties in, I think, with your last question around costs because it links directly to manufacturing.

And just to remind you again that KB109, like all of our MMTs, it's a synthetic glycan and we actually use small molecule-like processing in our manufacturing.

So it's very easy to scale.

In fact, with KB195, sorry, our lead program, of course, we've already shown that we've been able to scale efficiently where we did that with our contract manufacturer, Thermo Fisher, in 6 months we scaled that production.

So we're confident we can scale manufacturing, and the costs are going to be right in line with kind of the small molecule typical pharmaceutical costs.

Mike, I don't know if you want to add any additional comment to that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Michael W. Bonney,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Executive Chair &amp; Office of Ceo   [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks, Alison.

And appreciate the question, Terence.

Look, as Kate mentioned in the prepared remarks, this is a controlled study, but it's also open label.

So we'll be able to monitor progress as this goes.

And that, I think, will provide a lot of clarity as we interact with both the FDA and make decisions around scaling up beyond this initial trial to have supply of 109 available.

So it's an appropriate rate of design from a patient safety standpoint, but it also affords us the opportunity to monitor what kind of response we're seeing.

And if it looks positive, that's just articulated on the clinical and/or the biomarkers of immune response, we'll be in a position then to work with our partners to start preproduction, if you will, before the final study data are available.

 Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Connor McGuinness Meehan,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Associate   [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This is Connor on for Matthew.

So just a couple from us.

You touched on them briefly, a couple of them.

But could you just comment on current enrollment status for the UCD trial?

And I guess, you mentioned that maybe you're likely pushing out enrollment by 6 months, but we were just wondering if you could provide any insight on how enrollment stands at present.

And then just on the COVID trial, is there any sort of margin of improvement that you'd be willing to guide on in terms of any of the end points you mentioned that you'd need to see to bring it forward?

And then just lastly, can you comment briefly on the profile or pretreatment status of the mild to moderate UC patients in the new KB295 study?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks, Carter.

I've got 3 parts, and I just want to clarify.

So the first question is around enrollment of UCD.

Let me address that first, and then I'll come back to your other 2 questions.

So in the enrollment in UCD, we're not providing details at this point of how many patients have been enrolled.

And we're guiding on 6 months -- that's what we're anticipating as far as the sites being able to come back online and start enrolling.

And of course, the patients that we have enrolled and we have data on so far, will be added to the pool of the additional patients that we plan to continue to enroll.

I do want to also just remind or mention again that we've expanded enrollment with an amendment to expand the age group so that we are confident, when we start that enrollment, it should go smoothly.

The second question I have, Carter, is around the margin of improvement in the different clinical symptoms.

And I think it's really difficult to say any single one that we would expect to see certain cutoffs as far as improvements.

I think that like many of these clinical studies, it's going to be looking across a broad range.

And as the FDA would say, looking at the totality of the evidence and seeing trends in the right direction for many of those different things, including, I think, importantly, the biomarkers of inflammation along with trends in some of the clinical signs and symptoms that we're going to be recording.

And then the third question I have, I'd actually ask you to repeat, please, Carter, because I heard you mentioned KB295 and UC.

But I wasn't completely clear on the question.

And I apologize, I just realized I've been calling you Carter instead of Connor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Connor McGuinness Meehan,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Associate   [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 No worries at all.

I get it more often than you might think.

So we were just wondering on the pretreatment status of patients that you plan to enroll in the UC 295 study?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay.

I'll ask Kate to comment on that one.

Thanks, Connor.

Got it right that time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Katharine Knobil,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Chief Medical Officer and Head of Research &amp; Development   [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 These are patients who are not yet on biologic therapy, so they can be 5-ASA or [in some mean] or ages like that, but not severe to require biologics.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Fye with JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Daniel G. Wolle,  JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Analyst   [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This is Daniel for Jessica Fye.

On the COVID-19 studies, can you elaborate -- can you walk us through the decision to evaluate clinical outcomes following 2 weeks of treatment?

What gives you the confidence that those 2 weeks of treatment is sufficient to translate into that clinical benefit?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes, sure.

Kate, do you want to comment on that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Katharine Knobil,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Chief Medical Officer and Head of Research &amp; Development   [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes.

So we, specifically, not only are looking at the 2 weeks of treatment but also 3 weeks of follow-up because we know that the course of COVID-19 can be several weeks.

What we wanted to do was to make sure that we treated patients during the more inflammatory phase of their disease.

And so we're going to be looking at those inflammatory markers, both after treatment and during the follow-up, and also looking at their recovery and whether or not they require extra care.

So I think 5 weeks is going to be enough for us to be able to see a difference.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 And I would also add that we know, with our MMTs, that we see a change in the microbiome -- the production of the microbiome metabolites of (inaudible) very quickly after starting dosing.

And so in that 2-week period, we would certainly anticipate seeing a change in the short-chain fatty acid profile that we're looking for to impact the immune system.

And the 2 weeks, of course, is what we also know about the course of the disease as far as that's a critical period from testing before patients may end up in the hospitals.

And so with the goal again of treating in that period, to avoid the consequences and avoid patients from going into the hospitals, which is where the real need is in the system, I think we have confidence that KB109 for that duration of treatment has the opportunity to show an effect.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Daniel G. Wolle,  JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Analyst   [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Got it.

On the KB174 program, with prior expectations for study starts in second half '20, which now seems to be contingent upon finding a partner, is it fair to say that you have already initiated partnership discussions?

And why now instead of waiting after getting more data?

And if you could elaborate, what type of partnerships are you looking for?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes.

So you were cut off just as you started that question, but I think it relates to KB174 and hepatic encephalopathy program.

So as you know, Daniel, we had very positive results in a clinical study that we reported at the -- I think it was in December now or early January, I forget, the time has gone by so quickly.

But that was in cirrhosis patients where we showed that we were able to reduce the production of ammonia by the microbiome, which was a very important study to show with KB174 as well as show the safety of it.

As a result, we had a number of parties interested in following up on discussions.

And we are, like, continuing those potential discussions with partners.

And at this point, we believe that, that's the best path forward.

I don't want to comment any further at this point around speculating what that may look like.

Mike, I think you may have a comment to add here as well?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Michael W. Bonney,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Executive Chair &amp; Office of Ceo   [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes.

Thank you, Alison.

I just wanted to raise -- remind everyone, that given the current crisis that we're in, this decision really is one of convenience, in that it is -- given our frameworks, a lot of uncertainty of what's going to happen with COVID-19 in the developed world, et cetera, right?

So we all acknowledge that there's uncertainty here.

It wouldn't be possible to enroll patients in this study currently that we have designed this next study simply in order to protect these patients with failing livers from undue exposure to COVID-19.

Given that, plus the interest that has attended to partnering this program subsequent to the delivery of the data in the cirrhotic patients that Alison identified, it just made sense to us to gate the start of this study, which we're very excited about on achieving this partnership, and that also will allow the -- hopefully, the health care system to start rebounding to the point where it's safe for patients with failing livers, who are otherwise not having acute illness, to come into a center and be -- started in the study and monitored appropriately and so forth.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Daniel G. Wolle,  JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Analyst   [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 All right.

And one more question.

On 295, one of the assessments was the impact on Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index.

Why not also look at the Mayo -- the live side of the Mayo score?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes.

Kate, would you like to comment on that for us?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Katharine Knobil,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Chief Medical Officer and Head of Research &amp; Development   [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes.

So there are a number of scores out there that we could use to simplify.

Activity score is actually well correlated with the Mayo score.

And so we feel confident that it will be a very good instrument for us to use in this study.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Our next question comes from the line of Gbola Amusa with Chardan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Samuel Lee;Chardan;Analyst,    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This is Sam Lee on behalf Gbola.

I have a couple of questions and a follow-up, and some of them actually have been answered a little bit already.

But number one, can you provide some color on the rationale behind the protocol amendments for 195, expanding the range from -- age range from 12 to 70 -- to 12 to 70, I'm sorry, from 18 to 65?

Is that COVID-19 related?

And two, for the Phase II UNLOCKED trial in KB195 in UCD, do you find that the COVID-19 pandemic is disrupting the collection and/or the quality of the endpoints in any way?

In other words, the fasting plasma ammonia and the 24-hour plasma ammonia and under the curve end points.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Okay.

Thanks for the question.

So first of all, let me start with your question around the age range for the protocol for the UNLOCKED study.

It has always been our intention to expand the age range.

As you probably know, a number of patients with UCDs involve and include children and adolescents and infants.

And so as we've collected sufficient data required, we've had the opportunity to submit the amendment and expand that age range.

So that was always our intention.

And it's just fortuitous, if you like, as far as timing, ready for enrolling that broader age group once we are able to start enrollment, again, at the clinical sites.

With regards to the collection of endpoint plasma ammonia, for example, as you can imagine, this is one of the issues with patients coming into sites and, really, collection of blood samples.

We've been doing a lot of work in looking at how we can do more remote monitoring and visits and collection of blood samples.

And so all of that has been part of our consideration in thinking about getting the study up and running again as soon as the sites can be started.

As you can imagine, in the COVID-19 environment and the clinical studies, there are many different options in looking at kind of nurses doing home visits instead of asking patients to come into sites, those types of things.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Samuel Lee;Chardan;Analyst,    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Right, of course.

I guess to follow up on that for these clinical programs.

In addition to that, what other measures are being taken to keep the trials running?

You mentioned maybe potentially nurse visits and such.

But would the patients still need to visit the sites at all?

And have there been any FDA discussions to adjust the trial design?

And if so, how so?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 So I'll maybe ask Kate to comment further on any adjustments to the study.

There have not been any discussions with the FDA to adjust the trial design other than the amendment that we have made to expand the age range for enrollment criteria.

But Kate, maybe you want to talk about some of the work that we've been doing to facilitate patients enrolling once we get up and started again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Katharine Knobil,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Chief Medical Officer and Head of Research &amp; Development   [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes.

And just to reiterate, to make this study as easy on patients as possible, we started out the study with as much remote visits -- as many remote visits as we could because we knew that, that could potentially be a burden.

And we're currently looking into ways to provide even more remote monitoring as we open up.

So we will be looking at whether or not there requires any further conversations with the FDA, but we know from guidance that these kinds of changes are well within the realm of things that we can do.

I just wanted to -- the other thing is that you asked a question about the quality of the end points that we're collecting.

There's been no impact on the quality of the endpoints that we've been measuring in this study due to COVID-19.

I just wanted to make that clear.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 And maybe I'll just make one more comment.

Again, because we have clinical sites across 10 different countries, we have the opportunity for different sites to start at different times as different countries is at different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Samuel Lee;Chardan;Analyst,    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Got it.

And one more final question.

In terms of the nonclinical programs, immuno-oncology and cardio-metabolic liver diseases, you did mention guidance that they should still be on track.

But I'm just wondering how you guys are facilitating the benchmark in terms of continuing it during the pandemic and how you're adjusting.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Yes.

No, it's a great question.

And we have worked very closely with the -- our partners, both at Gustave Roussy, who did close down for a little while in Paris.

And we know that they're planning to get up and started again.

We've been working very closely and coordinating with them and our other laboratories who've been doing this work.

We've also initiated some animal work at other sites, as China was coming back online much faster than some of the other countries.

We took the opportunity to make sure we had backup plans and animal work starting in China so that we could ensure we are on track here.

So I think with the understanding of where we are, working closely with our partners and contractors in the labs on this, as well as knowing that the good stuff we see matter are coming back online, we have confidence that we can deliver this data still in Q4 of this year.

This concludes today's question-and-answer section.

I would now like to turn the call back to Alison Lawton for closing remarks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thank you, and thanks for some great questions there and for joining us on the call this morning.

While the first quarter posed unexpected and unprecedented challenges for us as it did for most companies, I have to say I'm very proud of the team and their flexibility and dedication and commitment to our science as well as ensuring that our clinical trials and development programs have been able to continue to evolve.

And I'm particularly excited about this opportunity that we have to be part of the broader endeavor to better understand the cause of COVID-19, and how we might moderate the course of the disease with the goal of easing the burden on the health care system and the hospitals as well as, of course, potential future serious viral respiratory infections, more broadly.

So I'd like to conclude by thanking the patients and their families, our investigators and clinicians who've been involved in all of our clinical studies, as well as our great team here at Kaleido for making it all possible.

And have a great day, everybody.

Thank you.
