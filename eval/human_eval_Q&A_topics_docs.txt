Random Document-Topic Pairs for Q&A:

Document: This is Rich [Straysetter] in for Adam. Good job on the quarter. Just a question on gross margin. Obviously you did a great job in Q3 and you're attributing part of that product mix and operational efficiencies. Can you kind of break out the percentage? Is that the majority of operational efficiencies or product mix? And what would cause that to decline so much for your guidance for Q4?

Document: Okay on a different note. Looking at LTE, some of your products have shipped in equipment that can support more advanced 3G networks and can be software upgraded to 4G, is there any concern that some of the expectations for revenue growth based on LTE over the next couple of years may already essentially be that growth is already accounted for in equipment shipped today will just be largely have software upgrades over the next couple of years?

Document: Thanks for taking my question. Hey, Mike. quick question here on the IDTI business. You said it was running at a quarterly run rate of around $8 million, yet you're guiding $4.2 million for about two and a half months worth of sales. By my math, it seems like you should be guiding in the $6.5 million to $6.7 million. Any reason why the delta between what the quarterly run rate is and what you're guiding.

Document: This is J.J. Flores on behalf of Romit Shah. Ron, I have a question for you. I wanted to touch on your in waves into wireless infrastructure. I know you guys don't have any designs shipping right now but I was wondering if you guys are tied to any particular geography or wireless standard, whether it be GSM or CDMA, and also how are you thinking about this considering some earnings warnings from some of the big equipment guys and looks like slowing growth from North America and Western Europe for wireless.

Document: Okay, great. Now, if you look at the wireless world and the wireline world, the need for dedicated KPB versus integrated functionality in the main core, do you see any adoption curves, because you're still in the initial stages and the wireless world appears to have been an adopting dedicating KBP, so do you see that being integrated in the main core processor, and the adoption of KBP perhaps slower going forward in the wireless world, in comparison to wireline world?

Document: And one more question, if I can, Mike. What can we expect for I guess OpEx going forward in terms of growth?
Topic ID: -1 (Outlier)

Document: All right. And then one last question. It is seems like it has been a long time coming on the NETLite side. In NETL7 seems like we are seeing some adoption there. Mike, do you cross $10 million for the year in NETLite this year in NETL7, is that a next year event that you cross $10 million for the year?
Topic ID: -1 (Outlier)

Document: Okay. And then just one last question. You kind of commented on the prospects for your Japanese customer for this year. Can you maybe just give some color on Huawei and if that's going to be a flat type of revenue contribution until the end of the year as well?

Document: Is most of the market share gains from the one to two cores? It looks like that in favor of the higher core guys, like you guys and the Cavions of the world?
Topic ID: -1 (Outlier)

Document: Okay. Thanks. And then just one for Ron. In terms of the TAM, the TAM continues to expand. What's your the feeling on 2009, maybe 2010, in terms of what the TAM should grow at outside of looking at the macro near term?
Topic ID: -1 (Outlier)

Document: Got you. And could you just quickly give us an update where you guys are on total design wins for the company and how many of those are continually in volume production?
Topic ID: -1 (Outlier)

Document: Thanks, Mike. Maybe a question for Ron. Could you talk a little bit about sort of what time frame you expect your sort of Layer 4 through Layer 7 products, as well as kind of the NETLite families, so NETL7 and NETLite family what time frame do you see that showing some revenues and what the metrics are, is it by end market or customers that we can do to track that? Thank you.
Topic ID: -1 (Outlier)

Document: And then, what's on the platter in terms of design wins coming into production that could potentially drive growth ahead of some of these other product catalysts? Should we be thinking of fiscal '07 as somewhat of a transition year and really priming '08 as the big growth year?
Topic ID: -1 (Outlier)

Document: Perfect so with respect to Cisco we did see that bucket bounce back here sequentially in Q1. Any type of guidance as to what that customer could do for you guys going into Q2 time frame and have you seen ME? Has it just basically been lingering effects from the inventory situation at contract manufacturing that may have muted that bounce back in Q1?
Topic ID: -1 (Outlier)

Document: Okay, great. That's helpful. Also, since we are looking at the revenue trends the last few quarters, clearly we've had some issues. Trending flat, can you remind us how we should think of sort of normalized sequential growth, so we can properly model in the back half of the year? And do we get a pop in Q3, just based on perhaps maybe a little bit of overshoot or working down inventory, and needing to get back to our normalized levels?
Topic ID: -1 (Outlier)

Document: And going into the first half of next year it sounds like it's going to be mostly the core business that's going to have to try to hold up or drive growth. Do you have any visibility there as to meaningful design wins ramping in the first half of the year to support any type of growth?
Topic ID: -1 (Outlier)

Document: Thank you very much. A couple of other questions. First, if you look at clearly, you know, there's a lot of companies that talked about invetory correction. You're not the only company. If you can talk about is there a geographic difference, for example? Are you seeing differences from your major customer contract manufacturers versus Japan? Are you at a point where you would likely see a Japan recover or do you think Q1 is likely to continue from those two end markets? Thanks.
Topic ID: -1 (Outlier)

Document: And I guess from a total available market point of view, do you see this as doubling your enterprise opportunities? Or is it higher than that?
Topic ID: -1 (Outlier)

Document: OK, and then can you just give a little more color on Greenfield and just what's going on, what happened there and just what gives you confidence that you'll see NETLite and NET7 revenue of 5 million next year?
Topic ID: -1 (Outlier)

Document: Got you, and then as you look at Cisco, Ron, you went through that really quickly. You've also talked about having 21 new programs ramping, three of which would have ramped, including one in the June quarter. Can you update us on that number, and then just go back over quickly the business that you talked about that's going to shift in the September quarter? You went through that pretty quickly.
Topic ID: -1 (Outlier)

Document: Coming back to the XLT product. This would be more of a 2012 revenue generating processor from kind of a material driven generating process or is this going to be more of a second half 2011? You did talk about getting sample wins, but when can we see this materially contributing, 5% to 10% of the year?
Topic ID: -1 (Outlier)

Document: Got you. Talked about strength in April, was that mostly Cisco driven in terms of replenishment of the inventory drain you saw in Q1, or was it across the board, broad based?
