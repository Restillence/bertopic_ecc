  Good morning, ladies and gentleman, and welcome to the Neuronetics Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Results Conference Call.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Klausner from Westwicke Partners.

Sir, you may begin.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mark R. Klausner,  Westwicke Partners, LLC - Managing Partner   [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Neuronetics' Third Quarter 2018 Conference Call.

A replay of this call will be available on our website for 30 days.

Joining me on today's call are Neuronetics' Chief Executive Officer, Chris Thatcher; and its Chief Financial Officer, Peter Donato.

Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements governed by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements relating to our business strategy, financial and revenue guidance and other operational items and metrics.

Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business.

For a discussion of risks and uncertainties associated with Neuronetics' business, I encourage you to review the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's final prospectus relating to its initial public offering, and the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q that will be filed today.

The company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the course of this call, except as required by law.

During the call, we will also present certain financial information on a non-GAAP basis, including EBITDA.

Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures taken in conjunction with U.S. GAAP financial measures provide useful information for both management and investors by excluding certain noncash and other expenses that are not indicative of our core operating results.

Management uses non-GAAP measures to compare our performance relative to forecasts and strategic plans to benchmark our performance externally against competitors, and for certain compensation decisions.

Reconciliations between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results are presented in tables accompanying our earnings release.

Reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the approximate GAAP measures is provided in the company's press release for the quarter, which can be viewed on our website.

With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Neuronetics' Chief Executive Officer, Chris Thatcher.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call.

I'll start by providing an update on our performance during the third quarter followed by an update on the progress we've made towards our key priorities.

I will then hand the call over to Peter, who will walk through our financial performance and guidance, after which, we will open the line up to take your questions.

The third quarter was very strong, with worldwide revenue growing by 31% over the prior year, and U.S. revenue growing by 30%.

Our performance continues to validate the commercial strategy that we have developed and put into place, our ability to execute in a competitive market, and most importantly, the promise of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy's clinical outcomes for patients, which offers a viable alternative for psychiatrists serving their patients with treatment-resistant depression.

As we've mentioned on our first call as a public company in August, we have 3 strategic priorities, as we seek to drive growth in our business.

As a reminder, the first one is to continue to drive the adoption of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in the U.S. through the expansion of our sales force and the implementation of marketing initiatives.

Second, increasing reoccurring treatment session revenue by improving active system utilization by penetrating high-volume single and group practices.

And third, make progress towards obtaining reimbursement approval and expanding commercialization in Japan.

I would now like to provide an update on the progress we've made on each of these priorities.

During the third quarter, we continued to expand our sales force.

Our goal for 2018 was to add an incremental 15 BDM territories adding to the 29 BDM territories we had at the start of the year.

As a reminder, BDM or Business Development Managers are focused on capital sales.

During the first half of the year, we filled 10 of those 15 BDM territories, all of which were active by the end of the second quarter.

In the third quarter, we filled 4 of the remaining 5 territories, slightly ahead of plan.

And I'm pleased to report that each of those 4 territories are fully trained and active.

The plan is to fill the final position in Q4, and with a total of 44 BDM territories at the end of the fourth quarter and going into 2019, we believe we can continue to grow growth in the active installed base into the future.

We anticipate the continued expansion of our BDM territories in 2019.

We're very excited with the quality of the salespeople we've been able to attract, and we believe it speaks to the significant market opportunity for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy.

We have developed a proven sales strategy as demonstrated by consistent growth, both as a private and a public company.

However, I felt we could and can do better.

To help drive our ongoing commercial execution, we created a Chief Commercial Officer role in the second quarter to manage our larger and expanding sales and marketing teams, and manage the day-to-day commercial operations.

This role oversees approximately 130 people across a variety of functions, including sales, marketing, reimbursement and customer support.

Shifting gears to our marketing initiatives.

As we mentioned on our last call, during the second quarter, we launched a national TV advertising campaign aimed at raising patient awareness that NeuroStar Advanced Therapy can treat major depressive disorder, should anti-depression medications not work for them.

All of our website metrics were up significantly, immediately following the launch of the TV ads, and we believe that at least some of the uptick in treatment session revenue during the middle part of the year was due to the TV ads.

In addition to driving sales, another goal of these ads were to further develop the NeuroStar brand and increase the awareness of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy among major depressive disorder patients, their families and friends, as well as psychiatrists and physicians.

Based on the success of the initial TV ads, we have decided to launch another round of TV ads during the [first] quarter, in order to continue to increase treatment session revenue and brand awareness.

As some of you may know, October was Depression Awareness Month.

In conjunction with our ongoing marketing efforts, we launched additional PR, online interviews and televised satellite tour designed to increase national awareness and to educate the public on NeuroStar Advanced Therapy as an innovative depression treatment option, while sparking a much-needed dialogue on breaking the stigma associated with mental health.

The satellite tour was picked up by tens of TV stations across the country.

During October, the company hit a milestone as the 2 millionth NeuroStar Advanced Therapy treatment session was delivered.

It is incredibly rewarding to be part of a company that has transformed so many lives and continues to do so every day.

We remain focused on providing hope to those who need it most, and make sure as many people as possible know about this proven treatment, not just during national Depression Awareness Month, but throughout the year.

Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, the company attended the 31st Annual U.S. Psychiatric and Mental Health Congress, more commonly known as the Psych Congress held in Orlando.

While at the Congress, we hosted a context-sensing challenge, which allowed attendees to witness how easy it can be for a TMS System to lose contact with a patient during a treatment session, especially when the system lacks the ability to monitor a patient's positioning.

The smallest movement by the patient during treatment can result in a dramatic loss in the prescribed treatment dose.

Even a 1-millimeter movement of the head away from the coil can result in a 40% loss of the prescribed treatment dose.

Our patented continuous contact sensing solves this problem.

NeuroStar is the only TMS System in the market that provides contact sensing technology, to deliver the right dose to the right location every time to treat depression and maximize a patient's chance of achieving remission.

We believe that this allows for precise and reproducible treatments for each and every patient.

This is just one example of how we have developed our market-leading position.

Turning to our initiatives to drive reoccurring treatment session revenue.

On our last call, we discussed our strategy to introduce and integrate the CTC or the Clinical Training Consultant.

During the second quarter, we hit our 2018 target of hiring and training 9 CTCs.

The CTC position was created to allow the CPC or the Clinical Practice Consultant to focus on driving pull-through rather than spending time training and onboarding new practices.

While we are seeing accelerating revenues or volume increases for treatment sessions, it's too early to disaggregate and attribute that increase directly to this initiative.

However, there has clearly been a positive improvement to utilization.

So we're encouraged that the combination of all of our strategies, the BDM expansion, the CTC integration, high-volume, target account focus and market efforts -- marketing efforts are driving growth in the business, and have set the stage to continue our success in the fourth quarter and into 2019.

As Peter will discuss in more detail, we have seen a significant uptick in treatment session volume year-over-year.

This is being driven both by the increase in the active installed base, and an increase in the utilization per system.

Much of this increase is due to the execution of our HVT strategy, as we see these practices performing at higher volumes.

This speaks to the market demand for our therapy and the ability of motivated providers to attract patients.

As it relates to our product pipeline, we had a successful launch of our next-generation TrakStar practice management system during the second quarter.

Early feedback has been very positive, as practitioners have commented on the fact that they really like the cloud-based data management system, because they are able to better monitor system usage real-time across their existing offices along with employee usage of the system in order to increase efficiency across their network.

Lastly, we continue to make good progress towards achieving reimbursement in Japan by the end of 2018.

During the second quarter, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare or MHLW accepted our submission for reimbursement.

Since that time we have had very positive interactions with MHLW.

We currently expect that our reimbursement code will be decided in the December of 2018, and published in March of 2019, at which point, we can commence commercial efforts.

In advance of the anticipated decision on reimbursement, our partner in Japan, Teijin Pharmaceuticals has been working diligently on market development efforts to be prepared to launch.

In order to do so, they have focused on sales rep training, physician training, and the establishment of key reference sites.

Teijin has made a significant investment in sales force education in order to have 100% of their reps fully trained on selling NeuroStar Advanced Therapy.

They've also been very proactive in getting physicians trained, both on the science of TMS in general as well as the benefits of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy.

Year-to-date, 150 providers have gone through the general science training on TMS and about half have now completed NeuroStar Advanced Therapy training, and the remainder are on track to be completed by year-end.

These trainings have been very well attended, and there continues to be high demand for future events with an upcoming January 2019 TMS training session already fully booked with 150 physicians.

Teijin's free commercialization activities are well on their way.

They're establishing key sites throughout Japan to allow as many prospective accounts as possible to interact with the NeuroStar system and speak with KOLs on the treatment.

We will continue to provide updates on our progress in Japan, as key milestones are achieved.

I would now like to turn the call over to Peter for a financial review.

Peter?

  Thanks, Chris.

Total revenue for the quarter was $13.7 million, a 31% increase over the prior year quarter.

U.S. revenue was $13.5 million, an increase of 30% over the third quarter of 2017.

OUS revenue was approximately $220,000, an increase of 135% versus the prior year period.

The increase in OUS revenue was primarily a function of milestone payments as well as a small number of treatment session sales to our Japanese distributor.

You should be aware that the milestone payments in Japan of $2.75 million collected to date are being amortized over the life of the contract.

U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenue was $3.9 million during the third quarter, a 38% increase over the prior year.

As a reminder, NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenue primarily consists of revenue from capital sales, but also includes revenue from coils, rentals and upgrades.

Capital revenue grew 58% driven by higher volume during the period as a result of our ongoing sales force expansion and marketing initiatives.

In addition, we saw a 1% increase in average selling price as compared to the prior year period.

These positive trends were partially offset by lower upgrade, rentals and other related revenue in the quarter.

During the quarter, we saw our active installed-base increase to 858 units, a net increase of 42 units from June 30, 2018, and an increase of 133 units from September 30, 2017.

Keep in mind, we define an active unit as a NeuroStar unit that was either purchased or rented during the quarter or one which has ordered NeuroStar treatment sessions during the last 12 months.

U.S.

Treatment session revenue was $9.2 million for the third quarter of 2018, an increase of 28% over the prior year quarter.

The increase was primarily due to an approximate 31% increase in treatment sessions purchased, plus a 3% increase in other treatment session revenue.

This was partially offset by an approximate 6% decline in treatment session ASPs.

This pricing decline was slightly higher than our expectations due to the success of our HVT strategy, which has resulted in higher realization of volume pricing discounts that we provide to customers, who perform a significant number of procedures as Chris talked about earlier.

U.S. service and other revenue was approximately $400,000, a 15% increase as a result of our expanded active installed base.

Gross profit for the third quarter of 2018 was $10.7 million, an increase of $2.8 million from $7.9 million during the third quarter of 2017.

Gross margin for the third quarter of 2018 was 77.9%, which was higher than the third quarter of 2017 gross margin of 74.9%.

The improvement in gross margin was driven by increased leverage on our field service and operations cost as a result of higher year-over-year total revenues, which were slightly offset by lower international NeuroStar sales.

While we are starting to see operating leverage and expect to see a benefit from that in the future, we do not expect to see such a significant year-over-year uptick going forward.

As a reminder, we continue to drive gross margins toward the mid-70% range for 2018.

Sales and marketing expenses for the third quarter of 2018 were $9.7 million, an increase of $3.1 million over the prior year period.

The increase was primarily due to costs associated with the expansion of our sales force, as well as additional marketing efforts.

General administrative expenses were $3.2 million, an increase of about $1 million compared to the prior year.

The increase was primarily driven by higher expenses as a result of being a public company.

Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2018 were $2.1 million, an increase of approximately $300,000 from the prior year period.

The increase was primarily due to continued investment in advanced development projects, partially offset by lower spending on clinical studies.

Net loss for the third quarter was $5 million, compared to a net loss of $3.8 million in the third quarter of 2017.

EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure for the third quarter of 2018 was a loss of $3.8 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $2.8 million in the third quarter of 2017, for all the reasons cited previously.

Moving to the balance sheet.

We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $106.8 million compared to $14.5 million at June 30, 2018 and $29.1 million at year-end 2017.

Cash usage during the quarter was in line with our expectations.

As a reminder, on July 2, 2018, we closed our IPO in which we issued and sold 6.325 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $17 per share.

We received net proceeds of $96.5 million after deducting all operating expenses, which given the timing of our offering was not reflected in our GAAP reported cash number at the end of Q2.

Turning to guidance.

For the full year 2018, we now expect total worldwide revenue of between $51 million and $52.5 million, representing growth in the range of 26% to 30% over the prior year.

This is an increase over our previous guidance range of $50 million to $51.5 million.

I will now hand the call back over to Chris.

  Thank you, Peter.

We had very strong third quarter.

We were able to grow revenue by 31%, as we continue to sell more NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems, while at the same time driving greater pull-through within these placements.

This exceptional growth has come as a result of focused efforts on the long-term commercial strategy that we put in place, in combination with the development of our industry-leading TMS technology for the treatment of drug resistant-depression.

We're very excited about the future at Neuronetics.

Looking at the remainder of 2018 and 2019, we will continue to work diligently to bring NeuroStar Advanced Therapy to an even greater number of psychiatrists and their patients.

With that, I'd like to open the line for questions.

  Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call.

I'll start by providing an update on our performance during the fourth quarter and the full year 2018, followed by an update on the progress we made towards our key priorities.

I'll then hand the call over to Peter to walk through our financial performance and guidance for Q1 and 2019, after which we will discuss our priorities for 2019 before opening up the line to take your questions.

Overall, the fourth quarter was very strong as we continued to drive the adoption of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy.

Total revenue was $15.6 million, an increase of 29% over the prior year, largely driven by 37% growth in U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy revenue and 23% growth in U.S. treatment session revenue.

For the full year of 2018, total revenue was $52.8 million, an increase of 31% over the prior year.

We are proud of what we've been able to accomplish in 2018.

Our performance demonstrates our ability to execute on our strategy to drive the adoption of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy and maintain our market leadership position.

We've continued to see strong growth in a number of psychiatric practices utilizing our therapy, which, we believe, is driven by our ability to offer a clinically proven therapy that is both user- and patient-friendly, while at the same time providing world-class training, practice support and service.

Shifting gears to an update on our operating performance.

As we outlined last year, we have three strategic priorities as we seek to drive growth in the business: As a reminder, the first was to continue to drive the adoption of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in the U.S. through the expansion of our sales force and the implementation of marketing initiatives.

Second, increase recurrent treatment session revenue by improving active system utilization by penetrating high-volume single group practice.

And third, make progress towards obtaining reimbursement approval and commercialization in Japan.

So taking each of these in order.

During the fourth quarter, we continued to expand our sales force.

Our goal for 2018 was to add an incremental 15 BDM territories on top of the 29 BDM territories which were active at the beginning of 2018.

As a reminder, the BDMs are Business Development Managers who are focused on driving capital sales.

Through the first 3 quarters of the year, we filled 14 of the 15 BDM territories, and we filled the last BDM territory in the fourth quarter, bringing our total to 44 at the end of the year.

We're very pleased with how these recently hired reps have been able to get up to speed with their hiring and productivity being slightly ahead of our internal modeling.

During the fourth quarter, we continued to utilize TV advertising campaigns to help increase patient awareness of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy and ultimately drive increased utilization.

We ran our second national DTC campaign of the year in October and November.

Leveraging the learnings from our initial campaign, we optimized our strategy to more effectively target potential patients.

We saw strong lifts in many key return metrics, including website traffic and lead generation, which is characterized as position locator usage, click-to-call usage and appointments generated, which we're very pleased with.

While we view this as a very successful campaign, we did learn that there is an opportunity to improve our customers' conversion rates or converting an interested patient into an active patient.

What we learned is that in order to convert a patient, the psychiatric office must respond within a very narrow window of time, following the potential patient's initial outreach, after which, conversion metrics declined significantly.

As we look into the future marketing campaigns, we will work with our customers to help take advantage of this opportunity.

Part of our strategy to drive and improve system utilization was the addition of the CTC, or Clinical Training Consultant, in 2019.

We hired 9 CTCs in the first half of 2018 to help more quickly onboard new accounts and allow for the CPC to focus on working with psychiatrists and practices to successfully treat patients and drive increased utilization.

Given our recent BDM expansion, we felt the CTC addition will be critical in order to keep up with the new customer training.

In the second half of the year, we were able to see an overall improvement and pull-through as systems were able to begin treating patients more quickly at a higher rate than in previous years.

I'm very proud of the commercial organization that we have been able to build over the last few years and specifically, the progress we made in 2018.

We've developed and grown a highly sophisticated, deeply integrated commercial infrastructure which encompasses sales, marketing, reimbursement and customer support.

I look forward to leveraging what we built to continue to drive adoption for years to come.

Moving to Japan.

As we announced in January, we believe a decision on reimbursement will occur in the second half of 2019 and remain enthusiastic on the opportunity to bring our product to a country that would so greatly benefit.

This shift in timeline came as a result of discussions we had with the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare during the fourth quarter.

The shift was largely driven by routine trade-off decisions involving reimbursement rates and the breadth of provider access.

In anticipation of the reimbursement decision, we have continued to work with our partner in Japan, Teijin Pharmaceuticals, on market development efforts ahead of an official launch.

Teijin remains a committed partner.

They've invested millions of dollars to establish and develop a fully dedicated division within the company focused on the eventual commercial launch in NeuroStar Advanced Therapy throughout Japan.

I would now like to turn the call over to Peter to review our financial results.

  Thanks, Chris.

Total revenue for the quarter was $15.6 million, a 29% increase over the prior year quarter.

U.S. revenue was $15.1 million, an increase of 27% over the fourth quarter of 2017.

OUS revenue was approximately $550,000, an increase of 101% versus the prior year period.

The increase in OUS revenue was primarily a function of NeuroStar system sales in Japan as well as the ongoing amortization of milestone payments from our Japanese partner.

U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue was $4.8 million during the fourth quarter, a 37% increase over the prior year.

As a reminder, NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue primarily consists of revenue from capital sales, but also includes revenue from system upgrades to allow our NeuroStar systems to perform 19-minute treatment sessions.

Capital sales revenue grew 46%, driven by higher unit sales volume during the period as a result of our ongoing sales force expansion and continued marketing initiatives.

This was partially offset by a 4% decrease in average selling price as compared to the prior year period.

The positive trends in capital sales volume and revenue were partially offset by lower upgrades for the 19-minute treatment session in 2018 versus 2017.

During the quarter, we saw our active installed base increase to 907 units, a net increase of 49 units from the third quarter of 2018 and an increase of 155 units from year-end 2017.

Keep in mind, we define an active unit as a NeuroStar unit that was placed in service during the quarter or one that ordered treatment sessions during the last 12 months.

U.S. treatment sessions revenue's was $9.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter.

The increase was primarily due to an approximate 26% increase in treatment sessions purchased as well as a 3% increase in other treatment session revenue.

This was partially offset by just under a 6% decline in treatment session ASPs due to predetermined volume pricing discounts within our existing customer base, which are triggered when those customers surpass certain predefined high-volume thresholds.

U.S. service and other revenue was approximately $400,000, a 21% increase as a result of our expanded installed base.

Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $11.9 million, an increase of $2.8 million from $9.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2017.

Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 76.3%, which was higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 gross margin of 75.6%.

The improvement in gross margin was driven by increased leverage on our service and operations areas.

Sales and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2018 were $10.6 million, an increase of $2 million over the prior year.

The increase was primarily due to the increased size of our sales force and the spending on our marketing campaigns.

General and administrative expenses were $4.7 million, an increase of about $1.9 million compared to the prior year.

The increase was primarily driven by increased costs related to being a public company.

Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2018 were $2.2 million, an increase of approximately $300,000 from the prior year period.

The increase was primarily due to higher personnel and product development costs related to the commencement of our next-generation platform design.

Net loss for the fourth quarter was $6.1 million compared to a net loss of $4.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.

EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, for the fourth quarter of 2018 was a loss of $5 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Moving to the balance sheet.

We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $104.6 million compared to $106.8 million at the end of the third quarter of 2018 and $29.1 million at year-end 2017.

Cash usage during the quarter was in line with our expectations.

Turning to guidance.

For the full year 2019, we expect total worldwide revenue of between $62.5 million and $64.5 million, representing approximately 18% and 22% year-over-year growth, respectively.

For the full year 2019, we expect gross margins to be in the mid-70s range, in line with full year 2018 margins and previous guidance.

For the full year of 2019, we expect operating expenses to be between $71.5 million and $76.5 million, primarily due to continued investment in our sales force expansion efforts, research and development related to the development of our next-generation NeuroStar platform and clinical spending as we pursue additional indications for use, namely PTSD and Bi-Polar disorders.

For the first quarter of 2019, we expect total worldwide revenue of between $12.4 million and $13 million, representing 22% and 28% year-over-year growth, respectively.

I'll now turn the call back over to Chris.

Chris?

 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [5]

  Thanks, Peter.

As we look to 2019, our primary focus is driving the continued adoption of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy and bringing relief to the greatest number of patients possible.

I'm pleased to note that our year is off to a good start.

In particular, at the recent CTMS and Brain Stimulation Conference, we saw significant booth traffic which led to strong lead generation.

As we continue to drive growth in 2019, our strategic priorities are as follows: First, continue the expansion of our sales force and related marketing efforts; second, continue the focus on driving long-term increases in system utilization; third, the continuing development of our next-generation NeuroStar system; fourth, beginning the clinical work to set the stage for the expansion into new indications; and lastly, launch NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in Japan and selectively evaluate entry into other international markets.

Taking each of these in order, beginning with the continued expansion of our sales force and related marketing efforts.

In 2019, our goal is to add an incremental 15 BDM territories, bringing our total to 59 by the end of the year.

We continue to be very excited about the quality of the salespeople we're able to attract, and we feel very confident that we can continue to drive predictable growth in new system sales and subsequent pull-through as a result.

In addition to the expansion of our sales force, we will continue to utilize DTC marketing campaigns throughout the year.

We launched multiple campaigns during 2018, each of which allowed us to drive greater insight into the most effective ways to turn a viewer of a television ad into a patient undergoing treatment for MDD with NeuroStar Advanced Therapy.

We believe that further investments will pay dividends in the form of increased patient awareness, lead generation, system sales and, ultimately, system utilization.

We plan to continue to test and retest the DTC campaign in 2019.

We will provide periodic updates on the details around the campaign throughout the year.

Moving on to driving long-term increases in system utilization.

In line with our BDM expansion and recent new system installation growth, we're also going to be adding both CPCs and CTCs throughout the year.

Part of our value proposition to psychiatrists is being be able to help onboard, train and grow our practices' use of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy.

We plan -- our plan is to add an incremental 5 CPCs and 6 CTCs during the year, bringing the total number of CPCs to 33 and the total number of CTCs to 15 by the end of the year.

Another of our strategic priorities is the development and future launch of our next-generation NeuroStar system.

We are in the beginning of a multiyear process to create the next-generation NeuroStar system.

As good as the system is today in meeting patients' or providers' needs, we feel it could be even better.

As we prepare for the natural replacement cycle for NeuroStar systems, we're committed to maintaining our industry leadership position by continually advancing the capabilities of our system for use in both clinical and research settings.

On the clinical front, we're building out our clinical science team in advance of planned discussions later this year with the FDA on clinical trials for PTSD and Bi-Polar.

We believe that both of these indications represent large and underserved market opportunities that are complementary to our existing call points.

Based on our initial exploration, we believe that the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system may be an effective treatment for patients suffering from these conditions.

Our last strategic priority is prudently expanding our global footprint.

It's estimated that there are over 300 million MDD patients globally, the significant majority of which reside outside the U.S.

While our near-term focus is in Japan, we are planning to explore additional commercial expansions very selectively in Europe, in Asia in the second half of this year.

We expect to receive a reimbursement decision in Japan in the second half of 2019, and we'll continue to work with our partner in Japan to be ready to launch quickly after the decision is finalized.

As a reminder, there are currently no commercial revenues from Japan included in our guidance.

We're very excited about the future of Neuronetics and look forward to updating you on our progress in future quarters.

And with that, I'd like now to open up the line for questions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call.

I'll start by providing an update on our performance during the first quarter followed by an update in the progress we made towards our key priorities.

I'll then hand the call over to Peter to walk through our financial performance and guidance for Q2 and 2019.

After which, we will provide our closing remarks before opening up the line to take the questions.

The first quarter was a good start to the year as we continue to drive the adoption of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy.

Total revenue was $12.7 million, an increase of 25% over the prior year; primarily driven by 41% growth in the U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy revenue and 21% growth in U.S. treatment session revenue.

Our growth continues to validate our strategy, our ability to execute and NeuroStar Advanced Therapy's proven clinical outcomes for patients, which offers a viable alternative for psychiatrists serving their patients with treatment resistant depression.

On our fourth quarter call, we laid out our focus for the year which was to drive the adoption of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy.

In order to do so, we provided a list of our strategic priorities for 2019.

As a reminder, these priorities are to continue the expansion of our sales force and marketing efforts, focus on driving long-term increases in system utilization, development of our next generation NeuroStar system, begin the clinical work to set the stage for the expansion of new indications and launch NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in Japan and selectively evaluate and treat into other international markets.

Taking each of these in order, as we look to continue the expansion of our sales force and related marketing efforts in 2019, our goal is to add an incremental 15 BDM territories bringing our total to 59 by the end of the year.

In the first quarter, we filled four of those territories, all of which are all fully trained and active.

We continue to be very excited about the quality of the salespeople we're able to attract and we feel very confident that we can continue to drive predictable growth in new system sales and subsequent treatment session pull-through as a result.

In addition to the expansion of our sales force, we continued to utilized DTC marketing campaigns.

In 2018, we launched multiple campaigns at turning a viewer of a television ad into a patient undergoing treatment with NeuroStar Advanced Therapy.

Each of these campaigns provided greater insight into the most effective way to increase patient awareness, generate leads for the practice and ultimately drive system utilization.

In our most recently completed campaign, we gained further insight into campaign frequency, ad duration and the importance of the speed of practice follow-up.

Leveraging those learnings and with a focus on effectively managing the patients-psychiatrist touch point, we launched a nationwide TV ad campaign at the end of the first quarter.

The results we have seen so far have been excellent with significant increases in Web traffic, appointment requests and patient conversions which improved the overall cost per patient conversion.

At this stage, we know that we have optimized our marketing spend to get a patient to contact a psychiatrist.

We're optimistic that with each iteration we will continue to create increased demand at the more efficient rate and improve our ability to convert patients who respond to the TV campaign.

Our second strategic priority for the year is to drive long-term utilization increases.

As we have noted previously, we will continue to increase the number of CPC's, or clinical practice consultants, and CTC's, or clinical training consultants in order to maximize the utility of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy for our customers and patients.

Our goal for 2019 is to add an incremental five CPC's and an additional six CTC's to keep up with new system sales and optimize the CPC's territories based on the uneven distribution of system sales in 2018.

During the first quarter, we hired all five of the CPC's and five of the six CTC's slightly ahead of our expectations for the year.

Another one of our strategic priorities is the development and future launch of our next generation NeuroStar system.

We're in the early stages of a multi-year process to create the next iteration of NeuroStar system.

During the first quarter, we continue to drive towards that goal as we look to maintain our industry leadership position by continuingly advancing the capabilities of our system from use in both clinical and research settings.

This initiative starts with our voice of customer and fundamental research and I'm pleased to share that we've completed that and we've begun our product development process.

Our fourth strategic priority for 2019 is to begin the clinical work to set the stage for expansion of indications for use for the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system.

Our current focus is the build-out of our clinical science team and advance of planned discussions later this year with the FDA on clinical trials on PTSD and bipolar.

This team is building out nicely and I'm pleased with the talent we're brining into this function.

Our final strategic priority for the year is the prudent expansion of our global footprint.

Our near-term focus is on the commercial launch in Japan.

As announced in March, Japan's Central Social Insurance Medial Council has approved the recommendation by Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare to provide reimbursement for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy.

The reimbursement is expected to go into effect on or about June 1, 2019.

Obtaining reimbursement approval in Japan, a single-payer health care system, is a critical milestone that facilitates psychiatrists and facilities implementing NeuroStar Advanced Therapy into their treatment continuum to provide a much needed and affordable treatment alternative for MDD patients.

The initial reimbursement approval for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy is expected to cover patients treated at approximately 160 of the largest in-patient and outpatient psychiatric facilities with the most comprehensive mental health services in Japan.

The reimbursement rate at these facilities will be 12,000 Japanese yen per session.

Initially, Teijin Pharmaceuticals, our distribution partner, will have the ability to market to the largest in-patient and out-patient centers in Japan which aligns with our market segmentation and go-to-market strategy.

As of today, approximately 38 doctors from the qualifying facilities have been trained.

As part of the product approval process, a physician needs to be trained by both the [JSPN] and by Teijin.

While the level of reimbursement didn't come in lower than the U.S., we're comfortable that this level supports commercializing the product in Japan.

I would note, that there is a process for us to collect clinical and economic data in a Japanese market subsequent to the launch that we will utilize over the next few years to try to potentially increase both the level of reimbursement as well as increase the number of facilities Teijin can sell to.

While we remain enthusiastic about the Japanese market, we do not anticipate material revenue in 2019 but anticipate that revenue will grow in 2020 and beyond as Teijin sales and marketing efforts mature.

Overall, we're very excited about the progress we made in the first quarter and our ability to continue to drive strong top-line growth in the business and maintain our market leadership position.

I would now like to hand the call over to Peter to discuss our financial performance.

  Thanks, Chris.

Total revenue for the quarter was $12.7 million, a 25% increase over the prior year quarter.

U.S. revenue was $12.5 million, an increase of 26% over the first quarter of 2018.

Outside the U.S. revenue was approximately $182,000, an increase of 1% versus the prior year period.

U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue for the first quarter of 2019 was $3.4 million, an increase of 41% over the first quarter 2018 revenue of $2.4 million.

The increase in U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue was primarily driven by higher capital in rent-to-own revenue.

Capital units increased by 42% while average selling prices declined by 8% as compared to last year.

On a sequential quarterly basis, average selling prices for capital sales were up approximately one-half of one point.

During the quarter, we saw our active install base increase to 931 units, a net increase of 150 units from the first quarter of 2018; and an increase of 24 units from year-end 2018.

Please note that we had an atypical number of systems go inactive during the first quarter related to a single large customer who had to return a group of their systems and these were pulled out of the active installed base.

U.S. treatment session revenue was $8.8 million for the first quarter of 2019, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter.

The increase was primarily due to an approximate 18% increase in treatment sessions purchased as well as an increase in other treatment session revenue.

This was partially offset by a 3% decline in treatment session ASP's, due to predetermined volume pricing discounts within our existing customer base.

This is in line with expectations and these discounts are triggered when customers surpass certain predefined high volume thresholds.

U.S. service and other revenue was approximately $418,000, a 16% increase as a result of our expanded install base.

Gross profit for the first quarter of 2019 was $9.9 million, an increase of $2.2 million from $7.7 million during the first quarter of 2018.

Gross margin for the first quarter of 2019 was 77.9%, which was higher than the first quarter of 2018 gross margin of 75.8%.

The majority of the increase in gross margin was the result of increased leverage on our service and operations cost as a result of higher sales compared to the prior year period.

Sales and marketing expenses for the first quarter of 2019 were $9.6 million, an increase of a million and a half dollars over the prior year.

The increase was primarily due to the increased size of our sales force spending on our marketing campaigns in support of a larger install base.

General administrative expenses were $4.6 million, an increase of about $2 million compared to the prior year.

The increase was primarily driven by increased cost related to being a public company as well as legal and tax charges.

Research and development expenses for the first quarter of 2019 were $2.8 million, an increase of approximately $1.2 million from the prior year period.

The increase was primarily due to higher personnel and product development costs related to the commencement of our next generation platform.

Net loss for the first quarter was $7.5 million, compared to a net loss of $5.5 million in the first quarter of 2018.

EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure for the first quarter of 2019, was a loss of $6.4 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2018.

Moving to the balance sheet.

We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalence of $96.1 million, compared to $104.6 million at year-end 2018.

Cash usage during the quarter was in line with our expectations.

Turning to guidance, for the full year 2019, we are reiterating our guidance of total worldwide revenue of between $62.5 million and $64.5 million, representing approximately 18% and 22% year-over-year growth respectively.

For the full year 2019, we continue to expect gross margins to be in the mid 70's range, in line with full-year 2018 margins in our previous guidance.

For the full year 2019, we continue to expect operating expenses to be between $71.5 million and $76.5 million primarily due to continued investment in our sales force expansion efforts, marketing, research and development related to the development of our next generation NeuroStar platform and clinical spending as we pursue additional indications; mainly PTSD and bipolar disorders.

For the second quarter of 2019, we expect total worldwide revenue between $15.6 million and $16.2 million representing 18% and 22% year-over-year growth respectively.

I'll now turn the call back over to Chris.

Chris?

  Thanks, Peter.

2019 is off to a great start as we continue to drive strong revenue growth and enable a greater number of patients to get treatment using NeuroStar Advanced Therapy.

The sustained growth is a direct reflection of our ability to successfully execute in a long-term commercial strategy that we put in place in combination with the development of our industry-leading NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system for the treatment of drug-resistant depression.

We're very excited about the future at Neuronetics.

With that, I'd like now to open up the line for questions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call.

Before I get started, I'd like to welcome Steve Furlong, Neuronetics' new Chief Financial Officer.

Steve brings extensive medical device experience to the team, most notably having spent 14 years at Hologic, where he held a variety of senior leadership positions.

We're very excited to have Steve on board as we look to continue to drive the adoption of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy and expand our market leadership position.

On today's call, I will provide an update on our performance during the second quarter, followed by an update on the progress we made towards our key priorities.

I'll then hand the call over to Steve to walk through our financial performance and guidance for Q3 and 2019, after which we will provide our closing remarks before opening up the line to take your questions.

Our strong performance continued in the second quarter.

Total revenue was $16.6 million, an increase of 25% over the prior year, primarily driven by a 30% growth in the U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy revenue and a 22% growth in U.S.

Treatment Session revenue.

This represents the fifth consecutive quarter since becoming a public company that we've delivered top line growth in excess of 20%.

Moving on to an update on our strategic priorities for the year.

As a reminder, these priorities are to continue the expansion of our sales force and marketing efforts, focus on driving long-term increases in system utilization, launching NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in Japan and selectively evaluate entry into other international markets; develop our next-generation NeuroStar system and beginning the clinical work to set the stage for the expansion of new indications.

Taking each of these in order.

As we look to continue the expansion of our sales force and related marketing efforts in 2019, our goal is to bring our total BDM territories to 59 by the end of the year.

This will be an incremental 15 BDMs versus the end of 2018.

In the second quarter, we filled an additional territory, making that 5 new territories year-to-date, bringing our current BDM territory count to 49.

We continue to be very excited about the quality of the salespeople we're able to attract, and we feel very confident that we can continue to drive predictable growth in new system sales and subsequent treatment session pull-through result.

We have also expanded our regional sales management infrastructure by adding 2 new BDM regions and associated regional manager.

This brings the total number of sales regions to 7 as we scale to support our future growth.

In addition to the expansion of our sales force, we continue to utilize DTC marketing campaigns.

We finished another round of TV commercials that ran from May 13 to June 1.

Following this round of commercials, web traffic was up 72% versus the previous 3 weeks without TV commercials.

During this beta test, we had a new functionality to our website.

Patients who responded to the ad could book an appointment on the line directly with a provider or talk live with a nurse, who could then book qualified patients an appointment.

This feature was designed to increase the lead-to-consult conversion.

I'm pleased to report that we saw positive trends.

And comparing our cost per lead in the most recent television campaign against a similar 3-week television campaign in the fall of 2018, we generated a 5.6 reduction in our cost per lead.

We're continuing to assess the financial merits of this program and further ways to continue to improve conversion of leads and the appropriate mix in our marketing strategy.

As we continue to focus on driving adoption and utilization of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy, we continue to evaluate different pricing models to drive both system and treatment session sales.

One such program we have utilized in certain situations is fixed-price treatment session model.

The interest in this program has picked up recently, particularly as we've continued to be successful in penetrating high-volume accounts that have the resources and patient volume to drive future growth in their practice, either by adding additional systems or opening up new locations.

Our second strategic priority for the year is to drive long-term utilization increases.

As we've noted previously, we will continue to increase the number of CPCs, or Clinical Practice Consultants, and CTCs, or Clinical Training Consultants, in order to maximize the utilization of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy for our customers and patients.

As of the end of the quarter, we're happy to share that we have already met our goal of hiring incremental 5 CPCs and 6 CTCs in 2019.

This brings the total to 29 CPCs and 15 CTCs.

To date, we've installed nearly 1,000 systems and once installed, our primary focus is to ensure that clinicians are well trained to optimize NeuroStar Therapy for patients by utilizing the system proprietary, patented features, including contact sensing and the 6-point alignment system.

We believe that our highly trained CTCs and CPC teams are a key strategic advantage for us and that our focus on training in practice management enables our customers to effectively and consistently deliver the outcomes we generated in our clinical trials to their patients.

We announced in July that the NeuroStar Outcomes Registry has passed 3,000 evaluable patients, making it now the largest registry focused on therapies for the treatment of depression.

The Outcomes Registry includes data from 100 clinical practice sites across the United States and showed that 63% of patients treated with NeuroStar Advanced Therapy experienced significant improvement in the depression symptoms.

This demonstrates real-world outcomes consistent results seen in the Carpenter open-label clinical trial, in which 58% of the patients experienced significant improvement.

Importantly, safety data reported in our registry is also consistent with the findings of previously conducted clinical trials.

Our third strategic priority for the year is the prudent expansion of our global footprint.

Our initial expansion market is Japan.

Earlier this year, we announced that NeuroStar Advanced therapy received national reimbursement in Japan, which went into effect on June 1.

This is a tremendous achievement, and we'll provide psychiatry as a very important option to treat patients with MDD in a country that has one of the highest suicide rates in the world.

We're very excited to announce that we launched commercial in Japan in the second quarter and encouraged with our early progress.

The first patient was treated with NeuroStar Advanced therapy last month.

Our partner Tiejin is targeting the leading teaching hospitals to the largest inpatient and outpatient clinics in Japan.

The initial feedback that they provided is very encouraging.

The June JSPN training course was once again filled to capacity of 150 participants.

So far in 2019, over 50 additional doctors have completed Tiejin's subsequent NeuroStar TMS-specific training.

In addition, a 30-minute documentary aired nationally, featuring TMS as a new technology in mid-July.

Subsequent to this, Tiejin received a number of calls from hospitals, clinics and patients requesting more information.

Overall, Tiejin is off to a good start in this targeted segment.

And you can see in the second quarter, our OUS revenues are up nicely as a result of the most recent round of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system sales to Tiejin.

Another of our strategic priorities is the development and future launch of our next-generation NeuroStar system.

We're in the early stages of a multiyear process.

And in second quarter, we continue to drive towards that goal.

We've met with patients and physician focus groups to gain their feedback on how to improve the reproducibility, precision and efficiency of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy.

These insights are informing our priorities as we develop our next-generation TMS system.

Our final strategic priority for 2019 is to begin the clinical work to set the stage for the expansion of indications for the use of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system.

We're excited about the therapeutic opportunities that PTSD and bipolar indications will bring to our existing providers, new providers and patients globally.

These are disorders that impact a significant population in the U.S. and like depression are difficult-to-treat with pharmacotherapy.

We believe that in our current installed base alone, there are thousands of patients who suffer with these diseases that could potentially benefit from NeuroStar Advanced Therapy.

We're currently on track to have discussions with the FDA later this year to inform our regulatory strategy.

We're progressing very well against these important initiatives, which will support a continued long-term growth.

Overall, we're very excited about our results in the second quarter and how we have positioned ourselves to continue to drive strong top line growth in the business and build upon our market leadership position.

I would now like to hand the call over to Steve to discuss our financial performance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CFO &amp; Company Secretary   [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Thanks, Chris.

Before providing the financial update, I would like to say how excited I am to join the Neuronetics' team and help realize the mission of improving the quality of life for patients who suffer from psychiatric disorders.

Neuronetics has a well-defined leadership position in the TMS space and the track record of growth is truly impressive.

In addition, there is still a significant untapped market for TMS, both for the treatment of MDD as well as other psychiatric disorders.

And I look forward to being a part of Neuronetics as we continue to advance NeuroStar Advanced Therapy to treat these patients.

Now shifting gears to our financial update.

Total revenue for the quarter was $16.6 million, a 25% increase over the prior year quarter.

U.S. revenue was $15.9 million, an increase of 23% over the second quarter of 2018. International revenue was approximately $682,000, an increase of 93% versus the prior year period due primarily to the sale of systems to our distribution partner in Japan.

U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue for the second quarter of 2019 was $4.6 million, an increase of 30% over the second quarter 2018 revenue of $3.6 million.

The increase in U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue was primarily driven by higher capital, upgrades and rent-to-own revenue.

Capital units sold increased by 26%, while average selling prices declined by 9% as compared to last year.

On a sequential basis, average selling prices declined by 4%.

During the quarter, we saw our active installed base increase to 976 units, a net increase of 160 units from the second quarter of 2018 and an increase of 45 units from first quarter 2019.

U.S.

Treatment Session revenue was $10.8 million for the second quarter of 2019, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter.

The increase was primarily due to an approximate 24% increase in the number of treatment sessions sold and an increase in other treatment session revenue.

The increase in treatment sessions purchased was partially offset by a 7% decline in treatment session ASPs due to predetermined volume pricing discounts within our existing customer base.

This is in line with expectations, and these discounts are triggered when customers surpass certain predefined high-volume thresholds.

U.S. service and other revenue was approximately $415,000, a 1% increase over the prior year.

Gross profit for the second quarter 2019 was $12.4 million, an increase of $2.4 million from $10 million during the second quarter of 2018.

Gross margin for the second quarter of 2019 was 74.8%, which was lower than the second quarter of 2018 gross margin of 75.5%.

The decrease in gross margin was the result of a higher mix of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy revenue as well as the selling price decrease as noted above, partially offset by increased leverage on our service and operations cost as a result of higher sales compared to the prior year period.

Sales and marketing expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were $11.5 million, an increase of $1.7 million over the prior year.

This increase was primarily due to the increased size of our sales force as well as spend related to marketing campaigns.

General and administrative expenses were $4.3 million, an increase of approximately $1.2 million compared to the prior year.

The increase was primarily driven by the increased costs associated with being a public company.

Research and development expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were $3.2 million, an increase of approximately $0.9 million from the prior year period.

The increase was primarily due to product development costs related to the continued development of our next-generation platform and higher personnel costs in preparation of new clinical trials.

Net loss for the second quarter was $7.1 million compared to a net loss of $7.5 million in the second quarter of 2018.

EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, for the second quarter of 2019 was a loss of $5.9 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $6.3 million in the second quarter of 2018.

Moving to the balance sheet.

We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $89.6 million compared to $104.6 million at year-end 2018.

Cash usage during the quarter was in line with our expectations.

I would like to note that since we are now eligible to utilize Form S-3, the company will file a shelf registration statement for the offer and sale of up to $125 million of securities on a primary basis.

In addition, this shelf registers 3.5 million shares that may be offered and sold by shareholders on a secondary basis pursuant to an investors' rights agreement.

The filing of this shelf should not be interpreted as an indication that we will be pursuing a financing in the near term.

Rather, this is just a matter of good corporate housekeeping.

Turning to guidance.

For the full year 2019, we are increasing our guidance of total worldwide revenue to between $63 million and $65 million, representing approximately 19% and 23% year-over-year growth, respectively, up from our prior guidance of $62.5 million to $64.5 million and inclusive of our expectations for international revenue for the year.

For the third quarter of 2019, we expect total worldwide revenue of between $15.8 million and $16.4 million, representing 15% and 19% year-over-year growth, respectively.

For the full year 2019, we continue to expect gross margins to be in the mid-70s range, in line with our previous guidance.

For the full year 2019, we now expect operating expenses to be between $74 million and $77.5 million, up from the previous guidance of $71.5 million to $76.5 million.

The small increase in operating expense guidance is primarily driven by our ongoing efforts to drive adoption, including the continued investment in our sales force expansion efforts, marketing, research and development related to the development of our next-generation NeuroStar platform and clinical spending as we pursue additional indications for PTSD and bipolar disorders.

I'll now turn the call back over to Chris.

  Thanks, Steve.

We're very happy about our performance during the first half of 2019, as we have consistently demonstrated the execution of our growth strategy and achieved our financial objectives.

Our ability to sustain growth is a direct reflection of our ability to successfully execute on improving long-term commercial strategy that we put in place in combination with the ongoing development of our industry-leading NeuroStar Advanced therapy system for the treatment of drug-resistant depression and potentially new indications.

As we look to the second half of 2019 and into 2020, we believe our strong foundation in the U.S. as well as our recent expansion internationally sets the stage for continued growth.

With that, I'd like now to open up the line for questions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call.

On today's call, I will provide an update on our performance during the third quarter, followed by an update on a few operational aspects of the business.

I'll then hand the call over to Steve to walk through our financial performance and updated guidance for Q4 and the full year, after which we will provide our closing remarks before opening up the line to take your questions.

Total revenue in the quarter was $16 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year primarily driven by an 18% growth in the U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy revenue and 11% growth in U.S. treatment session revenue.

Results during the quarter were at the lower end of our expectations due to slightly lower productivity in our legacy customer base.

This quarter was another very positive quarter for our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system and was the sixth consecutive quarter in a row that the active installed base increased by approximately 20% over the prior year quarter.

This demonstrates our ability to consistently execute our strategy and the significant potential in what is still a relatively untapped market.

On today's call, I'd like to focus my remarks on the following topics: The ongoing expansion of the BDM, CPC and CTC field sales forces; trends among HVT customers and in particular, TMS-only providers; marketing initiatives designed to raise awareness of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy; the early progress we're seeing in Japan and our plan to expand into new indications beyond major depressive disorder.

Starting with an update on our BDM sales force.

Our goal remains to bring our total BDM territories to 59 by year-end, which would be an increase of 15 versus the end of 2018.

In the third quarter, we filled an additional 8 new territories and now have 13 of the 15 expansion territories filled year-to-date, bringing our current BDM territory count to 57.

We have also been continuing to build a number of CPCs, or clinical practice consultants, and CTCs, or clinical training consultants, in line with the growth of our installed base.

These teams are an important part of the value proposition that we offer customers to ensure that customers are supported in training and building a practice to maximize the utility of the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System.

As of the end of the quarter, there are 33 CPCs and 15 CTCs in the field, and both of these cohorts are in line with our expectations for the size of these groups at the end of 2019.

Going forward, the CPC will be referred to as a NeuroStar Practice Consultant or NPC, better recognizing the value they bring to our customer.

This team's primary focus is working with our customers to help them drive treatment session volume.

While we are trending well with new provider volume growth, we have found that we need to spend a bit more time with our legacy providers as they are not performing as well as expected.

We are revisiting our call point cycles and anticipate this will take some time to optimize.

I would now like to discuss some trends we observed at a few of our larger HVT accounts.

As you may have seen through recent press releases, we're experiencing rapid growth with TMS-only providers who take patient referrals from psychiatrists in the community that don't currently offer TMS.

They do their own local marketing and efficiently convert our DTC efforts.

In September, we announced that our 100th system was installed with Greenbrook TMS, a NeuroStar Advanced Therapy provider with 82 treatment centers across the U.S.

In October, we announced that we have agreed with Success TMS to be the preferred TMS technology at over 21 locations across 21 states.

We're pleased that these large providers, which are multimillion dollar business entities, are choosing to partner with us over other companies in the TMS space.

As these and other large providers expand, they often place multiunit orders, which would require a significant cash outlay.

As a result, these customers are choosing to utilize rent-to-own agreements for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems, which spreads the cash outlay over time and allows them to expand more quickly.

This has led to a significant increase in other NeuroStar revenue during the quarter.

These rent-to-own systems are accounted for as sales-type leases and have a lower ASP than a traditional capital sale.

During the quarter, we also saw a significant uptick in other treatment session revenue, the primary driver of which is a rapid increase in the number of new systems being activated for HVT customers who utilize fixed price purchase agreements.

We view this as a positive indicator of the demand for our therapies among these high volume centers, and we'll continue to opportunistically offer this pricing model to customers who feel that they can drive high volumes of patients and thus, multiple new system purchases over time through their practices.

We're pleased with how our HVT strategy is playing out.

Our ability to successfully partner with larger providers will allow us to continue to expand our installed base and drive predictable high-margin treatment session revenue.

To help support practice utilization, we're continuing to utilize DTC marketing campaigns to expand awareness of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy.

We recently ran a national TV ad campaign in conjunction with National Depression Awareness month to leverage the spotlight on MDD to increase the awareness around NeuroStar Advanced Therapy and how we can help patients who are suffering.

As a reminder, there are over 17 million adult Americans and over 300 million people worldwide that are depressed.

However, less than half will see treatment, which is why increasing awareness of depression and the treatment options is critical.

The October campaign was one of our most successful to date.

Appointment requests increased 64% and physician located searches increased 33% over our May 2019 campaign.

While we are thrilled with these results, we continue to look for ways to optimize the financial return on these campaigns.

We're about to take those learnings and embark on expanded DTC pilot tests from mid-November through January next year.

You may recall that in May, we ran a very successful pilot test where potential patients who responded to a commercial were directed to a call center.

The clinical consultants at the call center determined if the patient would be a good candidate for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy, and if so booked the patient an appointment directly with a nearby NeuroStar psychiatrist.

The purpose of this new pilot will be to determine the ROI on our DTC campaigns with a call center component before deciding how we best move forward.

I'd like to update you on the expansion of our global footprint.

As we announced earlier this year, NeuroStar Advanced Therapy received national reimbursement in Japan, which went into effect on June 1.

The first patient was treated with NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in July.

Subsequent to that, we have had good early commercial traction.

Teijin placed another multisystem order in the quarter as they're beginning to get early adopters up and running.

The sale of these systems was factored into our guidance for the year, although we were not sure whether the sales would occur in the third or fourth quarter.

We currently don't have any additional system sales built into our outlook for the fourth quarter in Japan.

We continue to view Japan as a high potential geography, but do not expect revenue -- but do expect revenues to be lumpy over the near-term as we work with our partner, Teijin, to increase awareness, get psychiatrist trained on the system, get systems installed and ultimately drive treatment session revenue.

Lastly, I'd like to discuss the future expansion of indications for use for the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System.

We're currently working with the FDA to determine the best regulatory path forward to expand our indications to include bipolar and PTSD.

We expect to have some clarity on this pathway in early 2020, and we'll be able to share more at that time.

The TMS market is still in its nascent stages, and the technology continues to gain popularity among psychiatrists, health care providers and patients.

We're enthusiastic about the success we're having with their HVT strategy and our rapidly expanding active installed base.

Overall, we believe that we remain well positioned to continue to drive top line growth in the business and build upon our market leadership position over the long term.

I'd now like to hand the call over to Steve to discuss our financial performance.

  Thanks, Chris.

Total revenue for the quarter was $16 million, a 16% increase over the prior year quarter.

U.S. revenue was $15.3 million, an increase of 13% over the third quarter of 2018.

Outside the U.S., revenue was approximately $700,000, an increase of approximately $490,000 versus the prior year quarter.

U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenue for the third quarter of 2019 was $4.6 million, an increase of 18% over third quarter 2018 revenue of $3.9 million.

As a reminder, this revenue line is comprised of NeuroStar Capital revenue, which is revenue from systems sold and other NeuroStar revenue, which has 3 primary components: Sales-type lease revenue; operating lease revenue; and revenue from upgrades to the 3.0 treatment coil.

As Chris discussed, there were significantly higher number of sales-type leases in the quarter, which led to other NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenue of approximately $1.6 million during the quarter as compared to approximately $500,000 during the third quarter of 2018, representing 240% growth.

NeuroStar Capital revenue in the quarter was driven by a 6% decrease in capital units sold and a 10% decline in average selling prices as compared to last year.

On a sequential basis, average selling prices declined by 3%.

During the quarter, we saw our active installed base increase to 1,032 units, a net increase of 174 units or 20% from the third quarter of 2018 and a net increase of 56 units sequentially.

As a reminder, the active installed base includes capital units sold, sales-type leases and operating leases.

U.S. treatment session revenue was $10.3 million for the third quarter of 2019, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter.

The increase was primarily due to an increase in other treatment session revenue, which represents our fixed price treatment session revenue.

Per click treatment sessions purchased in the quarter grew by approximately 8%.

This increase was partially offset by a 6% decline in treatment session ASPs due to predetermined volume pricing discounts within our existing customer base.

During the quarter, other treatment session revenue was $1.4 million, up from $512,000 during the third quarter of 2018, representing over 170% growth.

U.S. service and other revenue was approximately $426,000, a 9% increase over the prior year.

Gross profit for the third quarter 2019 was $11.8 million, an increase of $1.1 million from $10.7 million during the third quarter of 2018.

Gross margin for the third quarter of 2019 was 73.8%, which was lower than the third quarter of 2018 gross margin of 77.9%.

The decrease in gross margin was the result of a higher mix of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy revenue and lower average selling prices as a result of a higher portion of new systems placed as sales-type leases.

Sales and marketing expenses for the third quarter of 2019 were $10.4 million, an increase of approximately $700,000 over the prior year.

This increase was primarily due to the increased size of our sales force as well as spend related to marketing campaigns.

General and administrative expenses were $4.3 million, an increase of approximately $1 million compared to the prior year.

This increase was primarily driven by increased compensation-related expenses.

Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2019 were $3.5 million, an increase of approximately $1.4 million from the prior year period.

The increase was primarily due to product development costs related to the continued development of our next-generation platform and higher personnel costs in preparation of the clinical trials.

Net loss for the third quarter was $6.9 million compared to a net loss of $5 million in the third quarter of 2018.

EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure for the third quarter of 2019, was a loss of $5.6 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $3.8 million in the third quarter of 2018.

Moving to the balance sheet.

We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $82.4 million compared to $104.6 million at year-end 2018.

Turning to guidance.

For the full year 2019, we are reducing our guidance of total worldwide revenue to between $62 million and $63 million representing approximately 17% and 19% year-over-year growth, respectively, down from our prior guidance of $63 million and $65 million.

The primary driver of the reduction in full year revenue guidance is lower-than-expected average selling prices and lower-than-expected volumes in certain existing customers.

For the fourth quarter of 2019, we expect total worldwide revenue of between $16.7 million and $17.7 million, representing 7% and 13% year-over-year growth, respectively.

For the full year 2019, we continue to expect gross margins to be in the mid-70s range, in line with our previous guidance.

For the full year 2019, we now expect operating expenses to be between $73.5 million and $75.5 million, down slightly from our previous guidance of $74 million to $77.5 million.

I'll now turn the call back over to Chris.

  Thanks, Steve.

We continue to be very excited by the opportunity for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy to help a significant number of patients worldwide who suffer from major depressive disorder.

We're pleased with our success in partnering with some of the largest HVT providers and enthusiastic about this segment of the market and our leadership position.

We continue to optimize our industry-leading commercial infrastructure to support our expanding customer base and our marketing efforts to raise awareness of TMS as a treatment for those suffering from depression.

Longer term, we're enthusiastic about our ability to expand indications to bring relief to an even greater number of patients suffering from psychiatric disorders.

With that, I'd like now to open up the line for questions.

  Thanks, Mark.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.

On today's call, I'll provide an update on our performance during the fourth quarter, followed by an update on a few strategic aspects of the business.

I'll then hand the call over to Steve to walk through our financial performance, after which I'll provide an update on the business going forward, including guidance for 2020.

Then we'll open up the line to take your questions.

Total revenue in the quarter was $17.4 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year primarily driven by 14% growth in U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy revenue and 13% growth in U.S. NeuroStar treatment session revenue.

These results were in line with our expectations for the quarter, and we continue to be pleased with the pace at which we've been able to consistently grow our installed base, with the fourth quarter representing the seventh consecutive quarter in which the active installed base has grown approximately 20% over the prior year quarter.

Through the continued execution of our commercial strategy, we've been able to consistently penetrate and take advantage of the large untapped market that exists in the U.S.

Starting with an update on Business Development Managers or BDM sales force.

As noted on previous calls, our goal for the year was to bring our total BDM territories to 59 by the end of 2019, and we met that goal.

We also ended 2019 with 33 NeuroStar practice consultants and 15 clinical training consultants, in line with the plan we laid out at the beginning of 2019.

The NPCs and CTCs are an important part of the value proposition that we offer to ensure that customers are supported in training and operationalizing NeuroStar in their practices.

We continue to evaluate how to best resource our commercial team across BDMs, NPCs and CTCs to ensure the right balance between NeuroStar sales, driving system utilization and providing a high level of training and customer support.

As I'll discuss later, we're going to make a modest shift in the focus of our commercial resources towards NPCs and CTCs in 2020.

We had another quarter of strong system sales with our TMS-only providers.

As a reminder, these are large businesses often having multiple sites across the country who either receive patient referrals from psychiatrists in the community that don't currently offer TMS or market directly to patients struggling with depression or both.

We're thrilled at the pace at which we've been able to become the preferred partner to many of the country's largest TMS-only providers, and we will continue to focus on this attractive segment in the market as these providers are likely to drive consistently higher volumes of patients and make multiple new system purchases over time.

On our last call, we mentioned a decline in system utilization amongst a subset of our legacy customer base.

We did a thorough analysis of these accounts to determine the underlying cause of the slowdown and have worked with our sales and marketing teams to develop our strategy to reverse these trends.

We found that there is room for improvement in utilization on a majority of these customers with the right combination of training and support.

We did not expect to see a market improvement in the utilization of these systems in the fourth quarter as we're still in the process of working with these practices.

However, we believe that we can deliver improved utilization in 2020.

Shifting gears to our global expansion efforts.

We continue to see solid early commercial traction in Japan following our positive reimbursement decision in June of 2019.

We view Japan as a high potential geography and are very pleased with the work that our partner, Teijin, has done so far to develop the market.

We expect revenues to be lumpy in the near-term as we work with Teijin to increase awareness, system installations and psychiatrists training with a goal of driving both capital and treatment session revenues.

Lastly, I'd like to discuss the future expansion of indications for use for the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system.

We're very excited to announce that the company's recently received Breakthrough Device Designation in the U.S. from the FDA for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy treatment for bipolar disorder.

Breakthrough Designation provides several potential advantages, including a proactive and faster dialogue with the FDA, the potential for innovative clinical trial design via the program's clinical protocol agreement process and an expedited review process of the company's submissions to the FDA.

It also validates the need for an effective nonpharmaceutical treatment option for this disorder.

We're working with the FDA to determine the specific clinical study design and expect to have some clarity on this later in the year, at which time, we'll share more details.

Overall, we believe that we remain well positioned to continue to drive top line growth in the business and build upon our market leadership position over the long term.

Despite some recent lumpiness and utilization among the small percentage of our customers, throughout the year we have continuously demonstrated our ability to drive the adoption and utilization of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy.

I'd now like to hand the call over to Steve to discuss our financial performance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CFO   [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Thanks, Chris.

Before I provide a review of our fourth quarter financial performance, I would like to bring your attention to a change in the way we are going to report our U.S. revenues.

As our business has evolved, as a result of the increased usage of sales-type leases as well as fixed price treatment session contracts, the composition of our U.S. revenue has shifted.

In an effort to provide investors with the most useful information on our business, we have changed how we present our U.S. revenue.

Under the new reporting structure, U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue will be reported as 3 separate items: NeuroStar capital revenue, the significant majority of system revenue, which consists of revenue from capital sales and revenue from sales-type leases; operating lease revenue, which consists of revenue recognized from units previously rented; and other revenue, primarily revenue generated from the sale of treatment coil upgrades.

In addition to providing a breakout of these 3 items within U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue, we will be providing a number of new systems installed in the U.S. during the quarter.

This number represents the total number of units sold in the U.S. as either a capital sale or a sales-type lease.

Total U.S. treatment session revenue is comprised of all U.S. treatment session revenues from both our per click business as well as our fixed-price contracts.

Going forward, we will provide an average revenue per active system metric defined as total U.S. treatment session revenue divided by the U.S. active installed base at the end of the prior quarter.

We will be providing a supplemental disclosure document on the IR portion of our website, which includes a quarterly historical breakout of the new U.S. revenue reporting structure for 2018 and 2019.

Turning to the quarterly results.

Total revenue for the quarter was $17.4 million, an 11% increase over the prior year quarter.

U.S. revenue was $17 million, an increase of 13% over the fourth quarter of 2018. International revenue was approximately $325,000, a decrease of approximately $220,000 versus the prior year quarter.

The year-over-year decrease was a function of the initial stocking order of systems placed by Teijin during the fourth quarter of 2018 that did not recur this year.

U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $5.4 million, an increase of 14% over fourth quarter 2018 revenue of $4.8 million.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, NeuroStar capital revenue was $5 million, an increase of 14% over the fourth quarter of 2018.

In the quarter, a total of 78 units were sold compared to 65 units in the fourth quarter of 2018.

As anticipated, blended average selling prices declined 11% as compared to the prior year due to a higher mix of sales-type leases versus capital sales and lower prices on capital sales.

We expect that average selling prices will fluctuate based on the mix of capital sales and sales-type leases as well as underlying pricing trends.

During the quarter, we saw our active installed base increase by 21% to 1,085 units, a net increase of 178 units from the fourth quarter of 2018 and a net increase of 53 units sequentially.

As a reminder, the active installed base includes capital units sold, sales-type leases and operating lease units.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, U.S. operating lease revenue was $176,000, a decrease of 24% as compared to the prior year quarter.

Due to the accounting change that went into effect in 2019, we don't currently expect to install any new systems under operating lease agreements.

And thus, this revenue number will eventually go to 0.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, other U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue was $278,000, an increase of 50% over the prior year quarter as we saw an increase in the number of treatment coil upgrades compared to the prior year quarter.

Turning to U.S. treatment session revenues.

U.S. treatment session revenue was $11.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter.

The increase in treatment session revenue was driven by our larger customer base, purchasing more treatment sessions and a larger number of systems installed under fixed-price contracts.

During the quarter, average revenue per active system was approximately $10,900, a decrease of 5% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to the substantial number of new systems sold in the last 18 months that have not yet ramped up to steady state utilization and price declines for per click treatment session.

U.S. service and other revenue was approximately $376,000, a 12% decline over the prior year.

Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $13.1 million, an increase of $1.2 million from $11.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2018.

We continue to generate very strong gross margins in the fourth quarter of 2019 at 75.7%, down just a bit from the fourth quarter of 2018 gross margin of 76.3%.

This small decrease in gross margin resulted from a higher mix of sales-type leases and lower average selling prices on capital system sales.

Sales and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $11.5 million, an increase of approximately $825,000 over the prior year.

This increase was primarily due to the increased size of our sales force.

General and administrative expenses were $4.3 million, a decrease of approximately $385,000 compared to the prior year.

This decrease was primarily driven by the year-over-year timing of public company costs.

Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $4.2 million, an increase of approximately $2 million from the prior year period.

The increase was primarily due to product development costs related to the continued development of our next-generation platform and higher personnel costs in preparation for clinical trials.

Net loss for the fourth quarter was $7.6 million compared to a net loss of $6.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.

EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, for the fourth quarter of 2019 was a loss of $6.3 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Moving to the balance sheet.

We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $75.7 million compared to $104.6 million at the end of 2018.

We are pleased to announce we closed on a $50 million term loan with Solar Capital, which allows us to repay the $30 million currently outstanding on our prior debt facility within the interest-only period and provides for additional capital to bolster our balance sheet at favorable terms.

The debt is available in 2 tranches, which would be funded as follows: tranche 1, $35 million, funded yesterday; tranche 2, $15 million, will be available to be funded on or before December 15, 2021, at our request and within 30 days of our achieving a net product revenue milestone measured on a trailing 12-month basis, measured on or before November 30, 2021.

The interest-only period on the initial tranche is 24 months but can be extended by an additional 12 months on our achieving a net product revenue milestone measured on a trailing 12-month basis, measured again on or before November 30, 2021.

I'll now turn the call back over to Chris.

  Thanks, Steve.

As we move into 2020 and beyond, we'll be putting an increased focus on accelerating our pathway to profitability.

As a result, we'll be taking some actions with our spending and strategic initiatives this year, focusing on a path to EBITDA positive in late 2022 to early 2023.

We also would note that we believe that cash on hand combined with credit available to us is sufficient to get us to EBITDA positive.

Starting with the sales force.

Over the last couple of years, we've gone through a period of rapid expansion, and we currently believe that BDM territories in the mid-50s is the most appropriate and optimal number of territories that cover the U.S. at this time.

Despite the slight decline in the total number of territories versus where we ended 2019, we believe that we can continue to drive growth in new system installations as a number of BDM full-time equivalents or FTEs will actually be higher in 2020 than 2019 due to the cadence of hiring throughout the year.

We've also expanded our HVT-targeted universe to the top 5,700 solo and group practices in the U.S. that treat 60% of the MDD patients in these types of practices.

This gives the BDMs more accounts to prospect and optimizes the BDMs' productivity at this juncture.

In order to keep up with our growing installed base, we will add NPCs and CTCs to drive new system ramp up and facilitate ongoing utilization.

Thus, in 2020, we expect to hire 7 NPCs as well as a regional manager, along with 2 additional CTCs.

Another area of the business we're adjusting is our international expansion efforts.

In the past, we have considered entering a number of incremental geographic regions in Western Europe and Asia.

However, given the large greenfield opportunities in both the U.S. and Japan that still exists, we will remain focused on these regions exclusively for the time being.

I would now like to discuss our product and clinical development efforts.

As noted earlier, we just received Breakthrough Device Designation for bipolar disorder from the FDA, so we decided to concentrate our near-term efforts on this indication.

Bipolar disorder by definition is someone that has undergone episode of depression followed by an episode of mania.

We're going to focus on the greatest unmet need, which is the episode of depression.

We remain interested in pursuing a PTSD indication as well, but think it's prudent from a cash management and profitability perspective to prioritize our clinical development activities first on the bipolar disorder.

We are also continuing development of our next-generation NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system with an eye on improved usability, precision and reproducibility.

Turning to guidance for the full year 2020.

We're setting guidance of total worldwide revenue to between $69 million and $71 million, representing approximately 10% to 13% year-over-year growth, respectively.

For the first quarter of 2020, we expect worldwide revenue of between $13.5 million and $14 million, representing 6% and 10% year-over-year growth, respectively.

For the full year 2020, we expect to generate strong gross margins to remain in the mid-70% range, and we expect operating expenses to between $76 million and $78 million.

We're very excited about the opportunity for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy to help a significant number of patients who suffer from major depressive disorder.

We intend to maintain our market share leadership position in the category by offering the most advanced and effective technology and the best customer support to the largest and most sophisticated commercial team in the industry.

We plan to leverage this team to continue to expand our installed base at an impressive rate, drive system utilization and provide best-in-class customer support and training.

Our commercial strategy remains consistent as we continue to focus on both the TMS-only and HVT providers, and we will continue to invest prudently in marketing programs to drive awareness of our therapy with patients and increased systems use at customers' practices.

We look forward to updating you on our progress during the year.

With that, I'd like to open up the line for questions.

 Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the first quarter 2020 financial and operating results conference call.

(Operator Instructions)
 I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Mark Klausner.

Thank you.

And please go ahead, sir.

 Thank you, operator.

Good morning and thank you for joining us for Neuronetics' First Quarter 2020 Conference Call.

A replay of this call will be available on our website for 30 days.

Joining me on today's call are Neuronetics' Chief Financial Officer Steve Furlong; and Andy Macan, Senior Vice President and General Counsel.

Steve and Andy are also members of the Company's Office of the President.

Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements covered under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements related to our business strategy, financial and revenue guidance, the impact of COVID-19, and other operational issues and metrics.

Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business.

For a discussion of risks and uncertainties associated with Neuronetics' business, I encourage you to review the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including the company's annual report on Form 10-K filed on March 3, 2020 and quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which will be filed later today.

The company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the course of this call except as required by law.

During the call, we'll also discuss certain information on a non-GAAP basis, including EBITDA.

Management believes that non-GAAP financial information taken in conjunction with U.S. GAAP financial measures provides useful information for both management and investors by excluding certain noncash and other expenses that are not indicative of trends in our operating results.

Management uses non-GAAP financial measures to compare our performance relative to forecast and strategic plans to benchmark our performance externally against competitors and for certain compensation decisions.

Reconciliations between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results are presented in tables accompanying our press release, which can be viewed on our website.

With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Neuronetics' Chief Financial Officer, Steve Furlong.

 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.

On today's call, I'll provide an update on recent events that have occurred within the company along with an overview of how the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic turmoil are impacting our business.

I'll then provide an overview of our first quarter financial results, provide our thoughts on the remainder of the year and then open the call up for your questions.

Beginning with the management transition, in early March, the company announced the transition and senior management.

The Board of Directors established an interim Office of the President, made up of myself and Andy Macan, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, to lead the business while the company recruits a new CEO.

Additionally, Brian Farley, the company's Chairman of the Board was appointed as the Board's liaison to the Office of the President.

The Board of Directors has appointed an Executive Search Committee and has engaged a recruiting firm who is performing a formal search for a permanent CEO.

In the meantime, we continue to drive the company's tactical and strategic initiatives with the goal of maintaining and expanding our market leading position.

Shifting gears, I would like to provide an update on our response to the impact of COVID-19 as well as an update on our business more generally.

As previously announced, we have experienced a material impact on our business from COVID-19.

As a result, we have taken numerous proactive steps aimed at keeping our employees and customers safe, continuing to support our customers and their patients during the crisis and managing our capital resources with a view towards both near- and long-term business continuity.

Depression is a debilitating condition that millions of patients suffer from worldwide and for those undergoing or in need of TMS treatment for depression, we believe that TMS treatment is a medical necessity.

The company is not aware of any COVID-19-related government order that prohibits the initiation or continuation of TMS therapy for the treatment of depression.

We estimate today that approximately 1/3 of our customers have temporarily suspended treating patients while many others have heavily curtailed TMS patient treatments.

We believe adoption of safe and appropriate pandemic operating procedures by our customers is possible, and many customers have already established these operating protocols.

To facilitate safe ongoing use of the company's products, the company has provided customers with clear sanitizing and disinfecting procedures for the NeuroStar TMS Therapy system.

Clinical associations such as the Clinical TMS Society are similarly providing guidance to practitioners on delivery of this important therapy in a manner that is protective of both patients and practitioners.

At this time, it is not clear when practices that have suspended or curtailed in-person patient treatments will begin to restart patient treatments utilizing the pandemic TMS and patient treatment protocols.

In the short term, we expect that our capital equipment sales and treatment session revenues will be materially impacted by this pandemic as customers are deferring capital purchase decisions, and new patient treatment starts and system utilization have declined compared to our pre-COVID-19 projections.

In the first quarter, total revenue was $11.5 million, down 10% versus the prior-year quarter.

During the first 2 months of the year we were on track to hit our previously issued revenue guidance for the quarter.

Beginning in mid-March, as the spread of COVID-19 and related stay-at-home orders accelerated in the U.S., we started to see a significant decline in both new system sales and treatment session volumes.

Despite our belief that TMS treatment is a medical necessity for the treatment of depression, system sales slowed and various levels of shelter-in-place initiatives to turn patients from seeking treatment and cause some customers to temporarily reduce or cease providing TMS Therapy.

As a result of both the recent management transition and the anticipated impact of COVID-19, the company implemented a number of steps to adjust the size of the business with a focus on both near- and long-term business continuity.

Even before COVID-19, we were evaluating the company's commercial model with the goal of rightsizing our organization.

Prior to the restructuring implemented on April 8th, the company had 213 employees including a 152 in the sales and marketing organization.

After the restructuring, which involved layoffs, furloughs and spending decreases, the company has a 117 employees, of which 74 are in the sales and marketing organization.

It was a difficult decision to reduce staffing but in doing so, we believe the company is in a far better position to weather a prolonged impact of the pandemic on our business and come out successfully.

We also reduced our marketing spend and delayed certain projects to reduce expenses and conserve cash.

The full financial effect of these changes will emerge in the third quarter of 2020.

We now project operating expenses in the second half of 2020 to range from $25 million to $27 million.

This represents a projected reduction of our operating expenses in the second half of 2020 of approximately one-third compared to the first half of the year.

It is our belief that the company can maintain industry leading customer service with fewer people and more efficient processes.

Given the restructuring and the ongoing economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, our priorities have shifted accordingly.

We had previously calibrated our commercial organization using a traditional sales representative productivity model, where the majority of the growth in the business was driven primarily by adding BDM to drive system placements and adding MPCs and CTCs to improve system utilization.

With the current revenue pressures along with the shift in our customer base to a higher mix of 'TMS-only providers', who have unique buying preferences and system utilization, we now believe that we can support the future growth of the business with this realigned commercial organization.

As it relates to our geographic expansion efforts, we have previously indicated that we will continue to focus exclusively on the opportunity that exists in Japan.

That strategy remains unchanged, as we still view Japan as a medium-term growth driver for the business.

While our expectations for the revenue contribution from Japan for this year were not initially significant, we have started to see a negative impact from COVID-19, similar to what we are experiencing in the U.S. We will continue to monitor the situation alongside our distribution partner Teijin with our goal of anticipating and appropriately reacting to changing conditions in Japan.

Lastly, as to our indication expansion efforts, we are continuing dialog with the FDA regarding appropriate study designs for demonstrating efficacy in treating bipolar disorder and potentially other indications.

Before shifting to a financial review, I would like to briefly comment on the limited duration stockholder rights plan that we recently announced.

The Board believes that the Company's current trading level does not reflect Neuronetics' inherent value or the potential of our products and strategy execution.

Given the share price dislocations created by an extremely turbulent market, the Board of Directors adopted the rights plan to protect all shareholders' best interests.

The rights plan is designed to guard against opportunistic tactics to exert control over the company during this period of economic uncertainty and market volatility, protect long-term shareholder value, and ensure that all of our shareholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of the company.

For further details regarding the rights plan, please review the current report on Form 8-K filed on April 8, 2020.

Now shifting gears to a financial review, total revenue for the first quarter of 2020 was $11.5 million, a 10% decrease compared to first quarter 2019 revenue of $12.7 million.

From the beginning of the year until mid-March, we were on track to meet our previously announced guidance of $13.5 million to $14 million.

Starting in mid-March, the COVID-19 pandemic, government-mandated social distancing and the resulting economic turmoil caused a significant drop-off in performance across our business.

Our system sales were heavily impacted in late March as many customers deferred or delayed purchasing decisions due to the impact of COVID-19.

Nevertheless, our sales team was able to successfully sell 38 NeuroStar systems in Q1, 2020, compared to 43 systems in Q1, 2019.

Similarly treatment session volumes, both from ongoing treatment and new patient starts, declined substantially beginning in mid-March as shelter-in-place orders and other similar restrictions were put in place throughout the United States.

To provide some context on the magnitude of the decline, we are going to share some operating metrics that we typically do not disclose and do not anticipate providing on an ongoing basis.

In March, we saw 21% year-over-year decline in per-click treatment session volume even though the COVID-19 disruptions did not substantially impact our business until the second half of March.

New patient starts across all of our customers fell by an average of over 55% during the final 2 weeks of March as compared to the average weekly run rate during January and February.

The trends that we experienced in late March continued into April.

Total revenue for the month was down approximately 45% versus April of last year.

Total U.S. capital revenue was most significantly impacted from a year-over-year perspective, down approximately 80% as customers continued to defer or delay purchasing decisions.

Within the treatment session portion of the business, we saw continued year-over-year slowdown in April with total treatment session revenue down approximately 33%.

The decline was primarily driven by a significant increase in per-click treatment session volumes.

The U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue for the first quarter of 2020 was $2.6 million, a decrease of 23% versus first quarter 2019 revenue of $3.3 million.

The decrease was primarily driven by fewer NeuroStar system sales as well as lower other revenues related to HP coil revenue in the first quarter of 2020.

We expect that average selling prices will fluctuate based on the mix of capital sales and sales-type leases as well as underlying pricing trends.

In the first quarter, NeuroStar capital revenue was $2.4 million, a decrease of 18% compared to first quarter 2019 revenue of $2.9 million.

During the quarter, we saw our active installed base increase by 20% to 1,119 units, a net increase of 188 units from the first quarter of 2019 and a net increase of 34 units sequentially.

As a reminder, the active installed base includes capital units sold, sales-type leases and operating lease units.

In the first quarter, US operating lease revenue was $155,000, a decrease of 15% compared to the prior-year quarter.

Due to the accounting change that went into effect in 2019, we don't currently expect to install any new systems under operating lease agreements and thus this revenue number will eventually go to 0 as the terms of these operating leases expire.

In the first quarter of 2020 other U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue was $29,000, a decrease of approximately 80% over the prior-year quarter as we saw a significant decline in the number of treatment coil upgrades purchased during the quarter.

Turning to U.S. treatment session revenue, U.S. treatment session revenue was $8.2 million for the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of 7% over the prior year quarter.

The decrease in treatment session revenue was driven by a decline in average revenue per active system, largely caused by a material reduction and per click treatment session volume during March, caused by COVID-19.

During the quarter, average revenue per active system was approximately $7,600, a decrease of 22% from the prior year quarter primarily driven by a 16% year-over-year decrease in U.S. treatment session revenues during March, being spread over a much larger active installed base during the first quarter of 2020.

Gross margin for the first quarter of 2020 was 75.5% compared to first quarter 2019 gross margin of 77.9%.

The decrease was the result of lower blended NeuroStar capital system ASPs as well as lower per-click treatment session volumes during the quarter.

Operating expenses during the first quarter of 2020 were $19.1 million, an increase of $2.1 million compared to $17 million in the first quarter of 2019.

The increase was primarily driven by sales force, higher product and clinical development expenses, as well as management transition costs.

Net loss for the quarter -- for the first quarter of 2020 was $12.6 million or negative $0.68 per share as compared to first quarter 2019 loss of $7.5 million or negative $0.42 per share.

EBITDA for the first quarter of 2020 was negative $10.5 million as compared to the first quarter of 2019 EBITDA of negative $6.4 million.

Moving to the balance sheet, as noted earlier we have put in a significant amount of effort aimed at ensuring that we have adequate capital resources and liquidity to support the business over both the near and long term.

As of March 31, cash and cash equivalents were $63.6 million.

On April 27, we disclosed that we had applied for and received a $6.4 million loan from the Paycheck Protection Program.

The intent of the PPP is to help small businesses, like Neuronetics, and their employees weather the COVID-19 pandemic and the business-closure mandates enacted through the US.

Neuronetics intended to use the PPP loan proceeds for exactly these purposes.

Due to questions concerning the eligibility of public companies similarly situated to the Company, the Company will repay its PPP loan on or before May 7, 2020.

Frankly, it's a shame.

The PPP could have provided an important bridge to companies like ours that have been severely [impact] by COVID-19 and lacked access to other forms of liquidity.

The PPP loan would have benefited our employees and partially mitigated the significant disruption that COVID-19 has had on our business.

Beyond conserving cash, we are significantly reducing operating expenses.

The Company now estimates operating expenses for the full year 2020 to be in the range of $58 million to $60 million, compared to the previously issued guidance of $76 million to $78 million.

Based on the restructuring of the business and the realignment of our strategy, we expect operating expenses to be in the range of $12 million to $14 million per quarter.

[At] these levels, we now believe that we are likely to achieve operating-income breakeven at revenue of $18 million to $20 million per quarter.

Looking into the balance of 2020, given the ongoing disruption caused by COVID-19, we withdrew our full-year 2020 revenue guidance in early April.

With substantially all of our revenues generated in the US, our revenue performance during the remainder of the year will be driven in large part by the cadence of reductions and eventual elimination of COVID-19-related stay-at-home orders and social-distancing restrictions throughout the Country.

Q2 capital-equipment placements will be highly correlated with new and existing customers' willingness to expand their TMS service capabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic and their abilities to secure financing through third-party lenders.

We will continue to drive revenue from treatment sessions where practices are actively treating patients, but we acknowledge that the volume of treatment sessions being purchased is materially lower than we would typically see.

Based on these expectations and our April results, we expect our second-quarter revenue to be down materially, both sequentially and year over year.

Once restrictions have been eased, we believe there is the potential for a return in demand for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in the back half of the year.

There will not only be a backlog of patients who have not been able to access treatment during the quarantine who will seek it, but we believe it is entirely possible to see a spike in new patient starts in response to the intense strain put upon many Americans during this period.

Any such increased demand for mental health services should help to keep psychiatric practices and providers in good economic health.

Like these customers, we are in a good position to help a potentially growing number of MDD patients as they become suitable for TMS, making our therapy more important than ever.

With that, I would like to open up the line for questions.

With me on today's call is Neuronetics' newly appointed President and Chief Executive Officer, Keith Sullivan.

After Keith provides an introduction, I will shift to a high-level overview of our second quarter performance and recent trends in the business, after which I will review our second quarter results and then provide our thoughts on the balance of the year.

I will then turn the call back over to Keith for his thoughts on near-term initiatives before opening the line for questions.

With that, I would like to hand the call over to Keith.

Keith?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks, Steve, and thanks, everyone, for joining us for our call today.

I want to begin by saying how excited I am to be joining Neuronetics.

I'm incredibly enthusiastic about the long-term opportunity that exists for the company to improve the quality of life for patients suffering from psychiatric disorders.

Let me give you a brief overview of my background.

I've been in the medical device space for almost 3 decades.

Before joining Neuronetics, I spent over 5 years at ZELTIQ in leadership roles within the commercial organization, ending my tenure as President and Chief Commercial Officer at the time that Allergan acquired the company in 2017.

Prior to ZELTIQ, I have held leadership roles at a variety of pharmaceutical and medical device companies, including Medicis Pharmaceuticals, Reliant Technologies, Medtronic and Coherent Medical.

Before the Neuronetics opportunity arose, I had independently spent a fair amount of time examining the TMS industry as a whole as well as Neuronetics specifically.

In fact, I was a consultant to the company on 2 occasions prior to and immediately after the commercial launch of NeuroStar.

While a professor at the Mason School of Business at William &amp; Mary, I wrote and taught a case study on the TMS-only provider business with a focus on Greenbrook TMS, Neuronetics' largest customer.

In addition, I have known Bruce Shook for years.

As you're aware, Bruce recently rejoined Neuronetics as a Board member after having cofounded and led the company for a number of years as CEO.

I'd like to share with you what made me excited about the opportunity and why I think the company has such a bright future.

First, we are the unquestioned market leader in a rapidly growing in-demand therapeutic sector.

We have more systems installed and have treated and helped more patients than all other TMS providers combined.

Second, we have a tremendous technology supported by the highest quality clinical data in the industry.

Because of this, our systems are proven, reliable and clinically robust.

Third, we have a well-established commercial infrastructure that has been reorganized over the last few months and now has the potential to drive meaningful growth.

Our focus is to drive greater awareness of the benefits of NeuroStar amongst patients as well as provide meaningful support to our psychiatry providers.

And lastly, we have a great team here at Neuronetics, and I'm impressed with their knowledge, motivation and dedication to our mission.

Having said that, I believe that there are areas of the business that can be optimized to best take advantage of the opportunity that exists.

Only a few weeks on the job, I am currently in the process of digging into every aspect of the business as well as talking to customers and patients to make sure that I fully understand the current needs of the market.

Using those insights, we will put them into the -- place the optimal strategy to drive the highest quality therapy to the greatest number of people.

While it is too early to provide a detailed outline of our long-term strategy, what I know at this point is that with the tremendous foundation that exists today, we can take this business to the next level and drive long-term success, allowing us to help more patients suffering from psychiatric disorders.

With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Steve to provide an update for the second quarter.

Steve?

 Thanks, Keith.

Total revenue for the second quarter was $9.7 million, down 41% over the prior year, primarily as a result of COVID-19, which persisted throughout the quarter, causing an impact to both our capital equipment sales and the utilization of systems in the field.

Given the challenges presented by COVID, we are pleased with the performance of the business during the period.

On the capital equipment side, after an April in which new system sales were effectively shut down, we saw a strong sequential uptick in May and June.

Another key metric of performance is per-click treatment session volumes.

While these volumes continue to slow down in May, we have seen a reversal of that trend in June, and we now believe that May will represent the low point for treatment session volumes for the year.

At the end of the quarter, we estimate that approximately 80% of our customers were back up and running, up from 70% that we noted on May's call.

Based on the 80% of customers who are on our cloud-based TrakStar management tool, we have seen an approximate 70% increase in average daily treatment session volume from the low point in early May through the end of June.

We have seen similar trends and new patient starts as defined by patients doing a motor threshold test.

After hitting a trough in early May, new patient starts at the end of June are approaching the volumes we were seeing in January and February.

Capital purchases have begun to come back but at a slower rate than the rebound in system utilization.

For much of the second quarter, our BDMs were frozen out of the market due to travel and social distancing restrictions.

Where these restrictions have started to ease, BDMs have begun to get back out into the field to prospect accounts.

We do anticipate that capital sales will continue to rebound, albeit at a slower rate.

I would like to provide an update on some key topics related to the business.

As a result of the current environment, we are seeing an increased focus on mental health throughout the United States, which recent prescription data has reinforced.

In an April Express Scripts report, data showed that the use of prescription drugs to treat mental health conditions increased by more than 20% between mid-February and mid-March, with prescriptions for antidepressants increasing by 18%.

Importantly, when looking at prescriptions filled during the week of March 15, 78% were new prescriptions.

This indicates a significant increase in patients suffering from depression who are seeking care.

While this is a point in time estimate during a notably stressful period in American history, we continue to believe that there will be a significant uptick in depression patients, many of whom will ultimately fail pharmaceutical treatment and will be seeking an alternative therapy.

As we announced in April, we restructured our commercial organization as part of our corporate reorganization.

This included a substantial reduction in headcount within our sales team.

At the end of the quarter, that team consists of approximately 45 employees spread between the 3 key roles: business development managers or BDMs, who are focused on capital sales; NeuroStar practice consultants or NPCs, who are focused on operationalizing and driving the utilization of systems within practices; and clinical training consultants or CTCs, who are focused on training psychiatrists and staff on proper usage of systems once installed.

At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately 16 BDMs, 17 NPCs and 7 CTCs.

While we added back a few NPCs and CTCs in July to service the improving system utilization, we may selectively increase the size of the team in the future.

We believe the size and structure of the sales force will allow us to generate top line growth by focusing on driving increased system utilization and by more effectively deploying our BDMs.

On our last call, we noted that with psychiatrist offices closed and patients being held under social distancing restrictions, we reduced spending on certain marketing initiatives to conserve cash.

We did, however, continue to actively invest in areas that we think will benefit the company, our customers and patients over the long run.

Initiatives like the call center pilot, virtual training and digital marketing.

Our call center pilot connects patients who visit our website to a live call center operator who can then schedule an appointment directly with the psychiatrists in their area.

The early indications from this pilot are exceeding our expectations, and we are in the process of planning for a broader launch later in 2020.

In response to the COVID pandemic and a need to continue to support NeuroStar practices staying open to treat TMS patients, we offered a series of webinars in the second quarter.

Over 900 individuals registered for these webinars on topics ranging from peace of mind for patients that provided videos on how to prepare the office and treat patients with TMS during COVID to TMS coverage and reimbursement update that outlines several recent positive changes in coverage.

On the digital marketing front, we continue to leverage this cost-effective method to educate patients and psychiatrists on the benefits of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy.

We have also seen notable progress in our reimbursement landscape recently.

Our FDA current indication is adult patients who have failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from one prior antidepressant medication.

However, many payers have taken a more conservative approach in terms of the number of failed drugs before they will reimburse for NeuroStar Therapy.

As a company, we have been working with payers to change that and make NeuroStar Advanced Therapy more readily available for patients seeking to manage their depression.

During the quarter, we had several notable wins, including Cigna, which represents 16 million covered lives.

We were able to reduce pharmacotherapy criteria from 4 failed drugs to 2 failed drugs or intolerance to 1 medical trial.

Aetna, which represents 22 million covered lives, we were able to extend coverage to include patients between 18 and 21 years old where it previously had been exclusively for 21 years old and over, added a provision for retreatment approval based on 50% improvement and reduced pharmacotherapy criteria from 4 failed drugs to 2 failed drugs.

And finally, HCSC/Blue Cross/Blue Shield, which represents 15 million covered lives, we were able to reduce pharmacotherapy criteria from 4 failed drugs to 2 failed drugs.

We view this as a meaningful progress towards making it easier for patients to get access to NeuroStar Advanced Therapy and should lead to an increase in new patient start volumes over the longer term.

We will continue to work to make this shift more broadly adopted among all payers.

Shifting gears to our financial performance.

Total revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was $9.7 million, a 41% decrease compared to the second quarter 2019 revenue of $16.6 million.

This was primarily a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, related governmental responses and resulting economic turmoil.

U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was $2.3 million, a decrease of 49% versus second quarter 2019 revenue of $4.6 million.

The decrease was primarily driven by a lower number of NeuroStar systems sold in the quarter, lower blended NeuroStar capital system ASPs due to a higher mix of sales type leases during the quarter as well as lower other revenue related to fewer HP Coil upgrades sold.

In the quarter, the company sold 35 systems, down from 61 systems in the second quarter of 2019 as a result of the impact of COVID-19.

During the quarter, we saw our installed base increased by 13% to 1,122 systems, a net increase of 146 systems from the second quarter of 2019 and a net increase of 3 systems since March 31, 2020.

Turning to U.S. treatment session revenue.

U.S. treatment session revenue was $6.5 million for the second quarter of 2020, a decrease of 40% over the prior year.

Average revenue per system was $5,850 during the second quarter of 2020 compared to $11,651 in the prior year quarter.

Both of these declines were driven by COVID-19-related practice shutdowns.

Gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 was 76.2% compared to second quarter 2019 gross margin of 74.8%.

The increase was primarily a result of a change in the product mix of revenues versus the prior year.

Operating expenses during the second quarter of 2020 were $14.3 million, a decrease of $4.7 million compared to $19 million in the second quarter of 2019.

The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to reduced sales and marketing expenses, including trade shows and advertising, travel expense and personnel costs.

On a sequential basis, operating expenses decreased $4.7 million from $19 million during the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the implementation of our cost saving initiatives.

Net loss for the second quarter of 2020 was $7.8 million or $0.41 per share as compared to second quarter 2019 net loss of $7.1 million or $0.39 per share.

EBITDA for the second quarter of 2020 was negative $6.2 million as compared to the second quarter of 2019 EBITDA of negative $5.9 million.

Moving to the balance sheet.

As noted earlier, we have put in a significant amount of effort aimed at ensuring that we have adequate capital resources and liquidity to support the business over both the near and long term.

As of June 30, cash and cash equivalents were $54 million.

We remain focused on conserving capital, and earlier this year, instituted a number of cost reduction initiatives.

We expect to realize the full impact of these cost reductions in the third and fourth quarters.

The company continues to project total operating expenses for the full year 2020 to be in the range of $58 million to $60 million.

Going forward, we continue to expect quarterly operating expenses to be in the range of $12 million to $14 million.

And at those levels, we believe that we are likely to achieve operating income breakeven that revenues between $18 million and $20 million per quarter.

Moving on to our outlook for the balance of the year.

We believe that April and May will be the worst-performing months of the year, causing the second quarter to be the worst-performing quarter of the year.

Looking forward, we expect to see modest sequential recovery in both the third and fourth quarters.

I would now like to hand the call back over to Keith.

 Thanks, Steve.

Before opening the lines for questioning, I'd like to outline the areas of the business that we will be focused on in the near term.

First is to drive awareness of TMS as a very safe, effective therapy for depression.

We plan to conduct market research to identify the proper target audience, the messaging that resonates with them and the most efficient way to communicate with them.

We currently have a significant number of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy systems in the field, and we will be focused on working with our customers to make all of these systems successful.

The second area of focus is our commercial organization.

The leadership team has adjusted the field sales team to drive treatment session volume and revenue per system.

Once the market data is collected, we can create the proper tools to arm our NPCs with what they need to help our accounts with educating depression sufferers on the benefits of TMS to help convert them to patients.

This is a process that will take some time to deploy, but we are confident that we can be a valuable partner with our accounts to make them successful and help their patients.

In my prior experience in the aesthetics space, it was not too long ago we would walk into a practice where the physicians had little to no experience generating patient demand and were not actively driving new patient volume.

We were able to drastically change that through coaching and demand generation.

We believe that the same can be done with the psychiatric community.

With the power of social and digital marketing as a tool for both driving awareness and generating demand, we can partner with these practices to build a thriving business, treating patients and supporting their growth.

When we achieve this growth, it will be a catalyst to drive additional system sales.

Lastly, we are accelerating our indication expansion efforts in an effective and efficient manner.

We have long believed that the NeuroStar platform can and should have a much broader applicability within the treatment of psychiatric disorders.

As such, we will be evaluating our go-forward strategy to make sure that we can progress through the regulatory process more efficiently and bring new indications to the market sooner.

I'm very excited about what the future holds for Neuronetics.

Throughout the pandemic, we have put into place a highly proactive strategic set of initiatives that put us in a position of strength that will set us up for success as the world continues to reopen.

Building on that foundation, we believe that by executing our marketing plan, coupled with our proven technological advantages, robust clinical evidence and future additional indications, we will continue to expand our leadership position in the field of TMS and have a greater number of patients achieve relief from debilitating mental illness over the near, medium and long-term.

With that, I would like to open the line for questions.

 Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us.

I will provide an overview of the third quarter performance and then discuss the progress we made on our near-term focus areas.

Steve will then give our third quarter results, and I will conclude with our thoughts on the balance of 2020 before turning to questions and answers.

Starting with the review of the third quarter.

Total revenue was $12.4 million, up 28% sequentially over the second quarter of 2020, driven by growth in both system sales and treatment session revenue.

Although there was year-over-year decline in revenue due to the ongoing impact of COVID, which continued to affect both capital equipment sales and utilization in the field, we are pleased with our performance as we have begun to see a meaningful recovery in the business.

On the capital equipment side, U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenue grew by 11% over the second quarter of 2020.

With restrictions being eased in the third quarter and our virtual marketing and training efforts starting to pay off, our BDMs began to successfully get back into the field to prospect accounts.

We are particularly encouraged with the mix of systems sold between TMS-only providers and the traditional psychiatrist office is similar to our historical levels, indicating an increasingly favorable capital sales environment.

We anticipate that capital sales will continue to rebound, albeit at a slower rate than we are experiencing with the treatment sessions.

Total U.S. treatment session revenue was up 39% sequentially over the second quarter of 2020 and was down just 11% over the third quarter of 2019.

We are encouraged by this performance, knowing that approximately 10% of our customers' offices are still not seeing patients in person, but the 90% that are open and starting to see utilization approach pre-COVID levels.

Turning to our operational update.

On our last call, I laid out our near-term focus areas.

As a reminder, they are: first, driving awareness of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy as a safe, effective nondrug therapy for depression; second, putting a focus on driving treatment session revenue by optimizing our commercial organization; and third, developing our indication expansion strategy.

As it relates to driving awareness of those psychiatrists who currently utilize NeuroStar Advanced Therapy, the results and feedback are overwhelmingly positive.

We are learning during our assessment of the market that awareness of transcranial magnetic stimulation generally and NeuroStar Advanced Therapy specifically for the treatment of MDD is very low, both on the patient and psychiatrist side.

This points to a significant opportunity to raise awareness of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy.

There are over 26,000 psychiatrist practices in the United States and just 800 have a NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System in their office.

The market remains underserved and we will continue to work to penetrate it.

Shifting to optimizing our commercial organization.

In October, we announced Sara Grubbs as our Vice President of Sales.

In my 30 years of managing sales teams, I rank Sara as one of the top sales strategists and tacticians I've had the pleasure to work with.

She has developed extensive expertise commercializing medical devices similar to the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy that involve an ongoing sale of consumables and world-class customer support.

In particular, while at Zeltiq, she spent time developing and implementing the strategy on both capital and consumable portions of the business before stepping up to run the company's sales strategy for one of the largest U.S. regions.

We are excited to have her onboard and believe she is the right person to lead the reformulation of our sales strategy to drive treatment session revenue.

We are focused on expanding our base of clinical evidence and developing our indication expansion strategy.

In addition to bolstering our commercial leadership, we added other talent aimed at leveraging the huge amount of data available to us, including in the large repository of treatment data within our TrakStar cloud management tool.

With over 80% of our treatment sessions captured on the cloud, we have a significant amount of data that is being analyzed to help inform and support our strategy around patient marketing, payer reimbursement and regulatory pathways.

In October, clinical data was published in the Journal of Affective Disorders, suggesting that NeuroStar Advanced Therapy could be evaluated as a first-line treatment for MDD.

The authors analyzed 2 sample sets from our TrakStar registry, which included more than 5,000 patients across 103 practices, evaluating clinical outcomes data for the treatment with NeuroStar.

The author stated that research further validates the efficacy results shown in a prior naturalistic study, which showed a 58% response rate and a 37% remission rate.

These results are especially intriguing, considering similar metrics for antidepressant drugs, which, on a whole, have a response rate of 47% and a remission rate of 27% according to the STAR*D data for patients undergoing their first drug therapy.

The data continues to demonstrate that NeuroStar Advanced Therapy is a safe and effective treatment for those with depression who have not benefited from antidepressant medications.

And importantly, provide physicians with the scientific evidence needed to optimize the treatment of patients with depression.

According to the lead author of the study, Dr. Harold Sackeim, the NeuroStar's strong efficacy and the low side effects and medical risk profile suggests that TMS be evaluated as a first-line treatment for MDD.

Given that approximately half of the payers who reimburse for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy still require patients to fail 4 courses of drugs before being approved for treatment, the continued collection and publication of data showing the benefits of our therapy is critical.

During this year's Clinical TMS Society event, in September, Dr. Scott Aaronson presented a webinar on his pilot study on the treatment of bipolar depression, utilizing NeuroStar Advanced Therapy.

His presentation reviewed data from a 2-center open-label prospective trial.

He concluded that bipolar depression is most likely an excellent target for the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy.

With so few treatments available for the management of bipolar depression, making NeuroStar Advanced Therapy a nondrug treatment option, could be groundbreaking.

Overall, we are pleased with our performance during the third quarter.

We saw a strong sequential recovery in the business, both in terms of system sales and treatment session volumes.

We also have generated some significant momentum internally with the bolstering of our leadership team and the continued development of our industry-leading clinical data.

I'm very proud of how the entire organization has adapted to the uncertainty of COVID as well as a change in management.

I continue to be energized by the enthusiasm I am seeing out of the team every day.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.

 Thank you, Keith.

Total revenue for the quarter was $12.4 million, up 28% on a sequential basis over the second quarter of 2020.

Compared to the prior year, third quarter revenue was down 22%, primarily as a result of COVID-19, related governmental responses and resulting economic turmoil, which persisted throughout the quarter.

U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenue was $2.5 million, up 9% on a sequential basis over the second quarter of 2020.

Compared to the prior year, third quarter U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenue was down 45%, primarily driven by a lower number of NeuroStar systems sold during the quarter.

In the quarter, the company sold 39 systems, down from 68 in the third quarter of 2019 as a result of the impact of COVID-19.

During the quarter, we saw our installed base increase by 11% over the prior year quarter to 1,143 systems, a net increase of 111 systems from the third quarter of 2019 and a net increase of 21 systems since June 30, 2020.

U.S. treatment session revenue was $9.1 million, up 39% on a sequential basis over the second quarter of 2020.

Compared to the prior year, U.S. treatment session revenue was only down 11%.

The average revenue per system was approximately $8,100 during the third quarter of 2020 compared to approximately $10,500 in the prior year quarter.

Both of these declines were driven by psychiatrists temporarily shifting to telemedicine.

Gross margin for the third quarter of 2020 was 78.7% compared to the third quarter 2019 gross margin of 73.8%.

This significant increase was due to a higher mix of treatment session revenue as well as a reduction in field service costs during the quarter.

Operating expenses during the quarter were $12.2 million, a decrease of $5.9 million or 33% compared to the third quarter of 2019.

The decrease was primarily due to reduced sales and marketing expenses as well as reduced research and development costs.

On a sequential basis, operating expenses decreased $2.1 million from the second quarter of 2020 as a result of the full realization of our cost-saving initiatives implemented in April.

Net loss for the third quarter of 2020 was $3.4 million or $0.18 per share as compared to a net loss of $6.9 million or $0.37 per share during the third quarter of 2019.

EBITDA for the third quarter of 2020 was negative $2.2 million as compared to negative $5.6 million for the third quarter of 2019.

Moving to the balance sheet.

Throughout much of this year, we focused on having adequate capital resources and liquidity to support the business over both the near and long term.

As of September 30, cash and cash equivalents were $50.7 million.

We continue to believe that cash on hand provides us the capital necessary to get to breakeven.

Now turning to guidance.

For the fourth quarter of 2020, we expect revenue in the range of $13 million to $13.5 million as we continue to expect to see sequential improvement in the business during the quarter.

The company continues to project total 2020 operating expenses for the full year to be in the range of $59 million to $61 million.

I would now like to turn the call back over to Keith.

 Thanks, Steve.

Moving to our thoughts on the balance of 2020 as well as 2021.

Since joining the company in July, we have made a lot of progress throughout the organization.

There is still heavy lifting to be done around the development and implementation of our commercial strategy, but we have put the right people and process in place to drive the strategy forward.

As mentioned on our last call, we have engaged a market research firm to identify the proper target audience, the messaging that resonates with them and the most efficient way to communicate with them.

Ultimately, our goal is to arm our NPCs with the tools and business development strategies to help customers drive increased patient volume and educate patients on the benefit of the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy as a safe, effective, nondrug therapy for the treatment of MDD.

We will have results of the study in late Q4 and look forward to providing an update on the results on our fourth quarter call.

In addition to developing the new communication strategy, we are currently in the process of optimizing our sales organization.

We will be making decisions around the structure of our sales force, which relates specifically to the ratio of BDMs to NPCs as well as decisions around the expansion of the sales force more broadly.

Specifically, we are planning to redefine our BDM territories to better optimize the volume of potential customers' accounts each BDM can cover.

We will also align the NPC territories to allow them to have more meaningful impact in driving patient volumes into existing customers.

These decisions will be completed shortly, and we expect to selectively hire new BDMs and NPCs during the fourth quarter with the goal of having those new reps onboard and trained ahead of our national sales kickoff meeting during the fourth week of January 2021.

Outside of our commercial organization, we have momentum building in other areas, such as reimbursement, clinical data development and indication expansion, which we believe will act as tailwinds for the business in the coming quarters.

From that perspective, while we continue to expect solid execution in the fourth quarter and during the first half of 2021, we believe that we will start to see more material positive inflections towards the back half of 2021.

We would look forward to providing more robust overview of our strategy for 2021 on our fourth quarter call.

I'd like to take a moment and acknowledge the tremendous mental strain that this ongoing pandemic has caused across the U.S.

There has been a significant disruption within almost every facet of our lives.

In an article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, or JAMA, in October, it was stated that in a June 2020 survey of over 5,400 adults, it was found that 40.9% of the respondents reported at least 1 adverse mental or behavioral health condition, which included depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress and substance abuse.

These reported rates were 3 to 4x higher than last year.

The need for treatment options to help those suffering from psychiatric disorders has never been greater, and we will continue to work diligently to ensure that as many patients as possible can get relief with NeuroStar Advanced Therapy.

With the quarter under my belt at the organization, I am very excited about the future of Neuronetics.

We are in a very unique position.

We are the market leader in an industry that is largely underpenetrated.

We have a large and growing set of clinical data pointing to the efficacy of the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy, and we have a highly experienced team throughout the organization with a proven track record.

On top of all that, in early learnings from our market research, we have found that few psychiatrists or patients are aware of transcranial magnetic stimulation or NeuroStar Advanced Therapy as a treatment option for depression.

Taken all together, we have a massive opportunity in front of us to bring relief to a significant population of patients who are struggling with drug-resistant depression and potentially other psychiatric disorders.

With that, I'd like to open the line for questions.

 Thank you, Amy, and good morning to everyone.

First, our thoughts are with those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we are grateful to all the health care workers and those that support them for their selfless efforts to support patients during this challenging time.

It is important to note that the safety of patients, health care professionals and our employees remains our top priority during these trying times.

On the call this morning, Alison and Kate, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Medical Officer and Head of R&amp;D, respectively, will discuss one of the most exciting and compelling opportunities I've had the privilege to be part of in my nearly 40 years in the biopharmaceutical industry: the initiation of the COVID-19 clinical program utilizing our product candidate, KB109.

The aim of the clinical program is to determine if this MMT, KB109, can alter the course of the disease in a newly diagnosed mild to moderate cohort of patients infected.

(technical difficulty)
 KB109, specifically, are well suited to this endeavor.

Product platform and KB 109 specifically, are well suited for this endeavor.

We are thrilled to be part of a worldwide effort to better understand and moderate the course of this dev data in the fourth quarter of this year, heralds a broader move to explore the impact of various MMTs on diseases involving immune and inflammatory pathways.

Another product candidate from our library, KB295, will be studied in a clinical trial of ulcerative colitis.

We expect data from that clinical trial in mid-2021.

This new set of strategic priorities adds to our work in UCD and hepatic encephalopathy with KB195 and KB174, respectively.

Now over to Alison for more details on the rationale and study design for these exciting new clinical trials.

Alison?

 Thanks, Mike.

COVID-19 is
 (technical difficulty)
 unprecedented global impact on health and health care facilities.

We continue to adapt our work to help prioritize the safety of employees, patients and clinical staff, and we understand the need for study sites to limit certain activities in light of the ongoing pandemic.

We are fortunate with our product platform and efficient discovery and development that Kaleido has both the opportunity and flexibility in responding to these developments.

And in fact, we're uniquely positioned to advance the number of pipeline programs, for which we expect to deliver data over the next 18 months.

The burden of COVID-19 pandemic is vast, and there remains an opportunity for interventional studies in patients with mild to moderate disease, a population which represents the majority of those infected.

There is also a need for a convenient, orally administered, well-tolerated product that has the potential to augment the patient's own immune system to fight the immune-mediated pathology of this disease and avoid more serious complications of the infection and the need for hospitalization.

We are initiating 2 non-IND controlled clinical studies of our MMT, KB109, that is designed to evaluate the effects of supportive self-care plus KB109 compared to supportive self-care alone in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 infection who are not hospitalized.

The program includes both a multicenter study of approximately 350 patients and a second study of approximately 50 patients, which will also evaluate the composition and metabolites of patients' microbiome.

In both studies, patients will be randomized to either receive supportive self-care, the control group, or supportive self-care plus KB109 for 2 weeks, and then will be followed for 3 weeks.

These studies will include assessments of clinical outcomes, health care utilization and biomarkers of the inflammatory response that may also help inform the potential of KB109 in other viral respiratory and bacterial infection.

We look forward to initial top line results from the multicenter study in Q4 of this year.

KB109 highlights the flexibility of our MMT platform.

MMTs like KB109 are designed to drive the function and distribution of the microbiomes' existing microbes in order to decrease or increase the production of metabolites and to advantage or disadvantage certain bacteria in the microbiome community.

MMT candidates that targeted synthetic glycans that are orally administered have limited systemic exposure and are selectively metabolized by enzymes in the microbiota.

These characteristics of MMTs enable an efficient clinical development path, which allows us to move candidates rapidly from discovery into clinical studies under regulation supporting research with food.

Strong scientific rationale and data generated to date with KB109, paired with the flexibility of this path, has enabled us to move quickly into an area of high unmet medical need.

I will now turn the call over to Kate Knobil, our Chief Medical Officer and Head of R&amp;D, for additional details on the COVID-19 clinical studies and the scientific rationale behind this new program.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Katharine Knobil,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Chief Medical Officer and Head of Research &amp; Development   [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks, Alison.

We are delighted to be collaborating with the University of Massachusetts Medical School and Center for Microbiome Research on our COVID-19 program, along with a number of other clinical centers in the United States.

As you've just heard, the 2 studies will enroll approximately 400 outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, who will be randomized to either supportive self-care or supportive self-care plus KB109 orally for 2 weeks, followed by 3 weeks of follow-up.

In addition to assessing safety and tolerability, patients will monitor objective measures, such as temperature and oxygen levels and participate in telemedicine visits with clinicians.

We will also be collecting data on clinical outcomes, health care utilization and biomarkers of the inflammatory response that may help inform the potential of KB109 in other respiratory viral infections and, more broadly, on the impact of MMTs on the immune system.

The study of approximately 50 patients has a similar study design but will also evaluate changes in the composition and the metabolic output of the patient's gut microbiomes.

The data and scientific rationale for evaluating KB109 and COVID-19 are compelling.

This infection has been associated with activation of an inappropriate inflammatory cascade, which in some patients can cause an abnormally aggressive immune response that can lead to pneumonia and respiratory failure.

Increased short-chain fatty acids, which are created by fermentation of glycans by the gut microbiome, have been shown in preclinical models to influence immune pathways and mitigate immune pathology associated with severe respiratory viral infections, including reducing mortality from lethal influenza virus infection.

These studies have also demonstrated that short chain fatty acid producing taxa induce virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell and antibody responses involved in the reduction of the severity of viral infection, as well as influencing macrophage functionality to mitigate neutrophil-mediated tissue damage.

There are also human data to support the role of short-chain fatty acids in reducing the impact of viral infections.

In patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplants who have contracted respiratory viral infection, including coronavirus, the presence of short-chain fatty acid producing taxa has been associated with the significantly reduced risk of progression to lower respiratory tract infections, which can have significant morbidity in this patient population.

MMTs are novel glycans that are synthesized to enable precise modulation of the taxonomic composition of the gut microbiome, as well as its metabolic output.

Specifically, MMTs promote a beneficial short-chain fatty acid profile in the gut and promote the growth of taxa that has the potential to support the host's ability to mount an appropriate immune and inflammatory response, while also preventing an overaggressive hyperinflammatory state, up to and including cytokine storm.

KB109 was selected for evaluation in the COVID-19 clinical program based on its demonstrated ability ex vivo to increase the production of short-chain fatty acids, as well as to promote commensals while reducing pathogenic bacteria.

We're looking forward to the initial top line data from this important program in the fourth quarter of this year.

Alison, back over to you.

 Thanks, Kate.

With the progress we've had in KB109 resources on the COVID-19 program, Kaleido has elected to pose the Vitora clinical study of KB109 in patients colonized with multidrug-resistant pathogens.

We are evaluating next steps for our pathogen program, including a future potential clinical study in a patient population at high risk of infection, such as in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

Beyond KB109, we are expanding our efforts with our immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases to further understand the potential application of our MMT platform.

We plan to initiate a clinical study evaluating a new MMT candidate, KB295, in approximately 30 patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis or UC.

UC is linked to microbiome dysbiosis and microbiome restoration has been shown to lead to clinical remission in patients.

Short-chain fatty acids are consistently observed as down-regulated in UC patients.

Clinical studies administering inulin-glycans have demonstrated an improvement in active UC associated with an increase in short-chain fatty acids.

KB295 has shown an ability to increase production of short-chain fatty acids while also reducing the presence of inflammatory bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae also linked to UC.

Patients in this single-site study will be evaluated over 56 days of treatment and 14 days of follow-up.

We will be looking at safety and tolerability as well as impacts on the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index.

Exploratory endpoints include changes in microbiome taxa, short-chain fatty acids levels in stool and serological biomarkers of inflammation.

We've been working closely with the European sites of this study and incorporating remote monitoring into the design.

And along with the recent IRB approval for the protocol, we are confident we will have top line results in the middle of 2021.

Turning now to KB195, which is currently being evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial called UNLOCKED, in patients with urea cycle disorders who are inadequately controlled on standard of care.

Given the limitations on patient visits and the impact of COVID-19 on new patient enrollment, we now anticipate the data from this study will most likely be available in the second half of 2021.

More than 20 sites are currently activated in 8 countries, and we have submitted an amendment to expand the eligibility age criteria for enrollment of patients aged 12 instead of previously 18 and up to the age of 70 instead of previously 65.

With respect to our KB174 program in hepatic encephalopathy, we are ready to initiate the next clinical study in patients with the disease.

However, the study initiation is dependent on partnering the program and the resolution of COVID-19 impact at trial sites.

In addition to our clinical programs, we have a number of preclinical programs where we expect to have clinical-ready lead MMTs identified in 2021.

This will position us well for either potential partnerships or to begin new clinical program.

With our immuno-oncology program, our goal is to identify MMT candidate that stimulate the targeted therapeutic response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced preclinical models.

We are collaborating with Gustave Roussy, a leading center for oncology immunotherapy in Europe, and we anticipate the selection of lead compounds based on data from our preclinical work in Q4 of this year.

We also plan to have preclinical data from validated models of additional immune-mediated diseases that will identify new clinical-ready lead MMT candidates in the first half of 2021.

And we continue preclinical work for our cardio-metabolic and liver disease program are on track for results from validated models in Q4 of 2020.

Before we take questions, I want to mention that we ended the first quarter with $53.8 million cash on hand, and we continue to manage our operating expenses in line with our pipeline priorities.

And as a result, we've extended our cash runway further into the first quarter of 2021.

The next 18 months are very important for Kaleido as we continue to translate the promise of the microbiome into solutions for patients.

We look forward to key upcoming data milestones, including clinical results from our larger COVID-19 study in Q4; results from our KB295 study in UC in mid-2021; and our Phase II clinical results from our KB195 study in UCD in the second half of next year.

Now I'd like the operator to open up the call for your questions.
