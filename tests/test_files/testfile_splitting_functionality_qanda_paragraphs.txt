Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions)
 Our first question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [2]

Either Chris or Peter, just in looking at the guidance for the year, obviously, really good performance during Q3. Guidance coming up a little bit for Q4 here -- for the full year, sorry, Q4 not changing much, an easier comp that you just saw here in Q3 -- here in Q4

So just wanted to make sure there is not anything that we're missing from a system placement perspective? A bigger bulk purchase in Q3? Or anything along those lines that you're trying to signal here in Q4 that may weigh a little bit on the top line, even though it's still really good expected top line growth?

Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP &amp; CFO   [3]

Yes, thanks, Matt. This is Peter. I'll let Chris answer with some color commentary, so just to put closure to first part of your question, there is nothing unusual or any bulks or nuances that would influence that guidance one way or the other. So I'll let Chris add some more commentary around Q4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [4]

Yes. Matt, thanks for asking that question. If you look at Q4, Q4 is one of our lowest quarterly growth rates year-over-year for treatment sessions. Typically, what happens in Q4 is NeuroStar System sales are at the highest of the year. And we're expecting terrific NeuroStar System sales in Q4

Although we increased our CTCs, the increase in Q4 system sales provides a headwind to a pull-through efforts due to the higher number of installs and trainings required. They're out there. We're going to have to -- with the number systems expected in Q4, this will outstrip the CTC team and the CTC team will be involved in installs. This happened again last year as well

So there is a -- and there's also a couple of points of growth here. In Q4, 2017, we benefited from the launch of the upgraded coil, and that's not going to occur this year. But that's a couple of points of growth there as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [5]

Okay. Very fair. And then -- and obviously, the capital number was extremely strong this quarter. Can you just deconstruct a little bit the performance among some of your more established reps versus some of the newer ones?
 Because as I look at the numbers, versus what you did last year, there is -- I think there is an opportunity for the entire group to go up pretty meaningfully from a productivity per quarter perspective not -- they're not trending very well right now. But is that a fair assessment? Or just again, can you just kind of deconstruct the older reps versus the ones that you recently brought on board?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [6]

Yes, yes. So good question. So our model, the way we think about it is, as we add reps and as they mature, they become more productive. And that typically occurs somewhere between 12 and 18 months they hit their stride and their performance is higher

And so when you look at our hiring, we did a fair bit of hiring in the fourth quarter of last year, and then we paced it early part of this year. On a weighted average Matt, we actually have slightly less experienced reps in Q4 of this year than we actually did in Q4 of last year

So -- and then there is generally not a cliffing or a binary event that takes place, it's gradual over time. So the productivity on a quarter-over-quarter basis is actually lower. But our full-time equivalents are up almost 80-plus percent versus this time last year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [7]

Got it. And last one for me. And I know it's really early, but I'm just a little bit curious about the impact of the CTCs on the CPCs? Anything you can provide just a little bit of color, again, I get it's early as far as the impact that those folks are having on your treatment session business

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [8]

Yes. So it's difficult, Matt. I mean, the way to solve for that empirically is that we don't do any other activities in the field like BDM expansion, the marketing and soft target and high-value targets, just to track kind of what happens with those CTCs, that's a difficult exercise and not in the best interest of the business

I think more intuitively, this time last year the CPCs were doing all the training. This year, we have 11 full-time bodies doing all of the training. And as I mentioned in the last call, that gave us really good leverage in Q1, Q2 and Q3. But that leverage starts to wane over the quarters. And as we move into Q4, there is a big step-up here in system sales

We have this 44-man army -- men and women army out there, who are really maturing, and we're expecting big things from them in Q4. So I think they'll outstrip that leverage fortunately, unfortunately in Q4. And then, we'll look to add more CTCs and CPCs here in the future

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [9]

Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [10]

So first off, I was hoping to focus a little bit more on the utilization for active system, which for us by our math might even approach double-digit growth, which is quite strong. So first, can you comment whether it reached double-digit growth?
 And then second, maybe walk us through what could drive that as we go forward into Q4 and into 2019, especially, since it sounds like you're going to do a little bit more DTC study in Q4?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [11]

Right. So we're really excited about the total NeuroStar treatment session revenue growth. I mean this was a big step up and we've managed to improve quarter-over-quarter on that

And then the other thing is, is we're selling a lot more systems, right? So -- and those systems -- when we sell those systems, they don't really attribute to utilization very much in their first couple quarters

So when you think about our NeuroStar treatment session utilization growing just north of 8% year-over-year with a 20% increase in the number of systems over prior year, I mean, that typically is dilutive to system utilization. The fact that we can post high single-digit growth on a per unit basis, we're pretty proud of that right now

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [12]

Okay. So maybe just to key-in further kind of on various reasons for that and kind of the spending on the DTC. So if you go on Google trends and you start to see all the hits coming up on NeuroStar, or on iSpot.tv you can see the amount of ads that are going out on you guys whether it's you or whether it's some of the local ads that are going around out there to your depression tour

But can you walk us through kind of the revenue return per dollars spent? How quickly we should see a return on that spending? And then whether or not you guys can target your ads better now that you have a little bit more experience with it as well?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [13]

Yes -- no, thanks, Margaret. Yes, so we qualified the first DTC campaign as a beta. And we learned a fair bit. We learned a couple things as it relates to the channels in which we were going to extend through meaning actually the TV channels. And so we've actually modified this campaign based on those learnings. We're actually going to fewer shows that are more closely targeted actually to depression audience. We can get some research. We have some research now, where people with depression tend to watch

The second thing is, is operationally what we're doing this time is we found out that if a provider doesn't call back through our website they can request an appointment or schedule an appointment or click a call. And if they don't call back that patient immediately they lose that patient. So we've actually worked with our providers leading into this round of DTC to tighten up that feedback loop

So those are the things that we're doing differently. I would call this a beta-plus program, and we're still experimenting. We are -- we do know that we are breaking all of our records already right now in web sessions, physician-locator searches, and booking appointments at this stage of the campaign versus last year

And the challenge there is then being able to track those patients, getting to the practice, and then once they get to the practice, turning them into treatment sessions. So we're tightening that feedback loop on this next round. And we'll be able to understand going forward a little better what that return on investment is

But I think, we've qualified and quantified this before, this is not millions of dollars of spends, we're learning as it relates to what the return on investment is here. But clearly, it did help us, I mean, the types of numbers that we're seeing here in the third quarter and in the back half of the second quarter are up, and this is just one reason why

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [14]

If you guys go to the next stage it sounds like you did get utilization growth right up. And then just kind of last question on Japan. I think you guys have a number of NeuroStar systems already in Japan. And I think you referenced 150 physicians that are showing up to some of the training sessions

So are those folks that already have a system? And then once you do get reimbursement, should we assume a pretty quick ramp given the installed-base that is already out there?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [15]

Oh, yes, thanks. So really there are no active commercial units in Japan currently. And the only thing that's in our revenue line right now is an amortized milestone payment for the upfront milestone that we got from Teijin, when we signed the contract

So what you're seeing -- so what's going on is the JSPN called -- has an annual meeting, 2 meetings a year where they train on the basic science of TMS. And in June, they held their meeting and in 72 hours of notice of the meeting, the meeting was full. And they announced a couple weeks ago that they're doing a course again in January, and within 2 days the meeting was full. So these are people that don't have systems, that are really interested in learning more about the science

And then what happens is our partner, Teijin, then takes about 20 of those providers every month and brings them to their facility and goes through the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System in detail with them, so they're familiar with the technology

And then what they are also working on right now is capital equipment budgets in 2019. So they're setting the stage with these providers roughly somewhere between 200 and 300 before capital equipment budgets are due, they'll have talked to and discussed the opportunity to put a NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System into their facility

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [16]

And our next question comes from Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jason Richard Mills,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD of Research &amp; Analyst   [17]

Congratulations on a good quarter. I was going to start somewhere else Chris, but the Japan discussion, I wanted to pull on that thread little bit more, it sounds interesting. So can you frame the Japanese opportunity for us again, relative to the U.S. opportunity? Just as you look at the geographical makeup of Japan, the patient makeup of Japan relative to the U.S., just as using the U.S. as a guide?
 And just sort of give us some sort of a qualitative assessment of how Japan may play out next year? Because I don't think many of us have much in the way of revenue and the stock probably doesn't trade on Japan next year, but if you're doing well in the U.S., and you get a kicker in Japan, it certainly will make a difference. So maybe you level set us with Japan and how that rolls out in the first year?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [18]

Sure, Jason. Yes, thanks for the question. Right. So when we think about the market opportunity, we think about the market opportunity in the serviceable addressable market to be about 1/3 of what it is in the U.S. The serviceable addressable market in the U.S. is about $3 billion. The serviceable addressable market in Japan is about $1 billion

The difference in Japan is, they actually have a much higher concentration of psychiatric-only hospitals, local community-based hospitals. And a lot of their moderate to severe MDD patients are actually admitted to inpatient facilities. And they're not treated on an outpatient basis

So it's a little bit slightly different model. That's why we picked our partner Teijin Pharma, because they have really good relationships within the inpatient hospitals throughout Japan, and these psychiatric hospitals throughout Japan. So that's why we picked that partner

We have not -- giving any guidance as it relates to revenues for Japan. We will provide that in the -- during our first quarter call next year. By that time, we'll better understand not just if we got reimbursement, what that reimbursement rate is, because that will certainly have some impact on the first year and the following year revenues

The other thing -- the only other thing I'd say is that the awareness in Japan is on TMS is actually much higher than where the company started when the company got their approval in 2009. And there is quite a bit good understanding of our success here in the States. And so I view that adoption curve to potentially be better sooner, faster, steeper in Japan early versus the adoption current that we had when we first rolled out the product here

And remember, the other thing is, is that we'll have national reimbursement. So everyone will be covered come March 1, if everything goes through this year. Everyone will be covered March 1. So we don't have to worry about converting the max in 95 other private payors. We won't have that barrier of entry in our way

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jason Richard Mills,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD of Research &amp; Analyst   [19]

Got it. That's helpful. And just a follow-up on this and then one for the U.S. Maybe give us a sense for the competitive landscape in Japan as you see it over the next couple of years? You're doing fine here and there's a few smaller competitors that we get questions on, but clearly, in the United States here, you're doing just fine. In Japan, what's that look like?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [20]

Yes. So Japan -- we know that one of our competitors applied several years ago for approval. And our understanding was that they didn't accept their clinical data. But that was many years ago. We understand that at least one of our competitors has applied for approval. And it remains to be seen what MHLW will require, as it relates to the clinical data

That said, we feel like we've got a head start for sure, I mean, we're going to be the only approved product in Japan to start. And then, others will have to get their product approved during MHLW process. So the competitive landscape will be a little bit less competitive than in this year in the U.S

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jason Richard Mills,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD of Research &amp; Analyst   [21]

Okay. And then just lastly for me in the United States, Chris, can you give us a sense for -- you placed more NeuroStar Systems than we were modeling this quarter, which is good. And I'm just curious the makeup of those new system placements, specifically, into which they are going?
 Maybe talk a little bit about the number of brand-new customers that you brought on board this quarter? How that's trending? Folks that are adding a second or a third system? And what that might mean to utilization? Just any context you can give with respect to the complexion of customers in the quarter?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [22]

Sure, Jason. So we've seen over the last couple quarters more multisystem initial purchases from first-time customers. And most of our purchases in any given quarter are from first-time customers. And so -- and then, we are seeing the number of systems per location increase slightly from where we were at the beginning of the year. So we are seeing some follow-on in our existing customer base, and we are seeing more multisystem purchases upfront

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [23]

And I'm showing no further question at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Chris Thatcher for any further remarks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [24]

Thanks again, for joining us today. And we look forward to updating you on our progress on our next call

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [25]

Ladies and gentleman, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [2]

First off, just wanted to follow up on the inputs to guidance, kind of what gets you to the low end, the high end? It seems like you are going to add more sales reps, more BDMs than originally thought, and the guidance appears relatively in line. So are you assuming maybe the sales rep productivity goes down? Or just walk us through those

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP of Finance &amp; CFO   [3]

Yes. I assume, Margaret, before we answer your -- this is Peter. Good morning. I assume you're referring to the full-year 2019 guidance?

Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [4]

Correct

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP of Finance &amp; CFO   [5]

Sure. I mean, just to remind you, we set our guidance based off of the model, right? And it's worked well for us. You've been following us for a while. The number of BDMs are the key driver to that model, and we put them in there at flat productivity. I was always hoping for better, but we put them in there at flat productivity. We use their -- we use historical utilization rates for the utilization based on the prior year [capacity], which is the largest [one] as well as the new installs for 2019. We assume a little bit of a decline in ASP on the treatment sessions at 3% to 5%, and as Chris indicated in his prepared remarks, there's no revenue up for Japan, right? So that's how we set up the guidance for the full year. And you're right, we do have a few additional BDMs in the plan with the total of 15 expected up for 2019. Those are staged through the year, and we put them into the model and it generated the guidance which we guided you to today

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [6]

Okay. So if we kind of look at that BDMs and the fact that they outperformed for 2018 on the number of system sales, is that the historical reps versus the new reps that are coming online? And then can you speak anything to the quality of reps you're bringing on and the advertising dollars you're spending, any kind of clarity on the ROI there?

Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP of Finance &amp; CFO   [7]

Yes. I'll take the first part, and maybe we can tag team with Chris, parts two and three. So what we have in there for the BDMs, Margaret, are they did. You're right. They slightly overperformed our expectations. And if you remember, a BDM is considered a full BDM in month 13. So there's some blending there. But if you take the blended average of the seasoned reps versus the new reps, and I think we're a little skewed right now towards the unseasoned rep, which would lower the blended rate. But what we did is we did not take into some of that overachievement in 2019 -- into our 2019 guidance. We view as kind of where we have always been, just assuming for conservative -- just take that's their productivity for the BDMs. I hope that answers the first part of your question. And then obviously, we take ASP is a big driver. If you recall, we guided to at least a few kind of low-single digits price deterioration on the capital piece, and we are pleasantly surprised. We came up at less than 1% decline. So we did build in some decline in ASP into our guidance for 2019, again, in the low-single digits, knowing that we achieved less than 1% price decline and have been 7 or 8 quarters straight of kind of record ASPs on the NeuroStars

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [8]

Okay, yes. And that's helpful. Then just to follow up on the advertising ROI. If you can give us a sense of what that was in 2018, expectations for spend into 2019, knowing that you guys are trialing the steps, but it seems like you referenced maybe an ability to improve the psychiatrist customer conversion rate? So ways that you could potentially do that as well would be helpful

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [9]

Yes. Sure. So good morning, Margaret. So this is really a beta that we're running, and I qualify it as a test and retest, and we're still in the learning process here. And we haven't and we don't plan to share the level of detail as it relates to the expense, but it's incorporated in our OpEx guidance as well. But I can give you a little bit better sense. So the first metric we look at is just the basic increase in traffic, and it is -- they either increase significantly or the cost -- the number -- the cost is then reduced each time we've done this to get patients to come to our website. And more importantly, we look at the leads generation, which is the physician locator searches, appointments booked online and click to call. And from our side of the funnel, and this is our side of funnel, which we feel we are optimizing each time we've done this, but we still have some work to do in converting these leads into treated patients once they go to practice, and what we've learned this most recent time around, is we found that practices that follow up quickly on patients, and remember, these patients are depressed, have a much higher conversion rate, and we're exploring opportunities to capitalize on this finding. And we'll keep you abreast of how that evolves. But we'll start talking about ROIs when we start, what I would say, investing significantly on this. And at this point, I would qualify what we're doing as a beta

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP of Finance &amp; CFO   [10]

And then there was one other -- to you, Chris, the second part of Margaret's original question was just on the quality of the reps. And Chris can certainly take it. From where I sit, Margaret, as we put it into the model, as we shared with you before, we're at or ahead of our hiring schedule. We were all of 2018, we are attracting kind of President's Club Winners from a lot of the larger medical device companies, where it's a lot easier to recruit when you're growing 31% have a unique technology out there. So we found that the quality of the rep and our ability to attract that talent has exceeded our expectations. So we're confident that we could fill the 15 reps, again, in 2019 at or ahead of schedule because we've done it for the last 2 years. I don't know, Chris, if you have any more to add

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [11]

And our next question comes from Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Louis Turkaly,  JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [12]

I know you mentioned some of the meetings that you guys were at in February and it looks like the first one in Vancouver that there was a discussion of the contact sensing. And I think that's sort of one of the bigger differentiators of your technology. You mentioned a head-to-head study. So I was just curious if you'd talk to us about how big a differentiator that is? And what were the outcomes of that study?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [13]

Yes. Good morning, Dave. I think what you're referring to is we did an even factors testing that showed that [it's in four styles that were] reproducible by a NeuroStar user than it is for one of the competitors to be more reproducible in placing their magnet. And at a high level -- and we haven't published this yet. We will publish it shortly. But at a high level, it shows that the NeuroStar is much more predictable and reproducible in finding the treatment location and having the magnet aligned, and it is relatively significant. The findings generally were in the high teens, around 15% of the NeuroStar users were more precise in finding the treatment location than one of our competitors. And then in the study, we actually crossed over treaters as well and the competitors were actually much more efficient in finding the treatment location time and time again in using our system. And we have several -- and you might recall, our product was actually designed for psychiatry and high throughput device, where these products are actually neurological products that were not designed for this. And I think that came out in this human factor study. And it did bring out kind of the benefits of NeuroStar and the way it's designed versus how the competitors' product is

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Louis Turkaly,  JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [14]

And two quick ones on the account base. So I think you mentioned that upgrades were a little lower in '18, but I imagine it's because most people have already decided to do so. So I guess what percent of your installed base do you think is upgraded to the faster regimen? And as a last one, you mentioned some of the ASP declined because of the high-volume accounts. So obviously, not a bad thing if you're getting a lot of volume from discounting a bit because the accounts are using it so often. I guess, any color on what percent of the installed base you kind of think is moving towards that high-volume area? Or is there today?

Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP of Finance &amp; CFO   [15]

Yes. So we think it's about half taking advantage of the upgrade, Dave. And keep in mind, too, that beginning in the second quarter of 2017, all the systems have the 19-minute treatment session. So each successive quarter as you get past that -- April of 2017, there'll be less upgrade revenue, right, because there are less folks taking advantage of it. So we've found that it's really good for customers that are trying to manage peak load. As you can imagine, a lot of folks would like to come in before work or start their day doing treatment or come in over lunch or end their day a little early. So there's that -- it helps alleviate that. So those customers that are generally trying to manage that and it's more cost-effective than buying a second system. So those are the folks that take advantage of the treatment session upgrade technology, right? And then you mentioned -- you were talking a little bit about treatment. I want to make sure I answer all your questions. Treatment session pricing, we've been pretty consistent, Chris and I have over the course of last few quarters, of telling folks, we expect kind of mid-single digits kind of 3% to 4%, 5% range of price breaks that we give customers and reminding folks out there that this is not a discount we do to drive sales at the end of the quarter or just for promotions on these treatment sessions. These are predetermined, we negotiate with the customer, and it's all part of this surrounding the customer and partnering with them, right? So we share in their success. As the volumes goes up, we give them price breaks. And as we've said, 3% to 5% -- and that's what volumes, Dave, growing in kind of the 23%, 24%, 25% range. When you see volumes kind of growing faster or system sales growing faster, then you could see getting above the 5% range. But we're comfortable guiding that, that's where we'll be 3% to 5% kind of price breaks will take hold again in 2019 versus 2018, and we'll come back and tell you the good news, right? It's really good news because we'll trade 1 point or a few basis points of ASP on a product that's growing 95% -- has 95 -- 90% to 95% margins for us that's growing and people are taking advantage of the technology

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [16]

And our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [17]

Just to start off with guidance to put a little bit of finer point on it. You've grown north of 25%-ish for the last 6 quarters. You're now guiding 18% to 22%. It implies a pretty meaningful deceleration in the back half of the year even though in Q1, here after toughest comp, you're still guiding very good top line growth. So I'm just wondering if there's something specifically that you're trying to call out in the back half that we need to pay attention to? Or if it's just a bit of management conservatism?

Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP of Finance &amp; CFO   [18]

Yes. So good morning, Matt. Thanks for the question. And I'll parrot kind of first what I told Margaret. We're basing full year guidance at 18% to 22%, right? And that's all the reasons I cited to Margaret a few minutes ago. We're using all kind of historical utilization rates, historical averages, productivity. We build in some price declines as I've answered in a couple of previous questions and that spits out a number, Matt, for full year guidance in that 20% range, right? So that's where we, as a management team, want to be comfortable giving that number. For the first quarter, right, given that we're 2 months into the quarter already, we have more visibility, right? So we have a lot more confidence in projecting a higher growth rate for the first quarter relative to the annual guidance. But the annual guidance is set based on all those predicates that I pointed out on the call, which is the addition of the BDMs, their flat productivity year-over-year, some modest price declines on the capital and 3% to 5% price breaks on the treatment sessions, with no increase in utilization. Obviously, we intend to a bit overachieve on those, and we'll come back to you as we go out through the year. And if we can point to something, a trend, then we'll adjust our guidance accordingly

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [19]

Okay. So you've built in quite a few leverage points then potentially, maybe if those would come through like they did in '18, there could be upside?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [20]

Let me put this together, Matt. We think about a lot of things. And so we think about the productivity of the business development managers. As we add more, could the productivity potentially decline? Could it stay the same? Could it slightly increase like it did this year? And we put that range in there, we make an assumption range on pricing, and we're making an assumption range on utilization. We consider the marketplace that we're in as well, and we put that all together and we try to be really thoughtful with it and give you a range where we feel comfortable that we're going to achieve within that range. So this is where we've come out. We've, I think, given a pretty good range for the first quarter. Our growth rate is strong coming off of Q4, and you can project from there, and we'll keep you updated quarter-to-quarter as we implement. In Q1, we'll give you an update on how we feel the rest of the year is going to go

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [21]

Okay. Fair enough. Can we talk a little bit about the -- you've added so many systems in the last -- especially in the back half of last year, but over the last couple of years. It's difficult to tease out the growth rates on the treatment side for some of your more tenured facilities. So when you look at the growth rate in treatment session revenue, I think it was up 23%. Can you talk a little bit about some of the more mature centers and how they're trending as far as their growth rates go? I mean, are they growing well ahead of what you expected? Or any just kind of qualitative commentary there would be helpful

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP of Finance &amp; CFO   [22]

Yes. I'll start, Matt, and I'll let Chris weigh in if he needs to. If you look at the historical base, it's roughly two patients a day, right? And obviously, the new HVT strategy, once they get up and running, have 3x more potential right, round numbers. As that we just talked about, we're not factoring in that potential into our guidance, but certainly, the newer accounts are achieving ahead at a much higher level or will be at a much higher level over time, and we're starting to see some of the fruits of that strategy which is -- we're still, believe it or not, still kind of in the early innings with respect to that strategy. So we're comfortable that those accounts have a much higher potential, but we're -- we haven't given you the granularity around that just yet

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [23]

Okay. Fair enough. And the last one for me. Just on the OpEx side, I mean the guide for the year was a little bit -- was more than we were modeling. And I think I get it. I think it's more on the personnel side with the BDMs, and CTCs, CPCs, et cetera. So how do we think about those investments? Is it fair to say '19 is a personnel kind of driven year above what we may have expected? And then into '20, could be more on the clinical side and then with the new indications you're going after plus next-generation technology? And I don't know if you want to talk about it or not, but do you want to give us any sense for when that next-generation product would be out?

Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP of Finance &amp; CFO   [24]

Yes, I'll handle the quantitative stuff, and I'll let Chris come in. So I think what you said, Matt, for the most part, is pretty accurate. If you think about 2019, the largest driver versus 2018 will be the increase in personnel, right? It's the 15 BDMs. And I know of folks who were thinking it might be as low as 10 or as high as 15, and we're on the high end of that range. So that's the lion's share of the OpEx increase. And then as you think about the R&amp;D line, it's two components, which is the product development, next-gen platform. That's the second largest driver of the year-over-year increase and the largest driver within the R&amp;D line. And then there's a small component, especially, as we get into the back half of 2019 on the clinical spend, which is the two indications. You are correct that, that will ramp and start to be a little bit of a higher number as you look at to 2020 before starting to tail back down, much like most clinicals would do. And then there's a small increase, just as you think about 2018 versus 2019, Matt, in terms of the G&amp;A costs, which is the full year of public company costs. But those are 1 through 4, the drivers of the year-over-year increase and perhaps differences in how you were initially viewing our 2019

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [25]

And our next question comes from Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Cecilia E. Furlong,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - Associate   [26]

This is actually Cecilia on for Jason. And I just wanted to ask kind of further around BDMs, CTCs and what you're viewing as what your current ratio and then just what would be an optimal ratio going forward? And then just thinking about 2019, how you're looking at or expecting the cadence of hires and to occur to -- of the BDMs and if this could provide upside to your guidance?

Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP of Finance &amp; CFO   [27]

Well, let me dissect those. I didn't write them all down. If I miss any, we can circle back. So it's 15 BDMs, much like we did as our first year of a public company is we will come out, and we'll update you how many we add each quarter. What we've generally guided folks to is to use a half year convention. So 15 BDM adds would probably equate to 7 or 8 full-time equivalents over the course of the year, and we'll fine-tune that throughout the year. As far as BDMs versus CPC, we don't have a ratio on that. We basically -- we look and assess where the territories that -- where we need to add the BDMs, and we said, we've been saying consistently, we've gone from 15 to 29, 29 to 44 and, and we'll go 44 to 59. We're going to continue to add and split territories because we have full geographic coverage now. So we'll be looking to add in those territories that we think have potential in those accounts. The CPCs, again, not on a ratio basis, but you can see that we've had a little bit of leverage on the CPCs if you just take the treatment session revenue line over the number of CPCs that we've shared with you over time. At the same time, we're always -- it's not a ratio, but we're assessing the workload in those territories and the account maintenance required. Not all accounts are created equal. Some require a little bit more maintenance. So that's sort of how we view the world. We have said that the CPCs revenue per territory have historically been down, closer to $1 million, and we said, over time, that could get a little better over time. And I think if you do the math yourself, you'll see that there's a little bit of leverage going on over the last couple of years. But that's sort of how we assess the situation, and we work hand in glove with the commercial team on where they think they need help relative to the territories

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Cecilia E. Furlong,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - Associate   [28]

Okay, great. And then if I could just ask on [OpEx] just specifically around clinical trials. You mentioned kind of seeing a little bit more of an impact from PTSD and Bi-Polar in the second half. Can you just walk us through kind of your current thinkings around timelines, what we should expect to hear from you, and then just thinking about 2020 and how that plays through?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [29]

Yes. Sure. Good morning, Cecilia. So our plan here is we're meeting with the FDA later in the year on both of these trials, and that's around the trial design. So at this point in time, I really can't comment on a timeline, and we'll keep you updated and abreast on it. But basically, we have to get, like every other company, we'd have to get our IDE approved. We'd have to enroll the patients. We'd have to assess the clinical data and then submit that to the FDA. So this is, fair to say, a several-year program for both PTSD and Bi-Polar. And as the quarters continue to advance, we'll keep you abreast of how those conversations with the FDA are and what the specific timelines are when we know them. But I think it's an exciting time for psychiatry and patients. When you think about PTSD and Bi-Polar, those two diseases, which are significant -- have significant unmet needs, both of them we know in early clinical findings have responded to NeuroStar TMS Therapy in small pilots. And we're excited about the potential of helping a group of really sick patients that don't have an alternative today. So -- and it's on our call point as well. So that's why we're kicking this off this year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [30]

And our next question comes from Alex Silverman with Special Situations

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alex Silverman,    [31]

I'm wondering -- a couple of quick questions. Wondering if you could give us any sense of that $71.5 million to $76.5 million OpEx, how much of that is noncash?

Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP of Finance &amp; CFO   [32]

Yes. The majority -- Alex, this is Peter. Just kind of making sure I fully think it through. Most of it is our cash expenses. It's personnel related to the R&amp;D efforts, the consulting efforts that go around next-gen platform, the clinical trial piece and then obviously, the sales force expansion would be all salary benefits and then the fully loaded. So I would say all if not most of it, though there's a small equity comp component in there that would lower the number, but the lion's share is cash

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alex Silverman,    [33]

Okay. Secondly, given that you haven't been public that long, wondering if you could give us a sense of seasonality in terms of first quarter mix? How we should think about it?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [34]

Yes. So -- and this is evolving a little bit as well as we get larger and larger. And there's seasonality effects for sure, typically in November and December, what we see is less patients getting started in November and December because we're starting a 6-week therapy, and a lot of doctors delay, which usually leads to a slightly lower NeuroStar treatment session in the first quarter. And then usually, treatment sessions from there take off for a couple of reasons is because we have much more systems that are installed in later part of Q3 and in early parts of Q4. And I would say, in Q1 -- Q1 is a little bit compounded with NeuroStar treatment session starts because what happens is, in Q4, you can see we had a record-breaking Q4. Our system sales were up 46%, north of $4 million. It was quite the quarter. And what happens is when we get that many systems in a short period of time and many of those systems were actually backloaded into November and December, getting them up, it's somewhat -- it's a high-class problem. It overwhelms the CPCs in the short term. So in Q1, we're digging out, getting customers up and running and trained. So for those reasons, we see a little bit of softness on the NeuroStar treatment sessions. But we typically, though, see a nice bump in NeuroStar's place year-over-year because we now have 15 more BDMs in the territory in the beginning of this quarter versus last year. So typically, we see a really nice lift in NeuroStar sales in the first quarter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alex Silverman,    [35]

Okay. And that's helpful. And last question is, what's your typical length of NeuroStar sales cycle?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [36]

Yes. So that's -- we do, and we have implemented as of the beginning of last year a CRM module. Last year, we actually are now calling on a different subsegment of psychiatrists. And the -- our expectation is the deals typically close in less than 6 months. That's at a maximum length of time, and we've had deals close as quickly as 3 weeks. And a lot is deal-specific. So somewhere between 3 weeks and 6 months is the typical cycle

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [37]

That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Chris Thatcher for any closing remarks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [38]

So thank you for joining us this morning. We look forward to keeping you abreast with the progress we make in 2019 in upcoming earnings calls. Have a good day

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [39]

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity

Your next question comes from the line of David Turkaly with JMP Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Louis Turkaly,  JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [2]

Hey, I was wondering, just as a -- I had a quick one for you about the upcoming APA meeting. I was wondering if there was anything there that you're expecting to see. Any sort of data releases or anything else like that that we can look forward to out in San Fran in a couple of weeks?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [3]

Yes. So we view this as our largest sales call of the year. We have tens of customers that were planning to meet and greet at the booth and introduce our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system to. There's a great opportunity for us to crease increased awareness around the difference in our product as well as convert our leads into sales. So we view this as our biggest sales call. There's -- we will have at the booth, we will have a series of psychiatrists talking about their experience with NeuroStar throughout the conference

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Louis Turkaly,  JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [4]

Got it. And I apologize, I was hopping back and forth between a few today, but I noticed in your remarks you talked about higher capital and then also rent to own revenue. I was wondering is there any color in terms of the split where that stands today

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [5]

Yes. Yes. Thanks, David. This is where we thought we'd be in total NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue. It is a little bit higher in rental and a little bit lower in capital but our ultimate goal is to expand our install base and we're able to do that in the first quarter and the mix is just slightly higher and slightly different than we had anticipated. There's no underlying trend in the business, we just had a slightly different mix than we expected

Do you want to talk a little bit about the accounting, Peter?

Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CFO, VP &amp; Corporate Secretary   [6]

Yes, sure. In addition, Dave, this quarter, some of the leases were accounted for that's sales-type leases. That's opposed to operating leases. I'm sure you're seeing that elsewhere as well. The impact of this is all the revenue from the lease is recognized upfront as opposed to being recognized over the term of the lease and that's an assessment, Dave, that will have to be done each quarter. Customer by customer, lease by lease, and that could cause some volatility in the NeuroStar Therapy revenue line and at least between the categories of capital sales and rental

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Louis Turkaly,  JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [7]

Got it. One last one. You mentioned the active install base, 931. Any color there? I'm just curious how many of the centers are using more than one system. And just remind us, the 931 is out of how many that you think you can actually get penetrate over time?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [8]

So David, we don't have the -- that number at our fingertips here as it relates to the number of centers that have multiple systems but it's more than a hundred, for sure, that have more than one system. And as you know, our whole goal is to increase system utilization and if you look at our system utilization we're quite proud of what we accomplished in the first quarter

System utilization is actually up and when you think about the number of system installs in Q1 versus prior year, we're up almost right around 19% in system installs with some pricing decline in NeuroStar treatment session pricing. When you think about those two numbers combined, those are really diluted to utilization and what you see is in our -- in this first quarter is utilization is actually up. So we're quite enthusiastic about our ability to ramp up our current systems with -- in the face of that dilution

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [9]

Your next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [10]

The first one for me is maybe just a little bit more color on the one customer that you guys spoke about in the morning comments that maybe pulled (inaudible) from the field. Can you give us any more clarity around whether that's competitive, operational or something else? And then did that also impact [competitive] sales for this quarter?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [11]

Yes. Thanks for the question. So yes, this was primarily driven by one large customer and the business venture did not work out for them and the systems were pulled out of the active install base. They had a very aggressive plan to grow their business and they were not able to get the business capitalized. So these systems were low-performing systems so we don't expect any sort of material impact on loss revenues from NeuroStar treatment session going forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CFO, VP &amp; Corporate Secretary   [12]

It wasn't -- to finish the question, Margaret, not competitive and no impact on the quarter. Keep in mind that you know, we use a rolling year so a lot of these fell out a while back, so it's incorporated into our guidance now it backed on the quarter, not the result of a competitive situation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [13]

Okay. Perfect. And then in terms of the year-over-year utilization growth that you guys referred to on the call, can you give us a number around that and then whether or not the -- that utilization growth, how should we think about that throughout the year especially as you guys have started investing, it sounds like, in the national DTC advertising campaign?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [14]

Yes, so the utilization is mid to low single digits in the face of a 20% dilution and when we talk about dilution in this case it's a positive event, as you well know, when we're adding 18% new systems. Those systems are typically dilutive to the utilization number coupled with a several point decline in pricing. So we're quite pleased with 20% dilution that our system utilization is actually up low to mid-single digits. So, that's a good thing. You know, we're not going to forecast the next couple of quarters on utilization but we've been able to maintain this trend now for several quarters and we're quite excited about our ability to ramp our existing customers and the fact that that number is even positive is, I think, a wonderful thing based on all of the systems that we sold in the last couple of quarters

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [15]

Got it. Great. And then maybe the last one for me. You referenced a little bit more mix on the rental side, I think on the last question. But in terms of other clarity on the system sales that you saw this quarter, are you continuing to see strong repeat purchases from those existing accounts, you know, those high volume focus accounts? And again, how should we think about this relative to your expectations both this quarter and throughout the rest of the year?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [16]

Yes. So we are seeing a slight increase over the last 4 quarters in second, third, fourth and 14th system purchased within our install base and we're seeing a slight increase. We're not reporting out on how we're breaking it out but most of our systems are first-time purchases in Q1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [17]

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jason Richard Mills,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD of Research &amp; Analyst   [18]

Chris, can you hear me this time?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [19]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jason Richard Mills,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD of Research &amp; Analyst   [20]

Good -- I [forgot] the mute button, sorry. So just start a couple of good questions already from my colleagues. So let's start in Japan. You -- you've commented about the reimbursement level. I just would like a bit more color on your strategy there. Let's say 2020 through 2022. I understand you're probably not willing to give us quantitative metrics but wanted your strategy nonetheless just as it relates to attempting to renegotiate reimbursement rates higher, what you think that will take and ultimately within those 160 centers you're allowed to start in, what can be the -- the treatment system utilization. What can be the market opportunity, I guess, from an [TAM] perspective within that cohort of centers?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [21]

Yes. So let's talk about our market segmentation strategy. No matter how many sites we were approved to go in to sell to, we were going to go into the highest -- the most respected psychiatric institutes in Japan and these are well-known institutes. All of these are on the list and we were planning on going into the places that have the highest in-patient and out-patient volume. So the 160 facilities are aligned with what I would call, you know, our inner bulls eye core, first mover commercial strategy and it will take us a couple of years to penetrate these facilities. We expect these facilities to be able to handle multiple NeuroStar's and they currently have tens of thousands of patients in-patient in these facilities. We haven't -- because of the new news around these 160 facilities, at this stage we don't have the total number of in-patient and out-patient but you should consider these opportunities as some of the largest psychiatric opportunities for us in the U.S. and in Japan and should model those accordingly

Now remember, we're just starting here in June and Japan is already -- Teijin has already bought a handful of more systems so they have an inventory in place and they're going to start selling aggressively come June 1. It's uncertain if they're going to order again in the back half of this year and as you know, it takes a little bit of time to get these things up and running so we won't see much NeuroStar treatment sessions probably into 2020 and beyond

So let me stop there, Jason

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jason Richard Mills,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD of Research &amp; Analyst   [22]

Okay. No. That's helpful. Second question. Just circling back to the install base. That having been said, the average install base for active units was a little lower than what we were modeling. So we just wanted to maybe have a new conversation here about what you see as the market opportunity. In our model, we're expecting you to exit the year sort of in and around a couple of hundred install, active install, higher than you are currently. So that would imply good growth of say somewhere in the range of 50 to 60 average ads per quarter. Is that the right way to think about the progress of your business through this year?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [23]

Yes. Jason, so our guidance to the market has always been take a look at the number of business development managers we have selling systems. Those have been pretty consistent for this quarter as well as for last year. And as we add more business development, as we sell more systems, and that's really how the capital equipment revenue was built, that in conjunction with rental revenue gives you all NeuroStar revenue and we're excited where we came in for the quarter at 41% growth. That's impressive NeuroStar revenue growth for us, right at where we expected

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jason Richard Mills,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD of Research &amp; Analyst   [24]

Okay, helpful. And then lastly, Peter, maybe bringing you into the conversation about the ASP's going forward, first on the (inaudible) sessions, the 3% decline was at the lower end of the 3% to 5% expectation and had been trending, I think, a little higher than that the pasts couple of quarters. What are the implications as we think about that juxtaposed to the HVT, the high value target initiative? And is the deceleration in decline due to coming up against tougher comps there? Or are you, indeed, seeing a stabilization around this level going forward do you think?

Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CFO, VP &amp; Corporate Secretary   [25]

That's a good question, Jason. This is Peter. Yes. The 3% to 5% remains intact, and I think we've been pretty consistent that when the growth rate tends to be in the low 20's, which it was this quarter, 21%, and keep in mind Q1 is historically a low utilization month due to starts, right, people aren't starting after Thanksgiving so you see a slowdown in Q4 and then it's the big (inaudible) assistants that are just getting up to speed. So the 21% is in line with expectations and with that, Jason, that puts us towards the lower end of the range which is 3% and, as we've said before, when that numbers ticks up into the mid 20's or closer to 30%, then you could see -- pricing breaks that would take you above or at -- at or above the 5% range. And we've seen that in the past, so I would characterize this quarter consistent with what we were expecting and obviously right on the low end of the range

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [26]

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [27]

Hopefully, you can hear me okay. Just wanted to follow up on the one larger customer that returned their systems to you. Is this something that you've seen historically with some customers doing something along this line? Maybe more of a single customer or two doing something like that? Just given that this was multiple systems. I'm sure that's going to draw a lot of attention among investors and they want to make sure there's nothing that's really systematically wrong with the ability to build models for a lot of these centers going forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [28]

So this is just one customer, all right, and we've done this now -- we have over 500 customers out there. This is one customer and this is a business that had a very aggressive plan to grow their business and they didn't get capitalized to grow their business. So this is what I would say is an isolated issue. You can see what our inactive turnover rate has been historically, and historically, it's been very low. And this is just a one-off and -- but we wanted to call it out because it was a group within one customer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [29]

Got it. And then another thing that comes up quite a bit is the competitive environment and with 41% system growth in the quarter, clearly you're not seeing much of an impact at this point. I would just love if you could comment a little bit more about the landscape that you're seeing out there as far as accounts go and time that it takes to attract and close accounts. Is that growing, is it taking longer just given some more of the maybe the competitive commentary coming out. Anything along those lines that you're seeing, you know, head-to-head wins, any other commentary that you can provide there?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [30]

Yes. Sure, thanks. Thanks, Matt. So as we all know, this is a very large market opportunity. Overall, the category is well underpenetrated and we've been competing against the current market entrees anywhere from 5 to 3 years. And nothing has really changed. You know, we have a sales and marketing organization that we estimate to be four to five times the total size of all the competitors combined and we're executing as planned. We think this is a really terrific first quarter, 25% top-line growth. This is the highest revenue growth of the -- in the companies history for Q1 and 41% NeuroStar system growth. So, we feel like we're executing as planned against the competitors out there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [31]

That's fair. The last one for me, and there's 2 parts to it but -- so I'll just ask them both here. Maybe for Peter, I think you have the tough -- you just came out of the toughest comp of the year. You've put a very good performance in Q1. Didn't change guidance at all, and so I just want to make sure that's not signaling anything that you're worried about something in the last 3 quarters of the year. Maybe you could say something along the lines of feel more comfortable with the mid-point of the range or even a little bit higher end of the range. And then the other question would be, you know, given your commentary about the new system that you're investing in right now and some thoughts among investors that it's really just a pricing game kind of environment, you know, what can you add to the feature set equation that makes this bigger investment that you're making in next generation system worth it to really continue to differentiate yourself and win in this market?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [32]

Peter, why don't you take the first one?

Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CFO, VP &amp; Corporate Secretary   [33]

Yes. I was going to take the first part, and then I'll pass to Chris for the second part. So to answer your question, no Matt, we feel really comfortable where we're at. We're right in line. We've got -- we give a range. We're in the midpoint of the range which is implicitly we feel really good about the [62.5 to 64.5] for the full year, and we're just executing to that plan

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [34]

And then as it relates to the new system, we think that as good as our system is today, it could be better. And we're focused on feature sets to make this more efficient, more precise and more reproducible and we are looking forward to delighting customers in the future when they see this next generation system. And this system will also be compatible and able to deliver our new indications as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [35]

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jason Richard Mills,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD of Research &amp; Analyst   [2]

I look forward to seeing you over the next couple of days at our conference. So Chris first, congratulations on a great quarter. I wanted to ask you about the juxtaposition of your upside growth in treatment session revenue which -- or treatment session procedures, which has been quite strong frankly for several quarters now. And then that juxtaposed to the treatment session ASPs. So I know that your policy has been to offer volume discounts and seemingly happy to do it given treatment session revenue procedures are growing so fast. But how should we think about this juxtaposition, let's say, over the next couple of years? Are we going to continue to see this level of volume discount pricing? Or will that moderate a little bit? I just can't help but think that with this level of growth in procedures, if ASPs were more in line with your long-term view of sort of 3%, 4%, that the numbers could be even bigger. And I just wanted your thoughts on that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [3]

Right. So thanks, Jason, looking forward to seeing you on Thursday at Canaccord conference. As it relates to our general guidance, we've generally guided mid-single-digit declines in ASP for NeuroStar treatment session and that will -- the decline in ASP will increase if our volume expectations are higher than we assumed in our guidance because along with higher volumes, providers get greater decreases. And if our treatment session approach should slow, then our price decline would be less in a given quarter. And that's played out consistently for the last 4, 5 quarters. So we've had another nice unit volume uptick again this quarter. And in return, the pricing decline for NeuroStar treatment sessions is slightly higher than our guidance. And that's going to remain fairly consistent. Over time, right, over time, over a year or 2, as that installed base gets larger, those price declines could be tempered longer term because they are weighted out

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jason Richard Mills,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD of Research &amp; Analyst   [4]

So to follow up on that, I mean obviously, you're not going to give the treatment sessions away. So there's going to be a diminishing returns to the ASP declines, if you will, I would assume even for the higher volume guys, right? I mean are you going to continue to offer the same level of price breaks for, let's say, the same person they got, let's say, a 10% reduction in price this year if they grow treatment session revenue in their own practice 20% to 30%? Again next year, will they also see the same level of price cuts? Does that make sense?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [5]

Yes. So just to be clear, so our pricing program and plan is based on volume, we don't have many one-off agreements on pricing. So -- and we don't renegotiate pricing every year. So when they hit a maximum volume, the price does not continue to decline year after year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jason Richard Mills,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD of Research &amp; Analyst   [6]

Okay. Great. I'll move on. Just one quick other category. I mean I was interested to see your updated operating expense guidance. The spending on PTSD and bipolar. You mentioned a little bit in your prepared remarks, but I would be interested and I think investors are interested in this sort of indication expansion opportunity. And maybe a bit more color on what your timing expectations are? What nuances you expect with respect to a clinical study? And just in general, maybe a bit more color on the target addressable market opportunity you see ahead in these markets as opposed to a market in OCD that one of your competitors is approaching? Congrats on a good quarter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [7]

Yes, thanks. So the first thing is, this is a large unmet need, both PTSD and bipolar. Directionally, these markets in total are just slightly smaller than the MDD market. This represents not only a big unmet need, but it also allows us to leverage our installed base. Psychiatrists treat PTSD and bipolar as well as MDD and they're prevalent within their practices. So this is a terrific same-store growth opportunity for us

That said, we're planning a study that's going to be a large study. These are going to be RCT studies, and these will be designed to address several things. One, the FDA's need. Second is they'll also be designed for -- to separate clinically in a way that's compelling for providers to use the technology. And then lastly, it will be designed to be compelling for financial payers to pay for it. So these are -- when we take a product to market, I've said this before, the difference between a product and a business is you have to get reimbursement. And without reimbursement, it's just a product, patients can't afford it, doctors can't afford to deliver it

So when we do a clinical trial, we think about the whole continuum as I outlined there. These are much bigger markets than OCD and you need typically larger studies that were provided -- that were provided for OCD to get reimbursement in play. So that's our thoughts on the category. We're really excited about this opportunity, and we're just kicking off the process now

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [8]

Your next question is from the line of Matthew O'Brien from Piper Jaffray

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [9]

Welcome, Steve, to your new role. I wanted to start with the fixed pricing commentary on the modeling side. I would just love to hear a little bit more about what you're doing there and then kind of how that flows through the P&amp;L? And how we should think about that influencing numbers over the next several quarters?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [10]

Yes, Matt. Yes, sure. So we wanted to comment on this because I know that we've had some questions on the U.S. Treatment Session revenue number. So just to break this down is, we've also provided commentary on the increase and the decrease in volume and price relative to prior year. I know everyone's tracking that in your models. And if you've been tracking our historical volumes and price and you utilize our reported growth rate that we share each quarter, you're going to calculate a number that is typically lower than we report in U.S. Treatment Session revenue. And that difference is what we call other treatment session revenue, which is comprised of revenue from fixed-price contracts and other ancillary components. And we want to provide you that color here today in the call

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [11]

Okay, Chris, but I think you said that the interest level in that fixed pricing model is lifting. Can you just talk a little bit more about, again, why that is? And so I think a lot of people on the call are really trying to understand the whole competitive dynamic and make sure that with that commentary plus the pricing declines that this isn't a result of you having to be more aggressive in the marketplace to get more customers and more treatment session volume

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [12]

Yes. So just to be clear, the fixed pricing model is not reflected in any ASP decline. Fixed pricing model just goes to total treatment session revenue. So they're not -- they're not interacting at all. So this is a function of what I would call a positive signal to our successful HVT penetration. This is for the best HVT targets. And we're learning how to best really partner with this customer to create a successful NeuroStar program with them. And at this point, I think -- I hope you understand, we're not going to get into all the specifics for competitive reasons on a public call, but this is definitely an emerging sales strategy for us, and we wanted to highlight it here, and I think it validates our HVT strategy overall that these larger accounts are very interested in buying multiple systems at multiple locations and working with us over a longer period of time in a contracted fashion

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [13]

Got it. Okay, that makes sense. And then the other question I had was just on the international performance. So the guidance lift for the year is really just a function of a little better visibility with what you're doing with Tiejin. And first of all, is that true? And then secondly, can you just talk a little bit more about kind of the cadence of sales into Tiejin with there a big bulk of systems placed and sold here in Q2, and you won't see that in Q3, Q4? Just any kind of color there would be helpful?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [14]

Yes. Thanks, Matt. So we're excited about Japan. I'd call it tempered enthusiasm. We're in a fuzzy front end of a commercial launch. Actually, Tiejin has done a very good job during the precommercialization phase, and it's paying off. Overall, they're off to a good start in this targeted segment. As you can see in Q2, our OUS revenues are up nicely, a result of the most recent round of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy systems sales to Tiejin. I'd also note that our increased annual guidance range does not reflect our revenue expectations for the year for Japan. I'm sorry, it does now reflect our revenue expectations for the year for Japan. So that's included in our annual guidance

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [15]

Okay. So you lifted it because of Japan specifically. Is that the right way of viewing it?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [16]

Yes, the remainder of the year, what we think is going to happen

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [17]

Your next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [18]

First, maybe a bigger picture strategic question. We talked through some of the more tactical strategic decisions that you guys are doing in terms of vis-à-vis with education and some of these new pricing models. But if we think about some of the bigger, longer-term strategic decisions that really get TMS more broadly adopted and maybe even accelerated from the point where you're at. What measures are those? What are you doing on those measures? Is it price, reimbursement, data? And do you still have room in those high-value accounts that you guys have focused on for the last year or 2?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [19]

Yes. So thanks for the question, Margaret. Our growth strategy is pretty straightforward. This is a really large market as we all know. It's underpenetrated and our ability to grow and get the patients is about hiring more people, selling more systems. And we're at the cusp of an amazing milestone, almost 1,000 systems, but that's really just a drop in the bucket. We're in the low single digits of penetration, the number of patients that we can treat, mid-single digits in the number of locations that have our systems. And this is just about us commercializing in the U.S. and continue to sell systems and demonstrate that when we hire people, we sell more systems

If we sell more systems, we treat more patients. And that is really the strategy for the next 36 months in the U.S. And then the continued growth that will come from outside the U.S. and Japan. And as we indicated, we're looking at other select thoughtful commercialization paths outside the U.S. And then right around that period of time, then we would come out with a new system that's really going to wow providers and set a new high bar for what people think about in a TMS system. And then shortly on the heels of that, PTSD and bipolar and 2 new indications. That's our growth strategy, and we're not changing

And I know something that you have a lot interest, we have a lot of interest is, we still think that there's an opportunity in the direct-to-consumer marketing campaign. We've made some good steps this past flight of TV and reducing our cost and increasing our lead-to-consults conversion rates by adding some new functionality and some new learnings. So that's our strategy. I don't think there's really a silver bullet here. I just think that it's good commercial execution as we've outlined

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [20]

Got it. So maybe switching over to guidance for a second. You guys had growth of 25% this quarter. Overall, third quarter guidance has implied kind of the 15% to 19% range. And that implies fourth quarter growth comes in, I think, a little bit slower than third quarter growth. So maybe walk us through the comps this year. What this means for the U.S. as well as for international? And I guess, more importantly, how does it set up for 2020 and beyond? Do you guys continue to view yourself, I guess, as a 20-percent-plus top line grower going forward?

Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CFO &amp; Company Secretary   [21]

Yes. So the guidance demonstrates a full year growth now between 19% and 23%, which is slightly higher than our original guidance. Q3 has been typically a sideways and sometimes down quarter. And this is a seasonal fluctuation that we've seen in the past. And you can back into our Q4 number, which is in line with full year expectations. And from there, you can start to model Q1 in 2020, and we're not going to get into guidance for 2020, but you can quickly see based on history, what that sets up Q1 to look like. So we're guiding right now from 19% to 23%, which puts us on track to be a continued 20% grower through the end of the year. And as we move into 2020, we'll provide guidance on 2020

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [22]

Okay. Yes. And I guess just one last one in terms of capital placements. I'm not sure if you guys can give us any kind of breakdown from capital sales going to existing accounts versus some of the new center openings and then are you continuing to see those repeat sales with the existing accounts continuing to drive that above-average utilization? Seems like it, but just double-checking. And as we look at volatility on pricing within capital, should we assume very much? Or is this kind of the new level going forward?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [23]

Yes. So we've given all the metrics to determine our installed base, how big our installed base and our NeuroStar treatment sessions. And you can see that once again, our installed base is up 20% over prior year. And utilization rate is up again in this quarter. So we don't report out on the systems that we're selling to existing customers versus new customers. And we haven't broken out our NeuroStar treatment sessions by customers, but we're giving you enough metrics that you can see that even adding 20% more volume to our installed base, that our utilization rates are up, that 20% is really dilutive, right, on a per system utilization rate seeing that they just got the systems. So we're quite excited about the utilization rates within our business, consistent growth rate now for 5 quarters, 20-plus percent NeuroStar treatment session, 30% on NeuroStar's, 25% overall, 5 quarters over 20%, taking up guidance, we're quite enthusiastic about what we're accomplishing here

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from Margaret Kaczor with William Blair

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [2]

First question for me is along the lines of guidance. I know you guys aren't providing 2020 guidance. But I guess what I'm hoping for is you can provide us a little bit of a sense of the moving pieces as you go into 2020. Should we assume that growth is similar to what you're seeing in the second half of this year, better than that, and kind of walk us through the moving dynamics, whether it's leasing, utilization, et cetera?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [3]

Yes, Margaret, thanks for the question. So we're -- to your point, we're not going to provide any guidance on Q4. So we can talk a little bit more -- I'm sorry, we're not going to talk about next year, we're going to talk a little bit more about Q4, as you like. But the primary softening in Q4 is a function of lower utilization rates in some of our legacy customers, and we expect our NeuroStar system volume to come in as we expected to our guidance. But the issue is that the rent to owns are significantly higher, and those are lower ASP. So those are the fundamental drivers for us taking down the guidance next year -- I'm sorry, in Q4 this year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [4]

Got it. Yes. And so let's maybe hit on those 2 items a bit. So first of all, legacy NeuroStar accounts, you referenced that maybe you're seeing some lower productivity than you expected. Have you given or seen any consistent reasons why maybe a sense of profile or scale? And then does that Q4 guidance assume that utilization within these legacy accounts improves from what you've seen in the third quarter, stay the same or gets worse?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [5]

Right. Yes. So the lower utilization really is a result of our over-indexed shift of the NPC team towards the recently sold systems. If you think about it, we've installed 174 systems in the last 12 months, which the -- new systems and 280 over the last 7 quarters. And what we're revisiting right now is the NPC call cycle has been shifted towards those 280 systems, and we need to go back and recircle on our legacy customer utilization. I don't see this being a long-term issue. These are experienced users who we need to revisit and review their practice development plans

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [6]

Okay. And then just one last one in terms of leasing dynamic. As we look out, do you see these sales-type leases increasing going forward? And how should we really look at the mix of sales versus leases and the ROI of those investments?

Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CFO, VP of Finance &amp; Company Secretary   [7]

Yes. So we offer the flexibility of a rent-to-own option for these reasons, is to minimize the upfront barriers to these larger accounts. So we can -- so they can expand to new sites faster, which ultimately gets us to more treatment session sooner. We would expect this trend to continue and I think that this further validates the strategy. I would not categorize this as a fundamental shift in our strategy. It's really a partner and execution of our existing customer segmentation strategy. But you can expect this to continue to move forward -- to continue into Q4 and beyond

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [8]

Your next question comes from Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jason Richard Mills,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD of Research &amp; Analyst   [9]

Several questions, I'll try to limit it a little bit but. Chris, talk about the competitive landscape. We've seen growth slow here. And we've also seen new competitors coming to the market over the last 12 months or so. Has that had any impact or been one of the reasons we've seen slowing growth? Could you just comment about wins or losses in the space and whether or not you've seen any regrettable departures of large customers or competitive ire is having any impact on your business at all?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [10]

Yes, Jason, thanks for the question. So the fundamental competitive dynamics really hasn't changed very much as we look at how we're performing in the marketplace. And I think that's really indicative of -- this is now our sixth consecutive quarter where we've increased the install base by 20%. And so we feel like we're operating pretty well in the marketplace

The primary drivers to the lower-than-expected guidance in Q4 is just a function of not lower systems placed and sold into the market, it's really around the ASP around those systems in the market and in a softening of our existing customers. We have really -- when you think about the growth rate that we had over the last 7 quarters, 280 systems placed, that's putting a lot more demand on the NPCs. And in a lot of businesses, and particularly in the pharmaceutical business, you have a sales call rotation with your reps, and you need to keep reinforcing behaviors. And what we're starting to recognize is we were under-indexed with our legacy customers and we would expect it to not get better in Q4, and we're moving the NPC team on an increased call cycle for our existing customer base moving forward. And we'll see how that plays out within that group

But this is not a competitive issue. I would say that this is -- when you look at the fundamentals of this business, our install base has grown 20%, the clinical performance is strong. It's still a nascent untapped market, and this is just growing things as we've rapidly expanded and penetrated new customers. And we got to get our call point ratio right between existing customers and new customers, and we're just a little bit off at the moment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jason Richard Mills,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD of Research &amp; Analyst   [11]

Okay. I mean that makes some sense, Chris. So how long do you expect, maybe you could give us a peek behind the curtain just a little bit. And I'm going to push you a little bit on 2020 because otherwise, the Street is going to value you as a 10% grower and -- given your fourth quarter guidance. And it sounds to me like you see yourself as something north of a 10% grower, and -- over the longer term

But I guess the question is, how long does it take to sort of not change the business model, but adapt to the business model from a sales force perspective with these NPCs. It sounds like the model's changing. That the legacy providers were sort of left on their own volition and sort of they didn't fall down, but they slowed down. And they need a bit more handholding, for a lack of a better way to put it. And it sounds like you expect that once those changes are instituted and you are providing better support for legacy customers, that you see growth accelerating within those customers, which at this point in time is still a relatively material piece of your business, which is why it's being reflective in lower guidance in the nearer term

Perhaps you could talk about those dynamics a little bit more and talk about what is the prudent way to model growth in the overall franchise in 2020, given the puts and takes. And I understand you're not ready to give official guidance, but I think it behooves you to talk at least directionally

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [12]

Right. So let me see if -- I'm going to try to help you out as best I can, Jason. So what are we doing right now? So we're assessing our deployment as part of our annual operating plan process. And we know for sure that we're going to add in 2020, we got to rebalance some of our NPC territories. We do this every year because of unequal and disproportionate number of new system sales going into 1 rep versus another

So we're going to add more NPCs next year, we did it this past year as you know. And I think the other thing is we need to look at either adding more CTCs and NPCs because the install base is increasing 20%, and just by definition, that means we're selling more systems year-over-year when your -- when that base is increasing 20% year-over-year. And we got to find a better balance. So we're very thoughtful, as you know. So we're going through a process here over the last several weeks to understand our call cycle frequency and how much we move. And then we're going to have to test and retest and see how fast we can move the needle on it

The good news is, right -- this is not customers that we've lost, this is customers that have trended down. They have a system. They're committed to it. And we just got to get back in there and revisit and review their practice development plans and reengage them. So this is more of a behavior versus what I would call a material environmental issue around the business. This is what I'd call just growing pains. And we shifted the team potentially too hard to these new customers, these 280 new customers, and we've got to revisit the call cycle

And I -- so this is going to take some time for us to figure out and test and retest, and we'll give you a better insight into it. But let's be clear, I mean you can project the current Q4 revenues and compare that to Q1 and Q2 and that's not going to be a 10% grower, right? The business is not going away. We just have a softening in 1 segment of our customer market. And you can see that we're adding systems as fast as we've ever had in the history of the company. So the underlying fundamentals are strong

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jason Richard Mills,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD of Research &amp; Analyst   [13]

Okay. Great. And lastly, so it sounds like just to push on that a little bit more, it sounds like you're expecting the first half of the year to improve modestly relative to fourth quarter levels and that your comps are going to be easier in the second half of the year. And with the addition of these new systems, it sounds like you might even see sequential improvement second half of '20 versus first half. So improvement as you're moving through 2020. Am I hearing that right?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [14]

Jason, we're focused on finishing the year, and we're in the process of creating our operating plan. I can't really get into specifics around 2020 at this point in time. I think we've got, again, a strong install base. I've indicated in Q4 that the number of systems that we expect to install are in line with our prior guidance of 63 to 65, but we're taking our guidance down because of lower ASPs associated with those NeuroStar systems as we get into these bigger accounts, that the primary shortfall on NeuroStar's in Q4 and then further softening of our -- a subsegment of our customer group, which is our legacy customers. And then that's going to take some time to square away, and I'm not quite sure how long it's going to take, but it's going to take us beyond Q4 probably to square that away

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [15]

Your next question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [16]

Chris, can you talk a little bit more about those legacy accounts? I mean how do you really qualify what a legacy account is? Is that something you've held for 2, 3 years? Or is it -- and how do you think about what visibility do you have as far as what kind of opportunity you have there, if they've bought a competitive product and how quickly you can turn these guys back on?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [17]

Yes. So when we think about the legacy customer group, we think about customers that acquired systems beyond 3 years and that they're up and running. And one of the advantages we have versus maybe some other medical device companies is we have pretty good transparency because most of our NeuroStar treatment session volume is done through the cloud. So we can see actual utilization trends over a period of time and see their purchases. There you see the utilization real-time versus their purchases real time

So what we're doing, Matt, is we're just going back. We're looking at these customers, they fall into 3 groups, customers that are trending below our expectations at and above and what we're going back to is the people that are trending below our expectations that have the highest volume, the highest impact is where we're circling our NPCs back to. We always factor in every year a number of, what we call, hybrid customers, customers that have competitive products in our product. We also factor in lost business. And we don't feel that those 2 metrics are off

This is just a function of -- and again, I'll say, we've seen this before in my pharmaceutical days is you can call on your high-volume docs, but you've got to go back and continue to maintain, and I think that we've shifted too far towards the most recent install class and those 280 units that we put in over the last 7 quarters, and we just need to spend a bit more time with this customer group. And remember, this legacy customer group is not the high-value target group, right? These are the customers that we brought on in early days, and we just need to spend a bit more time with them. And that's just another reason why we're moving to these higher volume targets because operationally, they can keep it rolling and these are smaller accounts, typically, that we -- our time and effort makes a difference in those accounts

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [18]

Okay, that's helpful. And then when you talk about maybe slicing this a little bit differently, the accounts you've added maybe over the last year that they have been using for a year to maybe up to 3 years. So little bit more focused on the NPC side. Do you have any sense, and I would imagine you do, given that it's all done in the cloud, what kind of growth you've seen from those accounts on the session side? Has it been high teens, 20% kind of growth out of that group, maybe over the last year or so?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [19]

Yes. We haven't aggregated -- we haven't disaggregated that on these calls. But I will tell you that relative to guidance, they're performing as we expected, those groups. I will go a step further and tell you that our fixed price contracted customers are growing significantly faster than our average customer in terms of utilization

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [20]

Okay. And then one last one actually for Steve. When you guys came public, the model was different. And I think Jason got into some of the evolving market dynamics, so I won't go there here. But with more and more of these sales-type leases coming out and some of the pricing pressure that we've seen, how do we think about gross margins going forward? This is something we thought as you were coming public would be a metric that would be certainly (inaudible) and potentially falling a little bit? Or how do we think about that in the future?

Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CFO, VP of Finance &amp; Company Secretary   [21]

Yes. I think we have a couple dynamics that will impact gross margins going forward. But there's puts and takes, and we really don't see much change from that mid-70 guidance perspective. The sales-type leases will continue. It's really a function of our partner growth in the future, something we don't have a lot of control over. But we do have control over the expense aspect. And we're at the point where we will be able to leverage our infrastructure from a service and support perspective. So we feel the ASP decline will be able to be offset by the P&amp;L leverage. So I wouldn't come off that mid-70 guidance

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [22]

Yes, just like kind of add on is, the sensitivity around this business at this size, a couple percentage shift between NeuroStar treatment sessions and NeuroStar revenue because of the large gross margin difference with it can move the gross margin a couple of points. And you can see in this quarter, our percentage of NeuroStar treatment sessions is slightly lower than it was this time last year, and NeuroStar's are a little bit higher. And when that happens, you just see a shift down. And then you also know that our international sales were up, and it's further compounded when the international sales are up and that's going to be a little bit lumpy and that can move us up 500 basis points as well from quarter-to-quarter. So those are kind of the key drivers there. And then we talked a little bit is -- a little bit about our price as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [23]

Your next question comes from Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Louis Turkaly,  JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [24]

Just on to the legacy customers, again, I just want to be clear, not any specific geography in the U.S. You said that you don't think there's any competitive impact. And it really, based on your analysis, has to do with how long they've had them. So if they've had them for longer, they're not seeing your reps as often. Is that fair?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [25]

Dave, that is fair. And so what we're seeing is that there's a little bit more time to maintain those customers than we anticipated

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Louis Turkaly,  JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [26]

Got it. And then you mentioned Greenbrook and Success as well. What percent of your business today is covered by groups like that? And I mean do we see this moving forward? I'd love you to just take a guess at where is that going? I mean are there going to be several more of these, do you think that becomes, I don't know, maybe even more significant part of your business, maybe 30%, 40% over time? Any color you can give us there?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [27]

Yes. So we haven't really talked about that -- the number specifically, but when you think about -- when we think about fixed-price contracts, you can see how fast that aspect of our business is growing. We haven't provided a specific number of systems or total installed base, but it's a little bit over 10% of our current installed base. And that's the number of systems out there or in this fixed-price contract component

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Louis Turkaly,  JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [28]

Got it. And I imagine you think that, that continues to build over the next couple of years as the companies grow, right?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [29]

Yes. Yes. So think about it, right? Our customer segmentation strategy is focused on really the top 10% of the market that those -- that treats 1/3 of patients. Well, that leaves 90 other -- 90% of market call points that we're not really actively calling on and these small doctors need to refer to somewhere. And this has given rise to this service provider concept where that doctor needs a place that's TMS-only where they can refer to. It's kind of like the orthopedic surgeon doesn't refer to an orthopedic surgeon with an MRI or x-ray. And many of the largest, largest orthopedic centers have that, they refer to radiology group

So in this way, the corollary is really these service providers are creating an opportunity for psychiatrists to TMS-only facility, meaning they just go there to get treated and come back, they don't have an option to get CVT therapy or get written a prescription. And we see this as really a function also of our direct-to-consumer efforts, right, when patients around the country seeing NeuroStar advertised, they're depressed, they'll go into their existing psychiatrist, and we -- you all understand that this market is significantly underpenetrated. And they'll go into these psychiatrists, and they just don't have a TMS, and they're looking to create an option for their patient to get treatment. And moving it to these service providers is really how they create a continuum of care within their practice

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [2]

The first one for me maybe is just to start on guidance. So in terms of the 2020 guidance, can you give us a sense of what you're modeling for average treatment revenue per system? And what does that assume for some of the legacy accounts, maybe that you guys are trying to put some new strategies around to reaccelerate?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - Advisor   [3]

So when we talk about average revenue per active system, so we see that there's a bit of seasonality and we would expect in Q1 slightly lower average revenue per active system. And then it generally increases across the year to high, typically in the back half. We believe it will be flat to slightly down because of higher installed base with slightly lower ASPs over the full year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [4]

Okay. And the impact of those legacy accounts, maybe both for the second half of 2019, so we can get a sense of -- kind of that headwind. And then what that could be over a matter of 2 or 4 quarters whenever you think that you can see some improvement there?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - Advisor   [5]

Yes. So we're monitoring that. We've been in and we've assessed those accounts. We understand what's attributing to the decline and the primary operational issues, Margaret, such as staff turnover, training new staff and one-off reimbursement challenges. The sales force has identified what those are. And over a period of time, we're tracking what we think our impact is going to be in those accounts

The thing that's going to drive most of our increased utilization or our average revenue per active system in 2020 is really our ability to scale our most recent customers. That will have the greatest impact on that number, as in all years. So the systems that we put in last year will have the greatest impact on utilization across 2020

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [6]

Okay. And just one last question for me. In terms of kind of those latter -- that latter focus in terms of the bigger physician accounts and kind of the TMS-only centers. Is there anything that has surprised you over the last few quarters? And what do you think they can do and what can you do for them to continue to help scale going into 2020?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - Advisor   [7]

Yes. So the TMS-only accounts -- just to give everyone a sense of where TMS-only fits in, there's about 5 companies out there, maybe several of those emerging. Of the 5 that are out there, we believe that we know we have the primary market share within those accounts. To give you a sense of the TMS-only, TMS-only really provides patient referrals to accounts that don't have a TMS system. So our market focus right now is on 22% of the solo improved practices, which is about 5,700 of the 25,000 accounts that exist, and that's about 60% of the MDD patients in the segment. And really, with the TMS-only providers, our playing is in the 78% of the accounts that we're not targeting that have about 40% of the MDD patients

So this is how we address the entire market. We are the primary partner for TMS-only. And then we have our sales force, our BDM team selling on and selling into the highest potential single and group practices in 2020

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [8]

And our next question comes from the line of Jason Mills with Canaccord Genuity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Cecilia E. Furlong,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Associate   [9]

This is actually Cecilia on for Jason. And I just wanted to ask about your recent strategy, shifting the focus from growing the BDM force and just your outlook beyond 2020. I know you talked about mid-50s being kind of a target range for now. But beyond 2020, as you expand indications, does this seem like the right size? Or will you continue to evaluate that? And just from an SG&amp;A standpoint in 2020, can you talk about the impact of really growing your force rather than the BDM size sales team?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - Advisor   [10]

Okay. So to give you a sense of where we are with the BDM team in 2020. On a weighted average in 2020, we had about in the high 40s of full-time equivalents for BDMs, and we believe, this year, we'll have BDMs in the mid-50s. We also think that with the increase in the number of new accounts per reps, plus, we also are forecasting a slight increase in the number of second system sales. For the last 24 months, we've been getting into larger accounts, and we are seeing higher rates of second system sales. So we believe that with this modest increase year-over-year in BDMs with a slightly higher productivity rate, that we'll have a record 2020 in terms of new system sales for the year

As it relates to beyond 2020, we're going to monitor and manage the business appropriately and we'll guide on 2021 in the future. That said, we are shifting more resources to NPCs and CTCs to bring and improve our average revenue per active system and bring that metric more in line with our unit sales of 20%. So that's the real big thrust for us here. We'll chart the progress of those new NPCs and CTCs on impacting pull-through at the account level. And then at the end of the year, we'll be really thoughtful and assess and then decide what we're going to do in 2021 and beyond

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Cecilia E. Furlong,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Associate   [11]

Okay. Great. And then, I guess, just also turning to revenue guidance. Just what are you thinking in terms of capital ASP trends in 2020 as well as installed base growth that's factored into your guidance, especially as we continue to target these high-volume accounts? And just how you're thinking about the mix in these accounts between sales and sales-type leases?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - Advisor   [12]

Okay. So the question is, how are we thinking about top line growth. So -- well, we think about it in 2 parts. So as I mentioned, we think the productivity of BDMs will remain constant to slightly up. So we expect a record-breaking year on the capital unit sales in 2020. That said, we expect a slightly lower blended ASP, which is a function of the capital sales and the sales-type leases in 2020. So the combination of those will create a little bit of downward pressure on ASPs for 2020 and we're not going to break out the mix between that. We are giving you the total unit sales each and every quarter

And as I mentioned, we've sold a significant number of systems over the last year. And these systems have not ramped up to a steady state. We know we have a much higher percentage year-over-year in systems that are less than 18 months. So this lowers our overall average revenue per active system each and every quarter. So while we're treating more -- and selling more treatment sessions year-over-year, the U.S. treatment session revenues are not growing in line with the active installed base because of that reason. And we're looking to add NPCs and CTCs to close the gap on that. We also expect slightly -- some slight downward pressure on our per click treatment sessions, ASPs to continue in 2020 as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [13]

And our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Brien with Piper Sandler

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Andrew William Stafford,  Piper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division - Research Analyst   [14]

This is Drew on for Matt. I just kind of wanted to go back to some of the utilization in the legacy accounts that impacted you last quarter. It sounds like it didn't bounce back by too much in Q4 as you had expected. But I guess the question is, did you see any improvement as the quarter went on in those accounts? And then sort of what gives you confidence that it can improve going forward? And then I guess, lastly, on that, I mean, mainly, can you give us a feel for what level of rep expansion to address this issue specifically has been incorporated into your OpEx guide?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - Advisor   [15]

Sure, Drew. So for Q4, we did not expect to see any change in utilization in those accounts. We are basically in there diagnosing and trying to understand what the circumstance is. The good news is that most of this has been attributed to operational issues, as I just explained. And these are well within the bailiwicks of the NPC, CTC and reimbursement team to resolve. Short term, what we did is -- and [ARC's] currently doing is shifting the cull patterns of the NPCs that we have in the company now to spend more time on this group of customers. And as you heard, what we plan to do is, to address this longer term, is we're increasing the number of NPCs to 7 and the number of CTCs to 2 to provide more touches to the existing customers while at the same time, being able to scale our ever-expanding and growing installed base. So overall, that's how we're addressing that customer group

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Andrew William Stafford,  Piper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division - Research Analyst   [16]

Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the international side, I guess, especially in Japan. I know you're getting -- just getting started there, yet you had a difficult comp in Q4 of '18. But obviously, a pretty large opportunity. And it just kind of seems to be moving a little bit slow. Are you making any additional investments to kind of speed up the process there? And then, I guess, any impact from the coronavirus?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - Advisor   [17]

Okay. Great. So last year was a start-up year, right? It's really the building and the beginning of the foundation. We got approved in June. And the purchases last year was really to create inventory for both NeuroStar and new NeuroStar treatment session. This year is really all about the pull-through of that inventory and replacing an inventory and we'd expect to see orders of capital equipment across the entire year. And then we gradually see increasing in NeuroStar treatment session purchases. So this is really going about as planned. We're pretty impressed with their early sales they've gotten in Japan. They've gotten the leading key opinion leaders to purchase at their universities over there. We're getting some really good national publicity over there. So I think we're growing as we expect it to grow in that market. That said, is we're not expecting significant growth in Japan based on what I just said. Most of the inventory that was sold, most of the sales last year was to build inventory. It wasn't the pull-through of inventory. And then this year, we'll see that pull-through of inventory. They have added incremental sales reps to the organization in the back half of last year, and that looks promising as well. And remember, we do not fund any of the SG&amp;A for this operation in Japan. Teijin is responsible for that part of the business planning and investment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [18]

And our last question comes from the line of Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Louis Turkaly,  JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [19]

And just going back to the legacy account, the 100 or so we talked about last quarter. It looked like the attrition was something like 25 in this quarter, fourth quarter. And I was wondering if you could just comment on -- are you culling some of those older accounts and what you expect that -- it's a little higher than, say, what you've averaged in the past. Just maybe color on what you expect in 2020 for that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - Advisor   [20]

Right. So it was a little higher in the fourth quarter, and it's typically a little bit higher in the fourth quarter for the last several years. And remember, when an account goes inactive, that means they haven't bought a treatment session for us -- from us in 12 months. So these are usually decisions that happened in the fourth quarter of the prior year. So it seems that there's a little bit or slightly higher business decisions are made about closing a practice, stop providing TMS as a service line and/or moving to a competitive system. Those seem to have happened more often at the end of the fourth quarter. So it's slightly higher this quarter than our prior 3 quarters

We don't anticipate that run rate continue. We believe it will go down to probably somewhere around 1.5% a quarter, somewhere in that range, give or take, a quarter or a half each and every quarter. So we're not proactively culling it. And remember, this is -- most of these are people that are getting out of practice or can't make TMS work. And that's one of the reasons why we have evolved our strategy in the last 24 months to get into higher volume accounts that have more back-office capabilities and greater capacity to operationalize a NeuroStar in their practice. And most, if not many of these, are legacy customers that have decided not to continue with the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy or have gone out of practice

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Louis Turkaly,  JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [21]

Got it. And then just looking to the guidance, actually, the revenue commentary, the breakout. Just curious to break out operating lease but not the sales-type that's now included in the capital. I guess the logic there, I'm just curious if you would even comment sort of on how sizable that sales-type lease could be in that capital sales and why break out operating if you think that's trending towards 0?

Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CFO   [22]

Yes, Dave. We're trying to move away from the financing differentiation of systems sold. So going forward, we're going to report systems sold and the total revenue for those systems and really get away from differentiating between sales-type lease and traditional capital sales. It really is just, really, capital acquisition strategies for our customers. And as a reminder, we only offer sales-type leases to our large TMS-only service providers. Our strategy is to free up their capital so they can continue on with their expansion plans and not have their monies tied up with the system acquisition costs. And so those -- that subsegment will continue to grow and will grow at a higher rate than traditional capital equipment sales in 2020, somewhere north of 30%. And that's why you'll see some fluctuation in the ASPs as that mix changes quarter-to-quarter. But again, we feel it's more important to get installed base growing north of 20% like we've done in the past 7 quarters. And ultimately, the treatment session volumes will catch up

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Louis Turkaly,  JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [23]

Got it. And I think last quarter, you gave sort of an update on Greenbrook, Success, some of the others. Just curious if you could provide any update on sort of the mix for the TMS-only providers today? I mean I imagine it increased again, but just directionally, I imagine that continues in 2020. But any update on the size of those guys for you today?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - Advisor   [24]

Yes. Thanks, Dave. So as it relates to some of these large TMS-only accounts like Greenbrook and Success TMS, we prefer for them to comment on their earnings calls as it relates to their performance in the marketplace. But we're delighted to partner with these groups. We think that our value proposition really resonates with this group. We have significant investments in field service engineering, tech support, and our TrakStar system provides them real-time insights into their locations, utilization of their systems. So we think our value proposition on many fronts really resonates with this group. We're not going to be breaking them out on a go-forward basis. And they'll be part of our overall NeuroStar treatment session revenue and our NeuroStar capital revenue

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor from William Blair

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [2]

Maybe, first, to start out, we can dive into the sales and marketing spend and the changes you guys are making there. So first, can you give us details in terms of how many BDMs do you have as well as on NPC CTCs and whether you're keeping that structure or not?

Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [3]

We are maintaining that structure. I would say the most significant change we have made to the sales organization was integrating those 3 functions vertically. Prior to early March, we had a different management structure. Now we feel going more vertical with BDMs, NPCs and CTCs under the same manager was the more efficient approach and extremely timely, given the environment we're operating in. The specific numbers, I don't think of that relevant at this point, but we do -- we will be maintaining that same type of structure and support to our customers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [4]

Okay. Yes. So part of it is the impact of what that means for kind of 2 types of accounts that you guys have, so you referenced focusing primarily on those TMS-only accounts. But on the same token, we've seen a little bit of pressure on the legacy accounts over the last few quarters. So maybe you can give us a sense of how you're strategically changing the focus on that as well as the percentage of sales that those accounts could represent, will be represented?

Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [5]

Sure. Yes, in 2019, we did see a significant shift in sales to the TMS-only service partners and we are forecasting that to continue into 2020 and 2021. These entities are very self-sufficient and don't need the level of support that stand-alone practices or psychiatrists require. So we are able to redirect some of our BDM time to our traditional customer base. From an MPC and CTC perspective, it's pretty much the same type of model. Again, those service providers are again self-sufficient and have great business models and are able to conduct their business without a lot of our support. Obviously, we do offer training and other types of support to those partners. But they are less reliant on the Neuronetics' offerings

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [6]

Okay. I think the question for me is more focused on the legacy accounts. So those would be the accounts that I assume maybe were closed a little bit more or maybe aren't giving as much TMS treatment during this environment. So between that and maybe less support potentially coming to them, does that mean that that segment can grow or is it going to decline for a bit while you guys refocus back on those TMS-only accounts?

Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [7]

Yes. During our last conference call, Malgorzata, we did indicate that we had a program in place to address those legacy accounts. We highlighted the top 150 and our MPCs have been working with each of those legacy accounts. Again, a lot of these operational issues that led to some of those volume declines were, I would say, easily addressed by our MPC team and hopefully they can get those legacy accounts back to the volumes where they were prior to that drop-off that we saw in Q3 and Q4 of '19

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [8]

Your next question comes from the line of Marie Thibault from BTIG

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Marie Yoko Thibault,  BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Director &amp; Digital Health Analyst   [9]

Just a follow-up on Margaret's question, I'm curious what you saw in the first 2 months of the quarter when things were a little bit normal in terms of the success of efforts to increase utilization of the legacy accounts. Any color you can give us there?

Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [10]

Not specifically, but again as we communicated on the call, the expectations as late as March 13, where we were going to achieve the guidance that we had previously offered at $13.5 million to $14 million, a lot of the inputs from the field, both from BDMs and MPCs were that at least until that point the impact on from COVID-19 wasn't really material, and then all of a sudden, that last 2.5 weeks of March volume declines were extremely material. I will say that the program that we put in place was still relatively early in Q1. So it would be difficult to forecast those results but we did have a well-formalized program to again get those volumes back to where we saw them in the early part of 2019

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Marie Yoko Thibault,  BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Director &amp; Digital Health Analyst   [11]

Okay, sure. And then with a couple of states or some states opening last week, are you seeing any customers in those geographies? I guess any early color you can tell us about centers reopening or treatment session volumes? And interested by the idea of an uptick and more patients coming out of this quarantine and needing the mental health help, are you positioning for any new marketing efforts around that with your customers? Anything you can tell us about that would be helpful

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [12]

So regarding the states that are starting to ease the restrictions, yes, our customers that are seeing those easings are starting to restart the business. Speaking with our TMS-only providers, they really haven't skipped a beat, they've really been pushing to maintain their treatment session volumes. I think the one area being hardest hit still is the Chicago area that's slowing a little bit of progress there. But all in all, I think you're seeing a general slow reopening of those centers, the 33% that had ceased treatment. One of the key indicators that we look at -- so we track sales, utilization, but also the MT or motor-threshold starts; and we did see a nice uptick towards the end of April that would indicate to us that it's not a 100% correlated, but it is correlated to the new patient starts, which you would think would lead to a bit of a recovery as we head into May and June. So we are seeing some signs that we are gradually starting that uptick

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Marie Yoko Thibault,  BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Director &amp; Digital Health Analyst   [13]

And then anything on marketing for new patients?

Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [14]

Yes. So we have started some, I would say more strategic focused marketing efforts. Again, we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, again trying to preserve cash and being unsure of the length and the magnitude of COVID-19, but we did see in April the incidence of depression scripts spiked up significantly and 75% of those scripts were for new patients. So following the treatment protocol of TMS being indicated for one failed drug, you can envision a potential increase in TMS treatments towards the latter half of 2020

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [15]

Your next question comes from Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [16]

I guess just to start with your various customers out there, you've got the TMS-only providers, the chains, you've got the independent providers as well. Can you just talk about their ability to ramp back up from a capital perspective to get back going? I know in the past you've had some--one of your chain providers actually gave your systems back, is that a potential headwind we could see if some people decide that they just can't make a go of it in this environment that we could see over the next several quarters? So just how the things go out here from a patient treatment perspective as been to Q3 and then capital perspective, is it more expecting very little capital sales Q2, Q3, maybe a little bit more in Q4? Just that general ecosystem, how do we think about things progressing there?

Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [17]

Yes, I think our existing customers will be in the best position to restart since they already have the capital in place. Again, depending upon the duration of some of the social distancing and stay-at-home orders some of the lower-volume customers could be impacted more than others. I think one of the fallouts of this pandemic could be some consolidation depending upon the customers' both economic and just overall willingness to continue with TMS. I just think it's too early to tell

We do have a number of third-party financing partners that are still willing to lend to our customers. And so at least from that financing perspective, that hasn't dried up at this point and I know our sales team is still out there, pushing for transactions and selling as many NeuroStars as they can. So I do think the environment will likely change. Again, it really depends on how long this last and what the economic impact is to our customers. But I was going to say the TMS-only partners, they probably are and the larger facilities are in the best shape to come out of this even stronger

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [18]

Okay. So I know you're in cash preservation mode, but you're much better capitalized than many of your other competitors in this space. And so I'm curious, you've got flexible financing plans available for customers. So is there an opportunity with some maybe wounded competitors to get some of that share away from them in this environment, maybe near term and maybe that being a little bit of a backstop for our system placements goal?

Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [19]

I mean that possibility exists. And so Matt, making these difficult decisions and reducing our workforce, it certainly wasn't easy. But Andy and I, as soon as we saw some of the indicators in mid-March really start to decline, knowing that 2 of our more valuable assets were our commercial team and our strong balance sheet, we really wanted to make sure that we were in a great position to come out of this whenever the end of the pandemic comes. And so yes, part of that strategy, could be maybe being a bit more aggressive on the sales side, using that strong balance sheet to our advantage when it comes to sales and understanding that customers are making their purchasing decisions, not only on our best-in-class technology but also on the longevity of the company, and who is likely to survive and thrive once this is all behind us. So yes, that is certainly a possibility

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division - MD and Senior Research Analyst   [20]

Okay. And then just one more from me if you don't mind, just the reductions across the organization, we're a little bit steeper than I was expecting, again I know you guys are trying to preserve cash, the smart move but again, a little steeper than I expected. So as we come out of this, what kind of grower is Neuronetics? And how do you support your customers? Because a big part of the store really is your customer support and everything else like that; so what happens to the organization from here and what kind of grower do you look like?

Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [21]

I really think part of that will be dictated by the level of economic recovery. Similar to a lot of industries, there's just a lot of unknown as to what the fallout will be. But the one thing we did do was in -- and share our financial ability to weather this storm and I agree we were, I would say, extremely aggressive with what we did in late March and early April. And it really was to preserve the company. You know, assuming things got back to normal or close to what normal was pre COVID, I think the company again with would be growing along the lines of what we previously communicated. And again with the increase in depression prescriptions during March and April, it is reasonable to think that some of that increase will eventually head towards TMS Therapy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [22]

Your next question comes from Cecilia Furlong from Canaccord Genuity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Cecilia E. Furlong,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Associate   [23]

I just wanted to ask again just about your sales force specifically from a territory perspective and from a BDM perspective, kind of what you're seeing now after the reductions, but then more so longer term, what you see as kind of coverage-at-scale level, especially given your new kind of focus within just HVT?

Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [24]

So the territory realignment is still a work in process at this point. We still view the territory alignment based on opportunities, density, the amount of coverage that BDM can appropriately cover as well as a bit of productivity in the back of our minds. We do think that once those territories are fully aligned that the BDMs will have the opportunity to both make money and also service the accounts that they're assigned

So at this time and again -- with the increase in TMS-only providers, some of that opportunity within those territories really is deflected to those partners. And so again, we think with the vertical management integration and that support structure our BDMs will be able to be more efficient and also more productive, and we do reserve the right or ability to add back resources as the economic environment unfolds

This really was, I would say, a very aggressive action to secure our balance sheet, but we will not jeopardize the service offerings that we have in place for our customers. And so if we see strains or pressures within the commercial organizations, we do reserve the right to add those resources to assist our customers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Cecilia E. Furlong,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Associate   [25]

Great. And if I could also ask just within the reduced spending this year, just how you're thinking about R&amp;D, specifically the NextGen system and your pipeline initiatives -- bipolar being the primary one -- but just how kind of these reductions may play out on timelines in that perspective

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [26]

Yes. From an R&amp;D perspective, the projects that we had in place at the beginning of the year are still in place. I will say we did slow some of the spending in R&amp;D. Again and late March in April, it's the duration and the severity of COVID that we didn't fully understand. So we didn't think it was prudent to go out and kind of execute on our original plan that was in place what we had our original 2020 plan in place. But that's still exists and is an ongoing project

Regarding the other indications, again, we've communicated in the past and we continue with discussions with the FDA. Obviously the pandemic has redirected some of the FDA resources. Honestly, they have a lot more on their plate with COVID-19 than worrying about how we're going to structure our clinical trial with bipolar, but those discussions do continue, and we are hopeful and optimistic that we can come up with a collaborative resolution and see where that heads in the future

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [2]

A few for me. Just to start, COVID -- the COVID updates you guys gave are pretty meaningful. Sounds like maybe the new patient starts are nearly back to normal. So first, can we say that it's fair to call new starts between 90% and 100% of pre-COVID levels? And then second, how long does it take for those new patient starts at this rate to get treatment revenue back to that pre-COVID level?

Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [3]

So thanks for the question, Margaret. And yes, it is safe to say that the current new patient starts are at pre-COVID levels. And so we are anticipating those favorable trends to continue throughout Q3 and Q4, assuming we don't get hit with a second stage. Obviously, once the new patient starts -- traditionally, 97% of those patients will continue through the approximately 36 treatment sessions for the therapy. And so again, we are forecasting that, I would say, modest sequential growth to continue throughout 2020

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [4]

Okay. And that sounds a little conservative to us, especially on the back of what the reimbursement decisions that you did talk about this quarter. Can you give us any background on those? How long were you working on them? And how do you compare these relative to some of the prior reimbursement decisions that you guys have had?

Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [5]

Yes. So we have an employee dedicated on working with our providers to ensure that the reimbursement does get to the levels that were indicated, which is one failed drug treatment. So these are really ongoing efforts and not something that was more definitive in terms of a time line. And I expressed this during our last call. I mean this is critically important really for the patients. If the payers are requiring 4 failed drugs for reimbursement, it could take a patient between 12 and 24 months of failed drugs, which accompany multiple side effects potentially before they're able to get to TMS therapy. And so we view the 4 failed drugs to 2 as being a huge step for these 3 payers

Again, ultimately, it would be great if we could get consistent reimbursement coverage for the indication of one failed drug, but those efforts do continue on a daily basis, and we are extremely pleased with those decisions in the second quarter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Malgorzata Maria Kaczor,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst   [6]

Okay. Yes. And then last one, if I could. Keith, you've been around a while. We've known you for a while at ZELTIQ. How would you compare maybe your initial thought processes going into ZELTIQ versus Neuronetics? And as you think about where you're going to spend your time over the next 12 months, is it customer focused? Is it reimbursement decisions? And what would you define as a success a year from now?

Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [7]

Well, good to hear your voice, Margaret. It's been a while. I think that -- as I mentioned in my remarks, I think there's an opportunity to build greater awareness within the patient community on TMS. And I think that to date, the company has done a good job, but I think we need to update the market research to find out who is our target audience today and then how to get to them. So I think we are doing the call center. We're doing digital and social marketing. But I think over the next 12 months, we'll be able to refine that and be able to do a better job at targeting those patients and building the awareness

Secondly is also helping the accounts themselves, be able to bring those patients in and then convert them. So it's similar to the opportunity that was at ZELTIQ. There's always a little nuances with each business, but I think that there is a chance -- a strong chance -- that we can take some of the learnings from that and apply them here

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [8]

Your next question is from Matt O'Brien with Piper Sandler

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Andrew William Stafford,  Piper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division - Research Analyst   [9]

This is Drew on for Matt. I wanted to push just a little bit on the COVID trend for some of your downstream customers. Obviously, good to hear on the new patient side. I understand that patient throughput may be a little bit more challenging as there are a lot of numerous requirements for bringing the patient back in office. But I guess just stepping back a little bit, what brings the 20% of [signaries] that you mentioned that are closed back online? I mean is that primarily related to regional outbreaks of COVID? Is there any concern that some of them could be permanent closures or something else?

Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [10]

Yes. What we're seeing, Drew, is it's really geographically focused at this point. So there are still significant hotspots throughout the country, and a lot of those states are actually where we have a lot of NeuroStar systems. So we don't anticipate a lot of permanent shutdowns, but some of these centers are obviously still impacted by local and governmental restrictions. So it may take them longer to restart

Again, if you look at Illinois and Chicago, that one in particular has been slower than most to restart and regain the traction. But ultimately, as we work through the pandemic, we do believe that the majority of customers that are presently shut down will come back online

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Andrew William Stafford,  Piper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division - Research Analyst   [11]

Okay. That's helpful. And then I just was wondering if you could kind of speak to some of your priorities to COVID here. You've made some adjustments on the expense side. It sounds like you (inaudible) capital environment would be just a little bit more challenging for a little while here. Are your customers receptive to the operating lease type model in this kind of environment still? And then, I guess, are there any plans to push a little more aggressively on the treatment session side with some of your existing customers to help offset any weakness you might see in capital?

Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [12]

Sure. I mean we don't offer operating lease financing. What we have is what we term sales type leases, which prior to 2019 could be considered operating leases. But we only offer them to a handful of customers. It's really just targeted towards the TMS-only service providers. Again, our strategy with that subgroup of customers is to make sure they preserve their capital so they can continue to expand as opposed to tying up hundreds of thousands of dollars in NeuroStar capital equipment sales, which could slow their expansion efforts. So it's a very strategic partnership with our largest customers

Secondly, regarding ASPs on treatment sessions, no. The -- we don't see discounting being necessary. The reimbursement for our treatment sessions -- and again, this varies by payer and also geography so it's certainly not the same amount of reimbursement throughout the country, but it is a very favorable economic picture for psychiatrists and other customers

Again, even if you assume an average of $200 reimbursement per treatment sessions, the payback on our machines is about a patient in a year or 7 patients a year. So it is -- they are pretty quick to pay these machines off

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [13]

Your next question is from the line of Cecilia Furlong with Canaccord Genuity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Cecilia E. Furlong,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Associate   [14]

Great. I guess I just wanted to start off with what you saw in Q2 in terms of rebound but really focusing on the TMS-only centers and just their ability to rebound on a relative basis versus some of your smaller customers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [15]

Sure. I mean, obviously, the Greenbrooks of the world and Success TMS, they're are extremely large entities and better equipped to weather the COVID-19 pandemic. Obviously, they were impacted as we all were, but the TMS-only service providers have certainly recovered quicker than some of the smaller facilities. And that's really due to their scale and expertise and changing the way they treat patients. And for example, people don't wait -- or patients don't wait in waiting rooms anymore. It's a very continuous flow through the facilities. So you don't have people in the same room potentially spreading diseases. And so they were able to optimize their workflow and really get ahead of the recovery efforts

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Cecilia E. Furlong,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Associate   [16]

Great. And I guess if I could also ask just on your high-level thoughts on OpEx beyond 2020. Early R&amp;D, your focus there specifically and the relative priority in the pursuit of PTSD and bipolar depression indications. I know you commented briefly in your prepared remarks, but just any further color you could give around -- your thoughts around priority of those 2 objectives

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [17]

Yes. So in April, when we saw the precipitous decline in treatment session utilization as well as new patient starts, we took the swift and decisive action to reduce our expenses. We did communicate that that was for cash preservation, and we would not restart investments until we were comfortable that we were out of the COVID environment. The recent trends certainly indicate we're heading in a favorable direction, and even the July data was pretty impressive. But we really don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves in terms of 2021. So this is something that Keith, I and the rest of the senior team are looking at, again, planning for a restart, but again, not getting too, too far ahead of ourselves

We've had ongoing conversations with the FDA that have been very positive. But until we get comfortable with their position and opinions on clinical trial structure and things like that, we're not prepared to really launch something that lengthy and that expensive

Regarding our next-gen platform, again, that was slowed, but it's still on the radar. And these are the decisions that we'll work through during our planning process, which starts next month

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [18]

Our next question is from the line of Marie Thibault with BTIG

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Marie Yoko Thibault,  BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Director &amp; Digital Health Analyst   [19]

Welcome, Keith. Nice to have you here

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [20]

Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Marie Yoko Thibault,  BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Director &amp; Digital Health Analyst   [21]

I want to ask a question on the capital sales this quarter. They were actually a bit better than we had feared. And so I wanted to get a little bit more granularity on those system sales, the types of centers those were going into and if there's any additional detail you could give us along those lines

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [22]

Yes. Again, given the environment of Q2, we were pretty impressed with the ability of our BDMs to transact that many systems. You would also expect to see, I think, a more focus on the TMS-only centers. When we looked at the data, the percentage of TMS-only versus, I would say, traditional facilities didn't vary from previous quarters. And so it was just our traditional mix between regular psychiatrists and those TMS-only centers

We do think that there could be an increased focus on TMS-only as we get into Q3 just based on their ability to recover quicker than some of the other facilities, but we'll have to see how that plays out in the quarter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Marie Yoko Thibault,  BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Director &amp; Digital Health Analyst   [23]

Okay. Great. And I guess I wanted to dig a little bit on your commentary about a lot of systems and some of those hotspot states. Do you have kind of a general breakout of how many or what proportion of systems fit in the South and West, some of those states that are being hardest hit right now?

Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [24]

So we actually -- we do have the ability to monitor everything on a state-by-state basis, and we actually do look at utilization trends every day. And so yes. Naturally, our highest density states are Illinois, Chicago, Texas, California, and essentially, many of the states that are getting hit hard again. But again, our customers have figured out the optimal way to safely treat patients and also keep their staff safe. And so we haven't seen a significant impact even in those states. They've certainly recovered at a very impressive rate since the low point in May. And again, those trends have continued into the month of July

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [25]

That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Keith Sullivan for closing remarks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [26]

Thank you. Thank you, operator. Thanks again for joining us today. While it's early in my tenure, I'm very impressed with the team we have and our ability to move quickly and adapt. For the balance of the year, we will be heads down focused on executing in a dynamic environment, while at the same time, looking to the future and putting a long-term strategy in place. I look forward to updating you on our progress on our next quarterly call. Thank you for joining

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Research Analyst   [2]

I guess, Keith, can we start with the realignment plans on the BDM and NPC side of things? You've seen these in the past. I'm assuming that you're getting a look under the hood now and that's the conclusion that you've drawn probably in collaboration with Sara. But seeing these historically, typically, isn't just 6-month period to really refine the sales force and change territories, et cetera, before you really see a meaningful improvement. It's typically more like a year or more than that. So I guess what gives you the confidence you're going to really start to see the improvement in the second half of next year? And then how do you really make sure that your larger TMS provider customers are comfortable with how things are being adjusted?

Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [3]

Thanks, Matt. I think the analysis that we did of the sales organization is that we have a pretty good team in place. And that when we are restructuring the sales organization, we're really redefining what the BDM territories would look like. We're balancing them so that they will each have a specific number of psychiatrists involved in them

So right now, we -- because of the realignment earlier in the year, there are much -- there are some territories that are very large and some that are very small. So on the BDM side, we balance them. On the NPC side, again, I think we have a talented group that's out there. And what we're trying to do is make them more effective in the field by also balancing them to have about between 30 and 35 accounts each

So we are going to provide training throughout January and at our sales meeting on how we can best utilize the data from our market research. But we're not overhauling the sales organization, we're just trying to make them more efficient

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Research Analyst   [4]

Okay. All right. That's really helpful. And then, I mean, just to put a little bit finer point. On the said guidance that you're providing for Q4 is a little bit below the street, certainly not the end of the world. But as we think about the first half of next year, should we still think about a contracting business for the first couple of quarters and then hopefully getting back to -- even to growth next year, assuming that we don't have another big outbreak of COVID?

Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [5]

Yes. Matt, this is Steve. No, we're still budgeting and planning for a rebound in 2021. I know the expectations are to get back to either at or above 2019 levels and that is something we're certainly not shying away from. Obviously, there's still some economic and pandemic dependencies. But no, with the revamped commercial structure along with the revised strategy, we're looking at growth to return in 2021

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Oliver O'Brien,  Piper Sandler &amp; Co., Research Division - MD &amp; Senior Research Analyst   [6]

Got it. And just one more for me. I know this is probably a little bit further out question. But Keith, your commentary about the first-line therapy is obviously extremely interesting and compelling. I mean, what steps need to happen to get to that point? And then I know this is a difficult question to answer, but can you just frame up a potential time frame for when something like this could, even just a few insurance providers, be the first-line of therapy rather than drug?

Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [7]

Matt, that's a question that we talk about almost daily here. I think we are digging into our TrakStar data where we have 72,000 patients. And in our registry, which is a subset of that, we have over 5,000 patients. So we are looking at that data to be able to help put the information into a formula that can be used by the societies to take to the payers. And I have no idea what the time frame on that is. I think we should have a handle on our data in the next several months. But how long the payers take to react to it? I don't know

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [8]

Your next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor with William Blair

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brandon Vazquez,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Associate   [9]

This is Brandon on for Margaret. If I could just follow-up on that last question first. As we look to a rebound in the business and you get to 2021 and creating more of a sustainable kind of growth rate, do you think you need to have some of these market access wins in order to hit your internal goals? Or can just some reconfiguring and refining of the commercial organization be enough to kind of make a more sustainable growth profile?

Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [10]

So what I will tell you is in the research that we have backed so far is our opportunity just in treating MDD is large, and the number of physicians that are not using NeuroStar Advanced Therapy at this point is also large. So I think we have a large amount of runway to go without any other indications. But I think we have an opportunity to advance the ball on a couple of different fronts. We all know that it's going to take time with the FDA and then with the payers, but I think we're starting to move forward on those fronts

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brandon Vazquez,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Associate   [11]

Got it. And then as we look towards kind of on the system utilization side and the system revenue side -- or sorry, rather the treatment revenue side. Steve, you had mentioned it needs a little over $10,000 per active system as the year-over-year comp. As we go moving forward into '21, should we think about the system base or the installed base able to reach kind of a $10,000 plus number? And then as we kind of look at a sustainable 2021 plus, is $10,000 kind of a floor? Can we look for upside there or is that kind of a level where we level out?

Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [12]

Yes. Brandon, our expectations are to continue to increase utilization throughout the period near term. You saw about a year ago, we felt the initial utilization declines and had plans in place to address it, and then COVID hit and really limited our ability to go out and work with the customers who saw those declines. We fully expect to reengage those customers as well as others with our NPCs and co-marketing programs and other awareness tools to drive well beyond that $10,000 average revenue per system

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brandon Vazquez,  William Blair &amp; Company L.L.C., Research Division - Associate   [13]

Got it. And just one last one for me. I appreciate there's probably some noise going on in the Japan business given COVID. But any updates there, even just anecdotal feedback? How the commercialization is going there? And any updates on the potential reimbursement update?

Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [14]

Thanks, Brandon. So in Japan, we do have reimbursement today and there are a couple of things happening. Our distributor is selling systems at a controlled placement model. He is making sure that all of the training is done properly, and he is beginning to conduct our post-market study in the 20 hospitals that we have agreed to do. So there's activity in Japan. It is on a controlled pace

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [15]

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Plovanic with Canaccord

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 William John Plovanic,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Analyst   [16]

Just first, if we could talk about the systems. As you roll them out, how does COVID impact your new account strategy as it relates to the chains versus the independent operators? We've heard some of the larger chains are holding back on some of their capital spend and I don't know if this has adjusted your strategy as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [17]

Good to hear your voice, Bill. We've been in touch with our service providers and their business is growing at this point. So I think our individual psychiatrists and our service providers have put the policies and procedures in place to be able to handle the COVID situation. And so they have their patients wait in the waiting room -- in the car before they bring them in, there's no waiting in the waiting room. So I think that's under control. So I think I had a meeting with Greenbrook's senior leadership team and they are placing systems now. So..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 William John Plovanic,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Analyst   [18]

Okay. So -- but you talked about it a little bit just in your opening remarks regarding kind of the balance of shifting back to the individual operators versus the chains. Is this and then -- but should we expect that there's going to be more focus or more drive into the individual going forward, just to balance it out a little more? Or will it move one way or another, I guess, is what I'm trying to figure out?

Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [19]

Well, I think our business today is about 50-50, and we're providing the same level of help and assistance and awareness to individual psychiatrists as well as the service providers. So I don't think we're trying to shift it in one direction or the other, I think it's in our benefit and theirs to increase treatment sessions to individuals and the providers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 William John Plovanic,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Analyst   [20]

Okay. And then in terms of the treatment sessions. Obviously, you've come back to about $8,100 per system per quarter. And I'm trying to understand if -- to get back to that $10,000, I think you said about 10% of them aren't treating patients. Was there any difference as you went through July and September, October? Are you seeing more and more come on? Because I'm just trying to figure out the cadence of this. And when would you expect to back to 100% of your customers operating?

Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [21]

Yes. That's a good question, Bill. And we just finished up and received October's data, which was extremely impressive and exceeded our own internal expectations. We did see, I would say, a healthy number of sites that had embraced telemedicine restart their TMS platforms in the month of October. And again, we're hopeful that, that momentum can continue through the end of the year. But it was a really strong month

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 William John Plovanic,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Analyst   [22]

So it kind of sounds that some of the guidance provided might just be conservatism, given the -- given what's going on with the third wave of the COVID. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it's just that's kind of the takeaway I'm getting. Is that a fair assessment?

Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [23]

I think that's fair, yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 William John Plovanic,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Analyst   [24]

Okay. And then just last question for me is, on the operating expenses, you've really done an amazing job cutting back the costs and making the cash you have last a long time. And I think that's something that people may have been concerned about and I can see that you've done a great job there. But as we look at Q3, any onetime charges and any of the operating lines that we should think about that might go away in Q4? Or alternatively, given COVID, not as much T&amp;E going on, maybe not as much marketing support that you have had to provide, what have you, where are the lever points in that off-line from both the plus and the minus we should think about as you drive into the end of the year and next year? And that's all my questions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [25]

Yes. Q3, from an expense perspective, was very normal. So no significant out of the ordinary entries. Going forward -- again, so we cut very deeply in April and May and now are, I would say, very strategically adding resources. I don't think you'll ever see us back to where we were from an operating expense perspective anytime soon

And so from a marketing side, a lot of the expenses are being reallocated to different programs. So not necessarily incremental spend. In Q4, I think we'll see some incremental spend as we roll out our programs and new campaigns in 2021. And then from a sales perspective, again, the increases to the team, I would term, is modest. And we're not going to go back to the days of 59 BDMs in 2021. There'll be a handful on both teams

So I think what you saw in Q3, there'll be an uptick in Q4, which is reflective in the guidance. And that will continue into 2021 as we drive growth. We're certainly not going to be in a position to spend ahead of revenue. So we want to make sure that the efforts we put in place in 2020 were valued and we won't get ahead of ourselves

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [26]

Your next question comes from the line of Marie Thibault with BTIG

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Marie Yoko Thibault,  BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Director &amp; Digital Health Analyst   [27]

Maybe I could start with one there on the discussion of adding back modestly to the teams with some new BDM and NPC hires. What's the ideal profile for these positions? Is it different than you've typically hired in the past? And then, I guess, a related question with all these -- a few realignments happening. Keith, could you tell us a little bit about what morale feels like right now at Neuronetics?

Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [28]

Okay. So on the BDM side, we're going to be looking for people that have capital equipment experience, preferably capital equipment that also has a trailing revenue piece

On the NPC side, it's a relationship builder that's able to go into the accounts, gain the trust and be able to walk in and help them through their marketing efforts, train them on how to work with their front desk staff, their consultation of patients and teach them how to do digital and social media and get their practice up and running. So I think the morale in the organization, both inside and outside, is high. I think we have a plan. We have given it to our teams on a very high level. And I think over the next couple of months as we roll it out, I think there'll be a higher level of excitement

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Marie Yoko Thibault,  BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Director &amp; Digital Health Analyst   [29]

That's great to hear. I want to ask a follow-up on the capital equipment side, along the lines of what Bill was asking about. It does sound like some buying have come back from the psychiatric practices. Could you characterize who is buying or who is doing well enough, I guess, at this point to think about equipment sales? And then of the remaining 10% of customers that have stayed close, are they waiting for a vaccine? Or is there some other time line that you consider for them coming back online?

Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [30]

Marie, this is Steve. So with respect to the 10%. And so we did survey our NPCs who contacted the subset of customers directly. And the vaccine was one of the overarching themes. Again, they want to be very responsible for their staff and patients and have really moved away from bringing patients in-house. And so that will continue to be a pressure as we exit Q4 until folks are comfortable with a vaccine if it does come in 2021

In terms of whose purchasing systems. Again, we mentioned in the call that there's not a lot of difference between the number of systems sold to the TMS-only providers and the traditional psychiatrists. We do analyze this data and just to see if we can see any trends. But it's -- the sales in Q3 were really along historical lines. And then even in the month of October where we did a fair amount of system sales, again, those ratios were pretty consistent to what we've seen in the past couple of years

It's not easy for an individual psychiatrist to make the capital equipment purchasing decision in this environment. There's a significant amount of trust and validation that they must go through to acquire a system in this environment. So we continue to support them and the TMS-only providers as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of John Newman with Canaccord

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Lawrence Newman,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Principal &amp; Senior Healthcare Analyst   [2]

It's very interesting. I wondered if you could talk to us a little bit more about what you've learned regarding the inflammatory pathways associated with COVID. And how your asset 195 -- excuse me, 109 can be effective there?

Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [3]

Yes. John, it's Alison. So great question. I think Kate covered it a little bit in her comments, but I'll ask her to comment some more. Just to summarize, there is a number of pieces of evidence in preclinical models showing the link between the microbiome and short-chain fatty acid production. And also, just to remind you, the short-chain fatty acid production is a result of fermentation of glycans in the gut and the link between this and different immune pathways in infections associated with viral respiratory infections

So Kate, maybe you want to talk a little bit more about the evidence that we have, and then we can comment on KB109 characteristics

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Katharine Knobil,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Chief Medical Officer and Head of Research &amp; Development   [4]

Yes. Thanks, Alison. And thanks for your question. We alluded to a lot of the data that we've been looking at recently, looking at the influence of short-chain fatty acids and short-chain fatty acids producing taxa in the gut in preclinical models and also in humans. So just to reiterate, in preclinical models, we've seen that short-chain fatty acids or the taxa that produce them have had a positive impact on the pathology that occurred after influenza virus or RSV in preclinical models and actually has reduced the mortality associated with lethal influenza virus infection in mouse models

It's -- we've also seen that high-fiber diet in these mouse models have reduced the pathology and the subsequent inflammatory reaction in the mice as well, as I mentioned earlier, the function of CD4 and CD8-positive T cell cells in macrophage function. The inappropriate activation of these pathways can also cause increased neutrophil activity that can cause tissue damage, which has also been mitigated by short-chain fatty acids

In humans, the data are really interesting in that in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplants who have been infected with these respiratory viruses, there's been a decrease in the progression of those infections to lower respiratory tract infections. And I think that's really important because in these really vulnerable patient populations, we want to mitigate the activity and the [quality] of this inappropriate immune reaction that we've seen with COVID, and potentially improve the outcomes of these patients and decrease hospitalization

So there's -- we find these data really compelling for the program. And we're looking forward to seeing the results of the studies

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [5]

And John, just to add one more comment. Just to remind you that KB109 is -- we've shown in our ex vivo screen that it increases the production of the ratio of short-chain fatty acids, as well as, of course, driving down the presence of pathogenic bacteria. And so for that reason, we're very excited to have the opportunity to conduct this study, and look at how KB109 can really help the patient's whole own immune system to prevent the pathological implications with the COVID-19 infection

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Lawrence Newman,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - Principal &amp; Senior Healthcare Analyst   [6]

Okay. Great. And then just had a question on the Phase II study for KB195. Obviously, the entire industry has been affected by COVID-19 in terms of running clinical programs that's been difficult for everyone. Just curious, with the 195 program, wondering when you might be able to activate some of the sites that you have set up, and just kind of curious as to how that might move forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [7]

Yes, it's a great question, John. And obviously, all clinical sites have been impacted by COVID-19. And I think that the safety of patients is obviously the priority as far as not bringing patients into hospital and clinical sites where they could be at risk of acquiring the COVID-19 infection. So as you can imagine, the enrollment of patients in our study has suffered as a result of that. So we're working closely with the sites to make sure that as they start opening up, we can start to enroll the patients again. I want to remind you that we actually have approval now across 10 different countries, and we have more than 20 sites where we're enrolling, and patients that will work closely with, as they say, as they start to get back on to some level of normality. So right now, we are anticipating approximately a 6 months or more delay in the enrollment of that study. But we'll be monitoring that closely as the sites get up and started again

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [8]

Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Terence C. Flynn,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - MD   [9]

I was just wondering on KB109, if the current 2 trials could support a potential approval for the treatment of COVID or if additional trials would be required and then maybe you could outline the magnitude of the benefit across the various end points that you're hoping to show in terms of thinking about next steps and what you'd -- what would be an ideal profile for the drug? And then any insight on total cost of the program?

Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [10]

Okay. So I hear 3 questions in there, Terence, one on the potential approval. So let me start there. And what I would say is we are ready for a number of different possible routes forward, depending, really, on the clinical results that we see. We do plan to have a pre-IND meeting with the FDA while these trials are ongoing, so that we have different options depending on the results. I would say that could be anything, for example, from expanding the current clinical studies if we see some signals, but we decide we want to add more patients. It could be working through and ensuring that an IND is filed ready to initiate the Phase III clinical study. What I would also say is, given the safety profile of KB109, if we see signs that -- any signs that look like there's a benefit in these patients, it's a very important patient population to target and avoid these people from meeting to be hospitalized. So we would be ready to work with the FDA at that point and with the potential of opening up an emergency use authorization. So any one of those routes could be a possibility depending on the results that we see

I'm going to hand over to Kate to talk a little bit about what results we're looking at as far as what we would anticipate being important trends

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Katharine Knobil,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Chief Medical Officer and Head of Research &amp; Development   [11]

Yes. So we're measuring a number of endpoints in the study, from clinical end points, patient measured end points as well as biomarkers of the inflammatory response. And so if we see a trend in the right direction in the clinical response, whether it be hospitalizations or even the percentage of patients showing low oxygen level, or if we see a mitigation of the inflammatory response, we would view this as very positive and very helpful for us to move forward with the rest of the program

The other thing is that we will get data from this program, and that will also inform on the capability of KB109 working more broadly, not just in COVID-19, but potentially in other respiratory virus infections, as well as for the impact of MMTs on inflammatory diseases more broadly. So that's what we're hoping to see. And we hope to have these data very quickly

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [12]

Yes. And so coming back, and just to summarize again, Terence. On the opportunity, if we see any benefit, obviously, there's a lot of discussion about is there going to be a second wave of the COVID-19? What about other potential respiratory viral infections? And certainly, if we see a benefit from this clinical study and things moving in the right direction, we will be ready and able to work with the FDA for that fastest route forward. And that also ties in, I think, with your last question around costs because it links directly to manufacturing. And just to remind you again that KB109, like all of our MMTs, it's a synthetic glycan and we actually use small molecule-like processing in our manufacturing. So it's very easy to scale. In fact, with KB195, sorry, our lead program, of course, we've already shown that we've been able to scale efficiently where we did that with our contract manufacturer, Thermo Fisher, in 6 months we scaled that production

So we're confident we can scale manufacturing, and the costs are going to be right in line with kind of the small molecule typical pharmaceutical costs. Mike, I don't know if you want to add any additional comment to that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Michael W. Bonney,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Executive Chair &amp; Office of Ceo   [13]

Thanks, Alison. And appreciate the question, Terence. Look, as Kate mentioned in the prepared remarks, this is a controlled study, but it's also open label. So we'll be able to monitor progress as this goes. And that, I think, will provide a lot of clarity as we interact with both the FDA and make decisions around scaling up beyond this initial trial to have supply of 109 available. So it's an appropriate rate of design from a patient safety standpoint, but it also affords us the opportunity to monitor what kind of response we're seeing. And if it looks positive, that's just articulated on the clinical and/or the biomarkers of immune response, we'll be in a position then to work with our partners to start preproduction, if you will, before the final study data are available

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [14]

Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Connor McGuinness Meehan,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Associate   [15]

This is Connor on for Matthew. So just a couple from us. You touched on them briefly, a couple of them. But could you just comment on current enrollment status for the UCD trial? And I guess, you mentioned that maybe you're likely pushing out enrollment by 6 months, but we were just wondering if you could provide any insight on how enrollment stands at present. And then just on the COVID trial, is there any sort of margin of improvement that you'd be willing to guide on in terms of any of the end points you mentioned that you'd need to see to bring it forward? And then just lastly, can you comment briefly on the profile or pretreatment status of the mild to moderate UC patients in the new KB295 study?

Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [16]

Thanks, Carter. I've got 3 parts, and I just want to clarify. So the first question is around enrollment of UCD. Let me address that first, and then I'll come back to your other 2 questions

So in the enrollment in UCD, we're not providing details at this point of how many patients have been enrolled. And we're guiding on 6 months -- that's what we're anticipating as far as the sites being able to come back online and start enrolling. And of course, the patients that we have enrolled and we have data on so far, will be added to the pool of the additional patients that we plan to continue to enroll

I do want to also just remind or mention again that we've expanded enrollment with an amendment to expand the age group so that we are confident, when we start that enrollment, it should go smoothly

The second question I have, Carter, is around the margin of improvement in the different clinical symptoms. And I think it's really difficult to say any single one that we would expect to see certain cutoffs as far as improvements. I think that like many of these clinical studies, it's going to be looking across a broad range. And as the FDA would say, looking at the totality of the evidence and seeing trends in the right direction for many of those different things, including, I think, importantly, the biomarkers of inflammation along with trends in some of the clinical signs and symptoms that we're going to be recording

And then the third question I have, I'd actually ask you to repeat, please, Carter, because I heard you mentioned KB295 and UC. But I wasn't completely clear on the question. And I apologize, I just realized I've been calling you Carter instead of Connor

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Connor McGuinness Meehan,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research Associate   [17]

No worries at all. I get it more often than you might think. So we were just wondering on the pretreatment status of patients that you plan to enroll in the UC 295 study?

Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [18]

Okay. I'll ask Kate to comment on that one. Thanks, Connor. Got it right that time

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Katharine Knobil,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Chief Medical Officer and Head of Research &amp; Development   [19]

These are patients who are not yet on biologic therapy, so they can be 5-ASA or [in some mean] or ages like that, but not severe to require biologics

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [20]

Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Fye with JPMorgan

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Daniel G. Wolle,  JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Analyst   [21]

This is Daniel for Jessica Fye. On the COVID-19 studies, can you elaborate -- can you walk us through the decision to evaluate clinical outcomes following 2 weeks of treatment? What gives you the confidence that those 2 weeks of treatment is sufficient to translate into that clinical benefit?

Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [22]

Yes, sure. Kate, do you want to comment on that?

Katharine Knobil,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Chief Medical Officer and Head of Research &amp; Development   [23]

Yes. So we, specifically, not only are looking at the 2 weeks of treatment but also 3 weeks of follow-up because we know that the course of COVID-19 can be several weeks. What we wanted to do was to make sure that we treated patients during the more inflammatory phase of their disease. And so we're going to be looking at those inflammatory markers, both after treatment and during the follow-up, and also looking at their recovery and whether or not they require extra care. So I think 5 weeks is going to be enough for us to be able to see a difference

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [24]

And I would also add that we know, with our MMTs, that we see a change in the microbiome -- the production of the microbiome metabolites of (inaudible) very quickly after starting dosing. And so in that 2-week period, we would certainly anticipate seeing a change in the short-chain fatty acid profile that we're looking for to impact the immune system. And the 2 weeks, of course, is what we also know about the course of the disease as far as that's a critical period from testing before patients may end up in the hospitals. And so with the goal again of treating in that period, to avoid the consequences and avoid patients from going into the hospitals, which is where the real need is in the system, I think we have confidence that KB109 for that duration of treatment has the opportunity to show an effect

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Daniel G. Wolle,  JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Analyst   [25]

Got it. On the KB174 program, with prior expectations for study starts in second half '20, which now seems to be contingent upon finding a partner, is it fair to say that you have already initiated partnership discussions? And why now instead of waiting after getting more data? And if you could elaborate, what type of partnerships are you looking for?

Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [26]

Yes. So you were cut off just as you started that question, but I think it relates to KB174 and hepatic encephalopathy program. So as you know, Daniel, we had very positive results in a clinical study that we reported at the -- I think it was in December now or early January, I forget, the time has gone by so quickly. But that was in cirrhosis patients where we showed that we were able to reduce the production of ammonia by the microbiome, which was a very important study to show with KB174 as well as show the safety of it. As a result, we had a number of parties interested in following up on discussions. And we are, like, continuing those potential discussions with partners. And at this point, we believe that, that's the best path forward. I don't want to comment any further at this point around speculating what that may look like. Mike, I think you may have a comment to add here as well?

Michael W. Bonney,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Executive Chair &amp; Office of Ceo   [27]

Yes. Thank you, Alison. I just wanted to raise -- remind everyone, that given the current crisis that we're in, this decision really is one of convenience, in that it is -- given our frameworks, a lot of uncertainty of what's going to happen with COVID-19 in the developed world, et cetera, right? So we all acknowledge that there's uncertainty here. It wouldn't be possible to enroll patients in this study currently that we have designed this next study simply in order to protect these patients with failing livers from undue exposure to COVID-19. Given that, plus the interest that has attended to partnering this program subsequent to the delivery of the data in the cirrhotic patients that Alison identified, it just made sense to us to gate the start of this study, which we're very excited about on achieving this partnership, and that also will allow the -- hopefully, the health care system to start rebounding to the point where it's safe for patients with failing livers, who are otherwise not having acute illness, to come into a center and be -- started in the study and monitored appropriately and so forth

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Daniel G. Wolle,  JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Analyst   [28]

All right. And one more question. On 295, one of the assessments was the impact on Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index. Why not also look at the Mayo -- the live side of the Mayo score?

Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [29]

Yes. Kate, would you like to comment on that for us?

Katharine Knobil,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Chief Medical Officer and Head of Research &amp; Development   [30]

Yes. So there are a number of scores out there that we could use to simplify. Activity score is actually well correlated with the Mayo score. And so we feel confident that it will be a very good instrument for us to use in this study

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [31]

Our next question comes from the line of Gbola Amusa with Chardan

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Samuel Lee;Chardan;Analyst,    [32]

This is Sam Lee on behalf Gbola. I have a couple of questions and a follow-up, and some of them actually have been answered a little bit already. But number one, can you provide some color on the rationale behind the protocol amendments for 195, expanding the range from -- age range from 12 to 70 -- to 12 to 70, I'm sorry, from 18 to 65? Is that COVID-19 related?
 And two, for the Phase II UNLOCKED trial in KB195 in UCD, do you find that the COVID-19 pandemic is disrupting the collection and/or the quality of the endpoints in any way? In other words, the fasting plasma ammonia and the 24-hour plasma ammonia and under the curve end points

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [33]

Okay. Thanks for the question. So first of all, let me start with your question around the age range for the protocol for the UNLOCKED study. It has always been our intention to expand the age range. As you probably know, a number of patients with UCDs involve and include children and adolescents and infants. And so as we've collected sufficient data required, we've had the opportunity to submit the amendment and expand that age range. So that was always our intention. And it's just fortuitous, if you like, as far as timing, ready for enrolling that broader age group once we are able to start enrollment, again, at the clinical sites

With regards to the collection of endpoint plasma ammonia, for example, as you can imagine, this is one of the issues with patients coming into sites and, really, collection of blood samples. We've been doing a lot of work in looking at how we can do more remote monitoring and visits and collection of blood samples. And so all of that has been part of our consideration in thinking about getting the study up and running again as soon as the sites can be started

As you can imagine, in the COVID-19 environment and the clinical studies, there are many different options in looking at kind of nurses doing home visits instead of asking patients to come into sites, those types of things

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Samuel Lee;Chardan;Analyst,    [34]

Right, of course. I guess to follow up on that for these clinical programs. In addition to that, what other measures are being taken to keep the trials running? You mentioned maybe potentially nurse visits and such. But would the patients still need to visit the sites at all? And have there been any FDA discussions to adjust the trial design? And if so, how so?

Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [35]

So I'll maybe ask Kate to comment further on any adjustments to the study. There have not been any discussions with the FDA to adjust the trial design other than the amendment that we have made to expand the age range for enrollment criteria. But Kate, maybe you want to talk about some of the work that we've been doing to facilitate patients enrolling once we get up and started again

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Katharine Knobil,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Chief Medical Officer and Head of Research &amp; Development   [36]

Yes. And just to reiterate, to make this study as easy on patients as possible, we started out the study with as much remote visits -- as many remote visits as we could because we knew that, that could potentially be a burden. And we're currently looking into ways to provide even more remote monitoring as we open up. So we will be looking at whether or not there requires any further conversations with the FDA, but we know from guidance that these kinds of changes are well within the realm of things that we can do

I just wanted to -- the other thing is that you asked a question about the quality of the end points that we're collecting. There's been no impact on the quality of the endpoints that we've been measuring in this study due to COVID-19. I just wanted to make that clear

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [37]

And maybe I'll just make one more comment. Again, because we have clinical sites across 10 different countries, we have the opportunity for different sites to start at different times as different countries is at different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Samuel Lee;Chardan;Analyst,    [38]

Got it. And one more final question. In terms of the nonclinical programs, immuno-oncology and cardio-metabolic liver diseases, you did mention guidance that they should still be on track. But I'm just wondering how you guys are facilitating the benchmark in terms of continuing it during the pandemic and how you're adjusting

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [39]

Yes. No, it's a great question. And we have worked very closely with the -- our partners, both at Gustave Roussy, who did close down for a little while in Paris. And we know that they're planning to get up and started again. We've been working very closely and coordinating with them and our other laboratories who've been doing this work. We've also initiated some animal work at other sites, as China was coming back online much faster than some of the other countries. We took the opportunity to make sure we had backup plans and animal work starting in China so that we could ensure we are on track here

So I think with the understanding of where we are, working closely with our partners and contractors in the labs on this, as well as knowing that the good stuff we see matter are coming back online, we have confidence that we can deliver this data still in Q4 of this year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [40]

Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer section. I would now like to turn the call back to Alison Lawton for closing remarks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [41]

Thank you, and thanks for some great questions there and for joining us on the call this morning. While the first quarter posed unexpected and unprecedented challenges for us as it did for most companies, I have to say I'm very proud of the team and their flexibility and dedication and commitment to our science as well as ensuring that our clinical trials and development programs have been able to continue to evolve. And I'm particularly excited about this opportunity that we have to be part of the broader endeavor to better understand the cause of COVID-19, and how we might moderate the course of the disease with the goal of easing the burden on the health care system and the hospitals as well as, of course, potential future serious viral respiratory infections, more broadly

So I'd like to conclude by thanking the patients and their families, our investigators and clinicians who've been involved in all of our clinical studies, as well as our great team here at Kaleido for making it all possible. And have a great day, everybody. Thank you

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jeff Fan with Scotia Bank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director, Telecommunication Services and Canadian and U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [2]

Congrats on the subscriber numbers. Wanted to touch on that a little bit. It sounds like some of the early success has been driven by lower churn on both video and Internet. Wondering if that's going to change in terms of shifting to more -- better gross adds going forward. Wondering how that mix is going to evolve as we go through the expansion of BlueSky and WideOpen. And wondering if you can just help us with thinking about how well BlueSky actually is doing within that base and how much it's contributed to the subscriber results as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [3]

Jeff, it's Jay. The -- thanks for the question. I think what you're seeing as the plan is unfolding is we started with -- I mean, at a high level, our plan on the Consumer business was absolutely service agreements first; WideOpen Internet 150, next; and BlueSky is the third piece of the puzzle. And so as that flowed through the system, you've seen the benefits of each of those initiatives take hold in the plan. And for sure, the initial benefits were on churn, as you wisely described. Since the beginning of April, we're now very much in all of our services available to all of our customers, which is a significant, competitive advantage, and that has really turned the story to much more of a gross add story. So we saw significantly better gross adds in Q3. And we're excited about the -- both the prospects for gross adds in Q4 but also the quality of the gross adds being driven by the combination of the 3 parts of the computer -- of the consumer strategy: Service agreements, WideOpen Internet 150 and BlueSky. BlueSky is a big part of that story. I mean, it's a video product that's without peers in the marketplace. It's raising -- it's very much the tide that's raising all boats. And I think if you look at the results and the reaction that the product has got, certainly in the Comcast markets and in Cox markets, we're seeing lots of the same things here, Jeff

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director, Telecommunication Services and Canadian and U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [4]

If I may just follow on. So certainly, the bundles and the service agreements and this -- the new services on BlueSky is working well. How satisfied are you guys with the financial impact of these bundles? And I guess, as we look out to the next number of quarters and the next year, your service contracts has a pretty good uptick in ARPU in year 2. Should we start to expect some of that ARPU to contribute to the financial results as you go into the second year of some of those bundles?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP   [5]

Jeff. It's Vito. Maybe I'll take that. I mean first of all, the way we account our 2-year plans is, in the year, we effectively smooth the ARPU over the 2 years. So related exclusively to the 2-year plan, as it's structured, you shouldn't expect to see an ARPU lift related to it. Clearly a little bit of margin pressure on the Consumer business relative to year ago. We're very, very happy with the positive RGU momentum and really allows us to rebase our customers in something that they're we're happy with and what they want. And I think as we head into F '18, allows to continue to optimize that, both from a customer value proposition, but also from a profitably perspective. Focus clearly is on the revenue and RGUs at this time. The Q3 results versus year ago do reflect, obviously, increased commercial spend and the effect of increased promotional spend primarily related to those 2-year value plans versus year ago. So all leaning in very much heavily into, obviously, the strategic growth drivers that Jay described earlier

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [6]

The next question is from Drew McReynolds, RBC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst   [7]

The first question for you, just Vito, when we look at your balance sheet post all the transactions, obviously, one of the best now in the industry. Just wondering if you can just provide an update on the extent to which you're happy where you are with leverage and maybe the free cash flow priorities going forward. And probably tied to that, second question just on wireless CapEx. I think probably given all the moving parts you're putting together on wireless, there's the expectation that we'll see an increase in wireless CapEx going forward as you grow the business. Just wondering if you can give us an update on, for modeling purposes, what we should be penciling in for maintenance CapEx, whether it's an intensity data point or something else. So essentially excluding the LTE upgrade and excluding the $350 million in spectrum deployment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP   [8]

Yes. You're absolutely right, obviously, with respect to the balance sheet. We absolutely love our flexibility. As we sit here, we're assuming the completion of these 2 transactions, obviously. And after payment for the spectrum, our leverage will be, as I said, in the low 2s. Actually under 2, and at least how we calculate it. And fully undrawn revolver. So tons of flexibility. As far as priority, Drew, clearly building on our wireless network and capital investment in our strategic. And basically establishing the converged network we talk about is really the priority. We'll probably come back in our fall meeting with maybe a little bit more color on what we -- what that looks like as it relates to F '18. As it relates to wireless, I think what we said in the past is 15% to 20% is a good barometer on your maintenance cap. And as you saw us in our release, we indicated a $350 million incremental CapEx related to effect the enabling of the newly acquired spectrum, the majority of which we expect -- plans are still in development, but the majority of which, we expect to be -- to fall into F '18

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [9]

Our next question is from Greg MacDonald, Macquarie

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Gregory William MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Head of Equity Research of Canada   [10]

Question is on post-ViaWest sale. And so what I'm really wondering is what, if any, impact is the sale of ViaWest going to have on the Canadian data center business, the prospects for overall growth in that business segment?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [11]

Yes. Thanks, Greg. It's Jay. We continue to maintain ownership of the data center in Calgary, Calgary 1, under the management agreement with the super strong ViaWest team. I think if you look at our focus on Shaw Business, it's been -- had incredible clarity at the small and medium-sized business model. And we're going to continue to have that focus. Is there an opportunity to come off market into some of the products and with the partnership with ViaWest? For sure there is. And it's an exciting opportunity. It's not job 1 for us on Shaw Business, but it's absolutely still part of the story

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Gregory William MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Head of Equity Research of Canada   [12]

Okay. And then overall, Jay, what do you consider the growth prospects there? The data points on the Western economy have kind of come and gone. Most recently feels like a gone in terms of the -- I don't want to use that word literally, but the energy price being more depressed than it was 6 months ago. What's the mood like within the business customer base and your outlook there?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [13]

Yes. We're quite positive on our outlook in the small and medium base in Western Canada. Our performance results in this calendar year have been good in Alberta. And some of that's where we are in the cycle and some of that is maybe that folks are moving on and who are carrying on with business. And it's been a hard few years for sure. Remember, we save businesses money. We -- some of this actually helps us in the small and medium-size business space. And the small and medium-size businesses that are still around in Western Canada are here because they're price-sensitive and they understand the value of money. And so we're a place for them to look to in this marketplace

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Gregory William MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Head of Equity Research of Canada   [14]

All right. I appreciate that. Can I ask one final one on wireless? ARPU looks like it ticked up in the quarter. Can we attribute that to anything? Is that just assumed more customers coming in on the LTE network? Is there something else going on there? And any updates on devices beyond the Samsung family would be helpful as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [15]

Yes. ARPU did tick up. I think it's just the continued execution of our plan. To be clear, we had -- the growth was postpaid, not prepaid, in the quarter. And as you understand, our postpaid LTE base has a higher ARPU than some of our historical base. So all of those things are positive for the future. We think the handset ecosystem is coming along nicely. We're excited to have the Samsung device and other devices available today. We think everything else is coming with the course and speed that's largely expected in terms of handsets being made available on band 66. We don't have any announcements to make today, but we're optimistic about the handset ecosystem continuing. And we're excited about adding -- I mean, this is -- the wireless business for us is about long-term value creation. And as you've heard us say before, adding prepaid customers to the 3G base isn't really a big part of that story. And so you'll see us continue to focus on LTE on postpaid and growing the high-value part of the business

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Gregory William MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Head of Equity Research of Canada   [16]

And does that optimism extend into potential iPhone contracts? What's your messaging on iPhone?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [17]

Nobody underestimates the importance of the iPhone to the marketplace. And we anticipate, like others, announcements about iPhones that work in band 66

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [18]

Our next question is from Aravinda Galappatthige with Canaccord Genuity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Suranimala Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD   [19]

With respect to the consumer margins, I was wondering if you can help us out. If you kind of look in the near term, you obviously have sort of the extra costs around the BlueSky rollout and obviously payments to Comcast advertising, et cetera, as well as, obviously, the promotional discounts. Is it -- is the more reasonable view to take that your consumer margins will probably see a little bit of a pressure in the next couple of quarters before we start to see sort of the benefits of these stronger subscriber results that you're posting?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP   [20]

Yes. It's Vito, Aravinda. I think you've -- I think that's an accurate description of what you can expect to see. And it's pretty consistent with what we've been saying over the last couple of quarters that really, the focus, of course, is taking advantage of our position with our products that Jay described at the outset here and moving forward through that. Your Q3 margin compression compared to, obviously, prior quarter and prior year, more of the prior year, reflects a lot of those spend aspects that you're describing that we believe, from a value-creation perspective, are enhancing to our overall portfolio and our product set

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Suranimala Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD   [21]

And just as a follow-up to that on the -- in terms of sort of the competitive landscape. Obviously, you're starting to gain momentum on both on the Internet front and on the video front. What are you seeing competitively in response to your sort of promotional offers? And is there anything -- has there been any new developments over the last month or so that's sort of noteworthy that's maybe a little bit more aggressive than anticipated? Or something of that sort?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [22]

I mean, we operate in an extremely competitive environment. And the kind of market shifts that you're seeing are hard. It's clear that everybody's fighting for a share of the changing consumer experience. And we're excited about the go-to-markets that we're bringing to market and the value that it provides to consumers. I think it's been well reported, some of the innovations that others are bringing to market. And we're both -- all of the competitors are playing to their primary strength, and I think you'll see us probably both do that. In the last month or 2, it hasn't gotten any easier, but we've got a strategy and we're focused on our strategy and we're going to continue to execute

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Non Independent Director   [23]

I just wanted to take the opportunity to thank all of the Shaw employees as well. When you talk about margin compression, the team is doing a tremendous job around efficiencies and effectiveness across our entire organization. And that doesn't go unrecognized. And we're hitting our targets there, and that helps, obviously, as we're working through this transformation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [24]

The next question is from Tim Casey with BMO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Equity Research Analyst   [25]

Just wanted to revisit a couple of items on wireline. Just in terms -- Vito, is there any onetimers in the quarter or in the previous year that would affect the comp? Or is that revenue and margin run rate, is that -- that’s just reflective of the items you talked about in terms of investing in the consumer experience and some promotional activity? And also, on the last call, Jay, you were very forthright about returning to positive growth on subs, and obviously, you've delivered on that. Are you equally confident that you can sustain that over the next several quarters? Do you think you've turned the trend here? Or do you think there may be a bit of volatility on those -- in those subscriber numbers going forward?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP   [26]

Yes. Tim, I mean, there are some onetimers, quite frankly, going through -- and as there always are on G&amp;A-related items. But I think the primary story on the Consumer results are what we've described, which is the increased investment in our portfolio and in our products. And so I wouldn't overstate the onetimers. I think based on the discussions we've had, that's what I'd go forward with

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [27]

Yes. And in terms of the trajectory on subscribers, Tim, I think what I hope you're seeing in the quarter is a plan coming to life. And it's step-by-step. We talked about service agreements. We talked about the broadband advantage available to every customer in the market through WideOpen Internet 150. And we've talked about BlueSky, not only in terms of what BlueSky is today, but the road map that it makes possible for consumers as we continue to evolve that experience. There is no question that we see that going forward, winning looks like executing that plan, and that plan includes positive video subs. We had a great quarter because we had a launch. And we'd love to continue to perform at levels like this. It's hard out there. There's competitive responses and things that are happening back and forth. But there's no question, we've got an entire team that's focused on growing the wireline and wireless business. And on the wireline business, that includes video growth

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [28]

Our next question is from Maher Yaghi with Desjardins Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [29]

I wanted to ask you about the $350 million CapEx in fiscal year '18 that you mentioned is to deploy the new spectrum that you bought from Quebecor. Can you maybe just explain what extent of this investment will mean in terms of improvement in your network? Is it going to be used to expand the network or just to upgrade the network in utilizing the new spectrum in the same geography that you currently cover?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [30]

Maher, it's Jay. I'll start in terms of the benefit. Our focus today is we're excited to be able to add low-band spectrum to the mix. It's an important part of our plan. And just as we've talked about our step-by-step approach on wireline, I hope you're seeing us taking a step-by-step approach on wireless with the LTE build, the additional low-band spectrum, the things we've talked about in terms of the handset ecosystem coming online over the next year. To be clear, the $350 million CapEx is adding low-band spectrum to the markets that we serve. So it's about in-building coverage, it's about metro coverage and really focusing on our existing markets in Ontario and Edmonton, Calgary and Metro Vancouver in -- as the priority. Over time, we've got other markets built into the plan that we're going to be focused on, but the intensity here is to build a much more compelling product in markets that we currently serve. We think we've got room to grow in the markets we currently serve

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [31]

For sure. And I do want to have just a more discussion on that. When you look at your coverage, network coverage area, and when we look at your potential fiscal year '18 CapEx, without getting into the specifics, are the $350 million, should we see them as an addition to what you have been investing in 2017? Or a different type of investment? Basically, I'm looking at the LTE upgrade, basically. Is that going to be on top of the LTE upgrade? Is that -- what is maintenance CapEx that we should be assuming in fiscal year '18?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP   [32]

Yes. It's Vito here. I mean, this is not in addition to the LTE spend. So I think as -- we'll come back in October, as I said, and give a little bit more color. But I think it's fair for you to take our F '17 $1.350 billion and remove $150 million, roughly, of LTE spend there and use that as sort of the base and then move forward from there. But the $350 million is exclusively related to what Jay described, and there will be other components as we build forth and continue to build our plans. But -- and work through the capital plan. And with regard to maintenance, I think 15% to 20% is a good number in relation to your maintenance assumption outside of the $350 million

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [33]

The next question is from David McFadgen with Cormark

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David John McFadgen,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Director of Institutional Equity Research   [34]

Just on wireless. I was a little surprised, positively surprised, at the wireless EBITDA growth in the quarter. Was there any onetime items in there? Or this is a good sort of level to model for the cost structure going forward?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP   [35]

Yes. I think margins maybe got a little bit ahead of themselves there in Q3. Overall, we're obviously really pleased with our Q3 wireless results. When you look at the EBITDA of $42 million from the wireless business, $13 million of that was driven -- $13 million higher than prior year. The majority of that was driven by increased subscribers and coupled with, obviously, smaller gains in ARPU. We did have some timing differences and related to some commercial marketing and advertising-related spend and other G&amp;A-related items, so I would guide you more to our year-to-date margin in the neighborhood of 23% to 24%, perhaps, as a barometer going forward, at least in the short term

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David John McFadgen,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Director of Institutional Equity Research   [36]

Okay. And if I can just squeeze in just a question on CapEx. Can we assume that the core cable side of the business CapEx is just going to continue as it is right now? It's not going to change much for 2018, is it?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP   [37]

Well, I think, again, that it gets really difficult to start separating core network versus wireless because as we're going through all of this, it's really how do we leverage all of our assets into the converged network, quite frankly. So I don't think there's any nasty surprises as we lean into next year relative to our F '17 base on network. But as I said, maybe we'll come back in the fall and give you a little bit more color on that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [38]

(Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Adam Ilkowitz with Citi

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adam Todd Ilkowitz,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Associate    [39]

Jay, you were at a conference recently talking about your prior wireless plan and potentially getting to 2 million subscribers. I was wondering if you can kind of help us out thinking about what the updated wireless plan might look like over a near to medium term so we can kind of see what you guys are thinking about in terms of the subscriber growth over that time period. And then just in the quarter specifically, can you help us understand the churn versus gross additions on the postpaid side? Are you seeing any impacts on either side to drive that net add number?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [40]

Great. Well, let me start, and then I'll let Vito talk about the wireless churn number. We wanted to be clear we bought a business with an existing business plan that was a value player and was originally built on the fourth player model. And it was all about executing that plan and bringing it into the marketplace. I think it's clear with our recent investments in spectrum and the way that we're thinking about the wireless business that we're thinking about it with ambition and aspiration. We think Canadians deserve a choice and their choice is not provided by the big 3. And I think you'll see us behave that way as we move forward. That having been said, just as you've seen us do on wireline, where we've built the strategy, we’ve built partnerships, we've put the plan in place and we've created winning conditions to execute in the marketplace, I think you'll see us do the same thing on wireless. And you've heard us talk about our plan is we're moving forward. We're -- it'll be another year or so till we get all of the pieces in place that we'll be able to be meaningful player in some of the spaces that we're not a meaningful player in today. But we're a company that's prepared to make those investments. And there is no doubt for us that there's a space in Canada and in the markets that we serve, a position for a company worried about the consumer, worried about the opportunity to do things a little bit differently. And if you hear that in our ambitions, then I think that's the right message

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP   [41]

I'll just add to that, Jay. I mean, churn was a -- we are very, very pleased with the churn in Q3. We don't release churn-specific numbers. But as I look at the last several quarters, it was our best churn number, our lowest churn number, in quite some time, which I think obviously connects to our LTE network. And the quality of a network, the handset environment as we see that coming in. Obviously early days, but I think those are all contributing to improved churn. And we expect that to continue

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [42]

Mr. Shaw, there are no more questions at this time. This concludes..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Non Independent Director   [43]

Okay, operator, thank you very much. And thanks, everyone. And look forward to -- have a great summer. And we'll talk to you in October

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) The first question is from Vince Valentini of TD Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [2]

One question on cable, and one on wireless, if I could. So on the cable side, your guidance for 2018 clearly implies that things will bounce back. I'm wondering if you can flush that out a little bit more. Is that mostly just the increased subscriber volumes you have flowing through or do you anticipate a deliberate move back to more a, what I'd call normal, promotional behavior with less than 12 months at the discounted price and perhaps more normal advertising budget at some point? And would you care to comment on approximately when you think you'd make that shift? And on wireless, congrats on the Apple deal, and your release -- your separate release today says you'll have the vast majority of existing LTE devices compatible with your network. Can you give us a little more color there on exactly when that happens and what devices you were talking about? Is that sort of all the -- the old iPhones, the 7s, the 6s, the SE, and then the old Galaxy devices? Are those all compatible with your network? And if so, when?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [3]

Great, thanks, Vince. It's Jay, and I'll start with the wireless, and a little bit of color on cable, and then Vito can help with some more detail on guidance. Yes, in terms of wireless, we're excited about the next steps. To your specific question, as we reallocate our spectrum from markets launching near the end of this calendar year and some early next calendar year for Bring Your Own Device, we are going to support successfully all of the Apple devices you listed, the Samsung Galaxy you listed, and the vast majority of LTE devices. In simple terms, an LTE device that works in AWS-1 will be a Bring Your Own Device opportunity for Freedom. And I think you can appreciate that's a major shift for us since we build out our LTE network. So your assumption is right. All those phones will work, which is great news. In terms of cable, yes, I think you -- look, we decided that we are going to purposefully shift the RGU environment after many, many years of not having success in the marketplace. And we're clear that we did what was required, including investments in marketing and cost of goods sold and some discounting. I think if you looked at our approach this year, it's going to be a more balanced approach as we kind of pivot from share to share of wallet. And you'll see that throughout the year. You'll see Q1 will look not all that dissimilar to Q4, and then as the year unfolds, we'll see significant improvement. Some of the moves you are anticipating in the marketplace, you'll probably see, but I don't know that it's helpful for us to give you specific timing. Do you want to add?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP   [4]

Yes, thanks, Jay. I think, Vince, the way you've characterized and the way Jay characterized is accurate. When you look at the back half of 2017, you see an increased cost profile. And I think the 2018, you will see sequential improvement in bottom line results and year-over-year comparison. And that's driven by the timing of the cost both in 2017 and as we head into 2018. And the effect of the revenue base. The revenue, you talk about the RGUs and how they flow through, the pricing opportunities and also the promotional plans. I mean, I think the only thing outside that is when you look at our Internet, in particular, we really see a continued opportunity to migrate customers and people love the value of our packaging and the [congestion] of the network is amazing. It's a real strong opportunity for us to expand that revenue pool as we move through

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [5]

Our next question comes from Drew McReynolds of RBC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst   [6]

Maybe one for you, Vito. Just on the CapEx guidance, just to break kind of the bucket down a little bit. Can you give us some color just in and around what's going on with the cable CapEx side, just as you had continued to deploy X1? And just on the wireless side, I think you alluded to -- or for spending $350 million to deploy that Quebecor spectrum in the market. Can you kind of quantify how much of that is included in the fiscal '18 guidance?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP   [7]

Yes. Maybe I'll start and then, Jay, you can pick up as well. I mean, when you look at the increase year-over-year, the $1,225 million to the $1,380 million that we're projecting, that increase clearly leans on wireless. We're clearly focused on prudent and efficient spend with a view to significantly advancing our converged network platform and really enabling us to profitably offer value-enhancing products as we move forward. Specifically, on the wireline side, the spend will reflect, I'll say, consistent levels of aggregate spend as in F '17 and focused on -- remains on really maintaining our broadband leadership in key markets, and managing both growth and future-proofing our network with fiber deeper. On the wireless side, clearly the F '18 spend reflects investments in both our new and refarming the existing spectrum, but pursuant to the release this morning. And in addition, we will have -- we don't want to -- more macro and small cells and a whole bunch of other components, but we're taking a bit of incremental approach. Don't want to leave the community with a view that the 13 75 necessarily reflects the full deployment of 700 MHz and 2500 MHz, but we think that's the best use of our capital as we move forward. Jay, anything else you want to add? Are you good with that?

Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst   [8]

Thanks, Vito. If I can just kind of squeeze one additional one in here. On the wireless strategy. Interesting announcement this morning in terms of Mike Sievert joining the board. You are couple of years into the wireless process. Can you just kind of comment relative to when you started down wireless, has your kind of strategy changed materially? Do you think with Mike coming on board that from a strategic standpoint that, that changes at all going forward?

Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Non Independent Director   [9]

Drew, it's Brad. No, I don't think so. I think, Mike certainly brings a wealth of wireless knowledge, operations, marketing. And as I said earlier, Canada is a bit different than U.S. and it has different dynamics and a different type of market. And so we need to be responsible into that and make sure we're sensitive to that. But he is going to be a great asset for the board and the family, and we're very privileged to have him. But we wouldn't see anything changing in the strategy

Our next question comes from Jeff Fan of Scotiabank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director, Telecommunication Services and Canadian and U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [11]

Just a couple of follow-ups. One, regarding the device lineup. So will you have deployed the low band spectrum as you launch these devices with the iPhone. So I guess, the question is, is it just going to work on the 2500 MHz and some of the refarmed AWS-1? Or there will be low band that's compatible with some of the older devices, older Apple devices? And then the second question is related to just the CapEx. It's great that you guys gave some guidance for '18, but if we look out -- how much do you think the network will be at a place that will allow you to rebrand wireless in [the West] with Shaw after '18 CapEx is done? And can you give us some direction as to what maybe F '19 may look like, given your plans?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [12]

Great. Thanks, Jeff. Let me start in and then Vito can help with some comments on F '19 CapEx. Maybe I'll start with just refreshing our wireless strategy, so that we have clarity and then I'll deal with your specific questions about it. We're taking a step-by-step approach to our wireless business. The first step is, as you are well aware, is we needed to build a LTE-A data-only network, and we've done that and it's working great. The next step was to make it available for Canadians. We're competing with the big 3 who've had the benefit of voice networks that they've built over a 25-year head start. And if we were going to compete as the junior member of the big 4 with the same pricing and packaging as the big 3, I don't think we would have been successful. Quite frankly, our LTE network works great for data and [license] of Big Gig is our way of offering that network to Canadians. So that's Step 2. Step 3 is really creating a handset ecosystem that's available to our customers, which the addition of the iPhone helps a lot and Pixel 2 and now Samsung. We've come a long way and as we launch all those products, I think we'll have handset ecosystem parity. Step 4 is the ability to open up our LTE network, which is a fantastic network to the vast majority of LTE devices, which we're doing through the spectrum refarming, some markets this year -- this calendar year, some markets next. Step 5 is to complete the new spectrum, which will include meaningfully investments in 2500 MHz and 700 MHz this year and certainly some investments as Vito will talk about in F '19. Step 6 is voice-over-LTE and really then bringing that data network to voice. We haven't done anything to improve our 3G voice network. And that's it. And then Step 7 is likely 600 MHz. So while I think -- as you think through the model, I hope you see us taking a very methodical approach to adding value to Canadians and stepping into our lineup. I'll let Vito talk about capital in '19

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP   [13]

Yes, Jeff, thanks for the question. I don't know that we really want to get into F '19 capital and give too much guidance around that at this point, because obviously our plans are fluid. I think what Jay's outlined is very, very clear as far as how we're thinking about the steps. I think, Jay, fair to say that's probably an 18- to 24-month path that you just charted there. And we really believe we have a bit of once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here as we step into the wireless side of things, which will -- obviously continuing to support our wireline, but expand the addressable market. Capital decisions, Jeff, aren't necessarily made in isolation. Obviously, we will be looking for EBITDA growth as we move forward here and keeping an eye on the free cash flow. But I think what I can say about F '19 is, as you look at F '18, probably reasonable to assume that we don't have a significant differential as far as on the upside. While at the same time, I don't think there is a step-down coming off of our F '18 projected levels

Our next question comes from Phillip Huang from Barclays

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst   [15]

Maybe just go back to device one last time. Just to clarify with the refarming of your AWS-1 by early 2018 across your entire footprint, does that mean the older iPhones such as the 6s and 7 will also work on LTE across your footprint?

Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Non Independent Director   [16]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst   [17]

Okay, that's great. And then quick follow-up on the cable side. Very strong Internet this quarter. TV growth appears to have slowed a bit from last quarter despite some of the marketing and increased consumer awareness of BlueSky TV. Just trying to better understand the difference there, do you typically get more Internet-only subscribers in your fiscal Q4? Are you seeing a little bit more seasonality to the TV growth than Internet?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [18]

Yes, great, thank you. Look, we're excited by the RGU turnaround we had in our wireline business and very, very pleased with our results. That having been said, I think a number of quarters ago we talked about sort of positive video, plus-one video being what winning looks like. And I think we achieved that for the fiscal year. I don't know that there is a lot of advantage driving beyond that, and I'm not sure that we're going to necessarily have a video gain every single quarter. If you look at the big 3 opportunities for our business, by far, the biggest growth opportunity as we've become an EBITDA growth story is wireless. The second biggest opportunity is probably small and medium business. And the third biggest opportunity is broadband and driving broadband revenues. And recognizing the math on 2 and 3 are probably are about the same. So where they fit in the weighting. We think we are super excited about where we are in the video space, and we've got a great offering. As we pivot to a more profitable approach, you might see us -- even give us a few video subs back, potentially in Q1. And I think that we should be able to grow video in the long run. To be clear, video is a tough business and there isn't simple answers to what's happening in the video space today. And you won't see us over chase RGUs at the expense of profitability

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [19]

Our next question comes from Greg MacDonald of Macquarie

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Gregory William MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Head of Equity Research of Canada   [20]

The question is on wireless subs and mostly I'm looking for a description of the profile, the new subs being added on. It was a decent number, 41,000k (sic) [41,000]. Can you talk little bit about to post-pre -- sorry the post and prepaid mix and the ARPU, more importantly the ARPU mix in the quarter?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP   [21]

Fairly consistent, Greg, I mean, we were pleased with the mix of -- maybe just give us a couple of seconds here and I can grab the number for you. ARPU, obviously, we like where people are coming on as we look at our Big Gig plan. I mean we had a, obviously, a sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement and a year-over-year improvement. And the early take on the Big Data, very, very early, we like what's happening. So as we look into F '18, the -- everybody is contributing to our 5% guidance, right. When we look at the businesses, Wireless, Wireline, BNS, Consumer, everybody is participating in the year-over-year EBITDA growth and Wireless is leading again heavily with ARPU improvement being a component of that. Anything else?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [22]

Yes, we can build on that a bit for sure, Q4 is a post-paid story and the vast majority of those adds were in post-paid with nice ARPU gains. If you look at the last 6 days, we've had a really exciting last 6 days in our business, not that volume has sky-rocketed, although volumes are healthy. Since we launched our new pricing, we've had thousands of our customers migrate upward, coming in at the $6 to $7 a month range. And of course, our adds are now coming in above $50 a month in terms of pricing, which is a major step forward for us. So we're really excited about life as a Big Gig and what it means for our revenue mix

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Gregory William MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Head of Equity Research of Canada   [23]

Great, that's helpful. Then a quick follow-on, if I could. The addition of Mike Sievert on the board is obviously good news. Wonder what this might mean for strategic opportunities for the company. And I'm thinking, specifically, on roaming agreements. Shaw -- T-Mobile has a very high -- well, unlimited. So a very high data cap strategy and it's pretty similar to Shaw, and Shaw has got lots of spectrum and, therefore, the ability to maybe a beneficial roamer for a company like that. Should -- are we getting -- am I getting too fast forward on something like that? Or is that something that you see as an opportunity vis-a-vis the addition to the board?

Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Non Independent Director   [24]

Yes, I think we'll always look at opportunities of relationship and when I think -- with T-Mobile, if it works for both companies, that makes good sense. I can't say that there is anything -- a big, long list here of anything that would be significant or things we need to do. But it's early stages and we will see how the opportunities arise as we go forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Gregory William MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Head of Equity Research of Canada   [25]

Are there roaming announcements to be made in 2018?

Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Non Independent Director   [26]

I don't think so

Operator   [27]

Our next question comes from Aravinda Galappatthige of Canaccord Genuity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Suranimala Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD   [28]

Just a couple from me. First of all, X1, early days, I know, but I was wondering if you share a bit more of your early learnings there. I know that initially you've talked about that as kind of a very good retention rule -- retention kind of a tool. But I also wanted to see what your thoughts are in terms of actually winning subs from competitors with X1. What sort of the profile you see from the new X1 customers? And then secondly, on the wireless side, you laid out a lot of your priorities, very helpful. Just wondering what your thoughts are on the distribution aspect? Are you satisfied with the distribution that you have? Or is that something that you would look to ramp up in the near term as well?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [29]

Great. Thank you, very much. We're excited by what we have seen in terms of BlueSky and the rollout of the X1 platform. I mean, if you think about video subscribers kind of in 3 particular segments, the majority of the market, probably about 60%, is still TV lovers. These are folks that have a TV in a main room in the house, watch a couple of hours TV at night, and are consuming TV in kind of the traditional way you consume TV. TV lovers love BlueSky, and it's created tremendous value in terms of now the integration on Netflix and other services being aggregated. And it's a fantastic product for that customer base and it is driving usage and on-demand and ARPU as you can expect. The other 2 segments are -- increasingly there's much more of a value-conscious video space, that are interested in video at sort of a $20 price point and those kinds of things. And we play a little bit in that space, but that is not really where BlueSky is. And then, of course, there's a streaming space that's dealing with over-the-top services and other services. And there is probably an opportunity for us to move that technology into that space, but we really wanted to launch it, target it clearly at TV lovers and it's getting the -- all of the right metrics and similar experiences to what Comcast and Cox and others have [experienced]. So we are super excited to have it. On distribution, we need to amp up distribution in wireless. We clearly need national distribution with some of the big players and be able -- people have the choice of freedom if they're shopping at the household main retailers. If you think about -- which is certainly going to be a focus and we'll continue to -- in our budget and in our plans continue to ramp up on the distribution model. To be clear, there is also a pivot as we change our pricing and commission, and all of things that happened with the retail model when you do a major shift like the Big Gig. So we're working hard on the implementation of that downstream into our distribution channel. I'm excited about what that makes possible

Our next question comes from Tim Casey of BMO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Equity Research Analyst   [31]

Just a question on X1. Can you talk a little bit about your transition from the current deployment to an all IP environment? Is that -- I'm assuming that's in your comments with respect to guidance and whatnot, but just wondering if you could talk -- flesh that out a little bit more, (inaudible) the actual platforms you will be deploying

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [32]

Great. Thanks, Tim. We're super excited about our X1 road map and very happy with where we are in the road map where we're in full deployment, hundreds of thousands of TVs enjoying X1 today. We also have a step-by-step approach here. So you've seen the integration of Netflix, which is happening with fantastic results in terms of the way customers are using Netflix. You'll see other aggregation launches on that stream. Today, we're doing a hybrid QAM/IP with basically all of your on-demand services being done on an IP and all of your livestreams -- I mean, yes, all of your on-demand services on IP and all your livestreams on QAM -- will launch before the end of this calendar year, likely or beginning of next calendar year. A series of new channels on a linear basis on IP, which will be our first step into IP linear. And then as you walk through calendar 2018, we will be able to move to the full IP architecture. For us, that won't necessarily change the customer experience initially, all that dramatically. The huge advantage, of course, is in success-based capital and self-install, and all of things that, that makes possible in terms of transforming our business. So I think we're on a similar time line to others for [IP] in terms of mass deployment, and that's likely in the second half of next calendar year

The next question comes from Maher Yaghi of Desjardins

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [34]

Jay, thanks for telling us about your wireless plans a bit more and the steps that you mentioned, the 1 to 6, but in those steps, I didn't hear about the timing or the plans about becoming more in line with what's driving consumer behavior in terms of choosing the partner or the supplier of services with a subsidy model? I mean, you guys have -- you can call it a subsidy model, but you have to spend $90 to start getting real savings on handsets with your plans. Can you talk about what you're thinking about implementing, a real subsidy model? And if you do, in which of those steps that you mentioned it would be introduced?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [35]

Yes. Certainly, part of the customer value equation, I hear are comments that we're coming at the market slightly different than others have come on the market. There's -- I didn't call that out as a major shift, because I see that as degrees that we're adjusting as we move into the marketplace. I don't know that you'll see us vary all that materially from what you describe, although it's clearly part of customers making choices. We're clearly super excited about enabling the Bring Your Own Device market, which is getting more and more significant and the opportunity to just move over to our network, enjoy tremendous buckets of data with phones that you already have. So I don't think you'll see us double down on the subsidy model, although you'll probably see greater investments than what you have seen so far

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [36]

So maybe bring down the level of ARPU that a customer needs to pay to get more savings, is that what you're referring to?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP   [37]

Well, Yaghi, I'll kick in here. Obviously, there is a connection between the subsidy and the overall ARPU profile and overall economics, right. So as I think we move through the next 24 months, you will see us continue to tweak and evolve as Jay has described

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [38]

Do you accept the hypothesis or the theory that the ARPU that you have, which is low compared to other companies out there is due to this specific issue that you're not subsidizing customers in order to get them to spend more with you?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [39]

Yes. Your questions seem to be related. Look, our overall customer ARPU is low today, because we're primarily on a 3G network, competing on the spectrum that was available to us. And there is no question, if we -- to our previous comments, if you look at our business through the lens of the big 3 with all of their free spectrum and their 25 years of sensational operation -- operating margins that they have invested back into their network, there is no question that we have to play the game differently. And you're going to see us play the game differently than the big 3 are playing the game. And I would make the argument that Canadians don't need to me-too. I would make the argument that Canadians need a differentiated wireless service. So I mean, the moves that we're making on our LTE ARPU are very encouraging, and I'm not totally fussed about the 3G base and where that ARPU moves. Those are customers that have made a good choice in terms of where they want to be and the price value relationship they want to play. We're really about building ARPUs for the future

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [40]

Okay. And just my last question on the video side. You are looking for TV subs to, you said, decline in the next quarter? Did I hear you correctly?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [41]

Yes. No, what I was refreshing for people that we believe maintaining and growing the video base is what winning looks like, and that's what we said a number of quarters ago and we are not changing that position. I also was saying that we're not going to drive video subs at the expense of profitability, now that we've shifted the market. And I was signaling that as you make pivots in the marketplace, that it takes a period of time for those pivots to flow through to numbers. So we're certainly signaling that we weren't necessarily be up every quarter in video in this fiscal year. And our comments on Q1 -- I mean, we're only halfway through Q1, and we will see where we land. But I don't want people to think that we are driving hundreds of thousands of video subs through this model. This was about creating a fantastic video experience for Canadians and increasing our video subs in a profitable way

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [42]

So in order to drive growth in your subscriber base on TV, are you looking forward into the IP platform to drive that growth versus just going up and down every quarter, is the IP version, the one that you think will get you to grow that business, the subsidies -- the subscriber base on a sustainable basis?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [43]

Yes. I mean, I certainly understand the question, I would like to reset it with -- to be clear, Shaw is an EBITDA growth story and we're starting this year with EBITDA growth of 5%, which is probably a good start and we're going to get moving. The 3 biggest opportunities are wireless first, absolutely, and then 2 and 3 are probably a tie, small and medium business and the opportunity to grow broadband revenue. We're excited about video because it's a super important part of our business. Do we see dramatic increases in video revenue and video profitability over the next couple of years? I'm not sure that we do. I think that we see some challenges in the economics of video going forward. And it's a part of the story. We're going to look to maintain and, perhaps, slightly grow our video market share. And what happens on ARPU in video is really consumers being in control. And consumers will make the choices they make, and we are in a great position to offer them whatever they want to aggregate with us. So, we're excited about where we are. I think the IP store will not only deliver new experiences to Canadians, including cloud DVR, which is significant breakthrough from any ability to take your content with you, some integration on the wireless side. So there's certainly some upside in that space, but I don't think video makes the big 3 growth opportunities

Our next question comes from Rob Goff of Echelon

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Robert Goff,  Echelon Wealth Partners Inc., Research Division - MD, Head of Research, and Telecom Services &amp; New Media Analyst   [45]

My question would be related to the disciplined growth on the cable side. Could you talk to the impacts you've seen from rate increases that were implemented this summer on existing contracts?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [46]

Yes. So Rob, the pricing that we do on existing service agreements is fixed within the service agreement. So to the extent that we make changes on month-to-month pricing, it doesn't apply to customers who are in a service agreement. So, as you can well appreciate, the changes in annual pricing probably has much less of an impact than you would have traditionally seen in the cable business some time ago

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP   [47]

Rob, I can add. When you think about the 2-year plans and the flip from year 1 to year 2, we have actually been pleased with the transition and customer behavior as they move from that year 1 price to year 2 price

Operator   [48]

Our next question comes from David McFadgen of Cormark Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David John McFadgen,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Director of Institutional Equity Research   [49]

I just have a question following up on a comment Vito made about CapEx in 2019 versus 2018. So given the cost to deploy that Quebecor spectrum is onetime in nature, I would have thought that the CapEx profile would go down in 2019 versus 2018. So given you've signaled that it's probably going to be somewhat similar, does that entail some geographical expansion of your wireless network in 2019 to rely less and less on others for roaming or [if] you just provide context as to why they wouldn't be going down a fair bit

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP   [50]

Yes, (inaudible), just to repeat -- is that $350 million number that we quoted, we still feel decent about that, obviously, and probably should at some point not get too specific about certain components and stay at a bit of a macro level. But they're going to -- that spectrum cost and that activation cost, as Jay alluded to, is really over a 2-year period. So F '19 will also reflect a significant amount of spend related to spectrum light-up of that $350 million original estimate

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David John McFadgen,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Director of Institutional Equity Research   [51]

Will there be some geographic expansion in wireless network? Or you don't really envision that?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [52]

I would -- I mean, as you talk about our multi-year horizon, I think it's premature to announce (inaudible) various markets. I think you'll see our wireless growth strategy and our EBITDA growth focus on existing markets in F '18

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Vince Valentini of TD Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [2]

Let me start by just saying Jim will be dearly missed and pass on my condolences to everybody at the company and the family. I know it's a tough time. My question, to start with, maybe for Vito, the -- can we just level set expectations on the Wireline side? So you went back to 3- and 6-month promotions versus the 12-month promotions in November. Does that mean we should see ARPU and, therefore, margins immediately snap back in Q2? Or does it take a little while for that to filter through your billing cycles?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [3]

Yes. Vince, it's Jay. I'll start and let Vito add some details to it. Yes, so we're doing what we said we were going to do, and we got the results that we expected to get. In fact, our Q1 results were a little bit ahead of budget and plan on EBITDA, although not really notably ahead basically, right on top of the results. There's no question, the way the change of promotional packages and prices work is you get RGU payment in the front end and you get financial gain at the back end, and that 6-month time lag is about right. If you think about the timing of all this, Q1 looks a lot like Q4 did. And on the Wireline side of the business, Q2 is going to continue to look a lot more like Q1 than the second half of the year. I mean, you won't recognize the Wireless side of the business in Q2 because it's different than anything you've seen before. So that part of Q2 will be different. And then the -- primarily revenue growth that comes from all of the pricing and promotional changes are material starting in Q3, and then you get the full value of it in Q4. So it's a time lag, but we believe on the -- we believe we've got the right approach here

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO   [4]

Yes. Thank you, Jay. I mean, I think you nailed it there. Vince, when you look at the EBITDA for the Wireline versus prior quarter, we were actually flat prior quarter, obviously down versus prior year. And I think you can see that that's a start -- as the pricing is starting to take effect and the migration -- continued migration in packaging. And we'll see that continue and improve as we move forward. So definitely, back-half loaded as the base shifts into the higher pricing and the promos fall off a bit

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [5]

Okay, great. And if I can shift for a question on Wireless. So to pick up on what you're saying there, Jay, that we won't recognize things in Q2. Are you willing to be any more definitive at this time as to what your sub adds and ARPU have looked like in the 6 weeks or so since Q1 ended?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [6]

Yes, sure. Well, I would tell you that I'm going to share a bunch of stuff and you'll probably come away thinking I haven't shared that much because that's what you usually say, Vince. The -- I think if you look at our transition into Big Gig, the launch of Big Gig was certainly successful for us, and we saw some nice but small migration in the base in the months of October and November, end of October, beginning of November. We didn't really see -- in fact, we didn't see an increase in gross sales volume. We saw the adds coming in at a higher price point, in and around -- starting to approach the $50 level at that point. And so we are seeing a healthier base, and we were seeing about 1% of the base a month moving up in terms of $6 or $7 a month in ARPU. So that's what you've seen in November. We might have frozen the market a bit both with our iPhone announcement and then also with our iPhone presales. So starting Black Friday, we did iPhones on presale, but all of those iPhones we sold, you'll see in the December numbers because they were all filled, most of them, in that December, 8, 9, 10 weekend kind of activity. I would say a couple of things about our new business because it does sound -- feel like a new business starting in December. And it was -- on the last call, we said to you that nobody ever underestimated the importance of Apple to our business, which meant to say that we were in active negotiations and we were -- we knew how important it was. To be clear, I underestimated the importance of the iPhone to our business. It has changed all aspects of our Wireless business. We're adding customers, all of them north of $50 monthly recurring revenue. We're selling a lot of phones. And you can see this in our numbers. We haven't historically been a place that sells phones as a high percentage of our net adds, and that has changed. So I think you're going to see a net gain in Q2 that's meaningfully stronger than what you've seen from us at any time and, as important, a really, really healthy revenue component to those net adds. Obviously, we had 4 or 5 days of record disconnects when we had our competitors jump into the space right before Christmas on greater distribution, and to be clear, our 3G base is exposed to those kinds of things. We've been exposed to Public Mobile in the past, and we were certainly exposed over those 4, 5 days. So it's maybe not quite the net quarter that we might have thought at one point it was going to be, but it's going to be very different than what we've seen in the past

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO   [7]

Jay, I'll just add. The ARPU commentary there, Vince, very similar to the Wireline side. I think it's going to obviously take some time for these customers who are coming in at a rate plan greater than $50 to have a more meaningful impact on our overall weighting. And you'll see that more back-half end loaded as -- and into F '19, obviously, as we move forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [8]

Okay. And if I can add one last clarification there. So you obviously had this huge surge of iPhone sales, given the promotions you had at sort of Black Friday and beginning of December. From your learnings from that experience, do you think you need to be that aggressive in the future, offering sort of $0, 8s and 10s? Or is that viewed as sort of temporary versus your more consistent promotional behavior? How should we think about that?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [9]

Yes. I would say this -- I would say to you the thinking this way. The Big Gig pricing is our pricing. And Paul will tell you he doesn't like to change rate plans, pricing. There's lots of complexity in distribution. It takes people a period of time to get in the cycle. It takes customers a period of time to get into the cycle. Our Big Gig pricing is our pricing, and don't expect to see us move from that on a weekly or monthly basis. We're going to have a pricing umbrella. So if we have some things that happen on pricing like happened before December, I think we came down $10, which I think was a measured approach, given the marketplace. We need a pricing umbrella just for where we are in the segment, I think. I think everyone understands that. So Big Gig pricing is our pricing. Device pricing and financing is a lever that we will use as we come in and out of the market. You only get to launch the i Phone once. We've waited -- this business has waited for an i Phone for a long time. We chose to launch it with impact, and we think that was a great call. What we do with device pricing, that's much more in response to the competitive environment and what happens on a go-forward basis. And part of it is the 0 down component, part of it's the amount of subsidy. All of that is being worked into our analysis. That having been said, we like the results that we're getting on the current pricing and we think it's sustainable, but you might see us make some adjustments on hardware pricing

Our next question comes from Jeff Fan of Scotiabank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director, Telecommunication Services and Canadian and U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [11]

And I just want to express my condolences to the Shaw family as well. Just a few follow-ups from the questions before and the answers before. Jay, I think you mentioned that -- around the Wireless competition in those 3 or 4 days, you mentioned that you saw a bit of a record disconnect. Is that what you pointed to? And I guess you mentioned the 3G base. So I guess the next question would be, how big is your 3G base? And how quickly are you whittling that down? And then just along the lines of competition in Wireless, I think you've made the point that you only launch an iPhone once and it's your coming out party. Did what the big 3 do in the market kind of dull some of the -- I guess, the upside that you would have expected to see from the i Phone, given how active they were in responding in that -- those 3 or 4 days' period?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [12]

Yes, great. Thanks, Jeff. The -- I did -- I don't know that I intended to use those exact words, but I did use the words record disconnects and they were correct. Look, the market got activated. And if you were in a [MO] over those 4, 5 days or talking to people, the Wireless market got active, and I guess you could argue we were a source of that activation. And I would make the argument that if the big 3 won't activate the market, in the long run, we'll win because we'll benefit from people shopping around and so forth. We took big disconnects over those 4 or 5 days, as you could imagine. We have a -- you've seen our historical base at $37 ARPU and they were exposed to those kinds of offers from other competitors. So we were going through strong daily net gains going into those days, and clearly, in that short period of time, there was -- our gross sales held up nicely. And we continued to get lots of movement from the big 3, but they got some movement from us over that period of time. That having been said, not to overstate that, you can't -- unfortunately, you can't replace the 5 key selling days before Christmas with 5 days in February, which was probably by design. But I think it was a healthy moment in time where the marketplace had a chance. And probably, in the medium term, if 10 for 60 -- 10 gigs for $60, including voice, has become a thing, we're the place you can get it in the marketplace. And so I think, in the medium term, that helps us. When I made my comments about the 3G base, we've correctly identified that, as we refarm and move into LTE, that large chunks of the 3G base will convert to LTE on a network basis. And we will get to the point where we'll have maybe 250,000 or 300,000 3G customers on the 3G network. I was mainly being a little lazy in my words. When you talk about the legacy base that's at the $37 ARPU, we're going to be able to move a portion of that base up into our plus $50 ARPU pricing. But remember, a bunch of that base is in a different space. It's in the space now occupied by Public Mobile, chatr and Lucky, and what we're occupying now is a more mid-market space that's almost above that. So we're not necessarily going to be able to wave a magic wand, convert that base to LTE and have that it all miraculously come to $50 ARPU. So I think we're going to continue to do our best in serving the segment that we have, where we're growing a very different-looking customer profile as we go forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director, Telecommunication Services and Canadian and U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [13]

Great. And maybe just a quick one on the core cable side. The video loss in the quarter, when you compare it to last year, you didn't have BlueSky in the market, but this quarter you had it. And the loss seems to be a little bit bigger. So I understand you've slowed down some of the promotional activities, which probably caused that. But I guess the question would be, like how should we think about, I guess, video adds or maybe cable RGUs overall for the remainder of the year of fiscal '18?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [14]

Yes. Thanks, Jeff. A couple of things to think about there. One is we certainly are in an adjustment quarter. And our plan is to also have a decrease in video subs in Q2, although a smaller decrease than we had in Q1. And then our plan suggests that we'll be able to move, as we move through that segment of customers, to neutral or slight positive starting in Q3 and continuing to Q4, is the way we look at the business today. If you think about the impact of BlueSky in the business, BlueSky is working. You've probably heard us talk before about the 3 video segments that are evolving in the marketplace. There're the TV lovers, that is a TV customer who watches TV on a television set, often in a shared family room or some kind of shared room, where more than one person in the household is watching the thing -- TV together a couple of times a week. Those are our classic BlueSky customers. We do very well in this segment. We did very well in this segment in Q1. We continue to do well. The other 2 segments are the price-sensitive and the streamer segments. The price-sensitive is that group that is prepared to pay $15 or $20 a month for video. We have played in that space promotionally but we never make any money there. And as far as -- because we're trying to -- we've been trying to market our legacy product to that group and you just -- you can't make money on a $20 video product with a legacy cost structure and a set-top box and a $100 truck roll and 3 calls into the call center, that space just doesn't make sense. So you've seen us pause on that group. And you've seen that in our Q1 video subs, and you'll see that a little bit in Q2. On the streamer segment, it's a little similar to the -- so that's the third segment. It's a little similar to the price-sensitive group, but it's really about consuming on devices. We don't have a pure-play product there. You can watch the Comcast roadmap and predict what we're going to do in those areas. So we think BlueSky is working. Our customers that have BlueSky love it, and they're our highest-value customers. And I think you'll just see us stabilize the base as we go through the rest of Q2 and then go to RGU [side] Going forward. In general terms, phone has been pretty sticky for us. Internet is doing well, and we're going to continue to see gains. Satellite was a hair softer in Q1 than expected. It -- there's the normal seasonal factor in Q1. I don't know that there's anything all that structural happening in Satellite, but we are a few thousand behind where we ideally would want to be. As you look forward, Satellite business is going to be tough. We're going to manage it for profitability. ARPU is holding up nicely on satellite video, and I don't think we're going to chase the RGU number to try and replace high-end value customers with really low-end, low customer lifetime value. I think we're really going to be focused on retention there

Our next question comes from Phillip Huang of Barclays Investment Bank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst   [16]

First, I also want to express my condolences on the passing of Jim. In terms of my question, I want to ask first on the BYOD ARPUs. I was wondering if you could give any color on the types of ARPUs that first, you're seeing or that you expect to get, just given the expanded adjustable market, yes, on the BYOD market from the refarming. I'd imagine that we will see a nice lift in the segment in addition to those customers buying a new i Phone from you. Just trying to assess the magnitude of the corresponding lift to ARPU from the BYOD segment that you expect

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [17]

Great. Thanks, Phillip. So to be clear, our whole business has been a BYOD business for a long time. We have sold a small percentage of phones on activations, well beneath the average. The challenge has been our BYOD business has put everybody onto a 3G network because the phones were not compatible with even our LTE spectrum. So we've always been in the BYOD business, and you see that in our $37 ARPU. Over the course of November, we did see a nice uptick in ARPUs and more than what we were seeing on the base of that $6 or $7 in the BYOD space. As we balance subsidy with monthly recurring revenue, we're working on is there a $10 break, which there often has been for BYD -- BYOD, and we'll work our way through that. To be clear, in Q2, we haven't put any energy into BYOD. We only have LTE activated in the Western markets. So I think you'll see us find our voice on that when we're ready to go everywhere. And then also it's hard to say 2 things at once, and we've been saying iPhone as loudly as anyone will listen. So our BYOD customers tend to come on about $10 less than our i Phone adds today in terms of their monthly, and it's a space we have not really leaned into LTE yet

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst   [18]

Right. Got it. No, that's very helpful. I was just wondering from the 3G. Say, if I'm an i Phone 7 user and now I can go onto your network, whereas that would have been 3G before the refarming, then how much more I would be willing to pay to go on your network. And the $10 remark is helpful. If I..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [19]

We've got big opportunities for the second half. We're not going to get bored with iPhone because we've been waiting a long time. We're going to drive that. In the second half of the year, the value proposition you just described is going to be right at the heart of our market

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst   [20]

Got it. No, that's very helpful. If I could squeeze in a second one. I mean, you've obviously talked a lot about the strong demand on the i Phone for you guys and having a much bigger lift for your business than you had expected. I'm just wondering, to the extent that it's also having -- requiring you to spend a little bit more to support that growth, is there any corresponding offset to potentially mitigate the impact to the full year free cash flow?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO   [21]

Well, we -- Phillip, it's Vito here. I mean, clearly, the subscribers that are coming in, there's a reinvestment there, without the lift in ARPU, into subsidy and into cost of acquisition. All of that is embedded in our EBITDA guidance. In respect to, obviously, working capital requirements and whatnot, we guided last -- in October, around what we expected to see. To some degree, the effect that we're exceeding our own expectations, we'll have adjustments to that, but all very, very manageable, obviously, with our balance sheet liquidity and cash on hand. So nothing significant to report at this point

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [22]

Our next question comes from Greg MacDonald of Macquarie Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Gregory William MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Head of Equity Research of Canada   [23]

And like the rest, I'll express my condolences to the group. So a quick question I want to have is on the wireline, the basic subscribers in particular, and maybe just a little more color on the profile of the declines and potential impacts on ARPU or pricing power there. We do know that there was some competitive activity in the quarter, Telus pulled back its promotional activity, I think, it was in kind of early December. So there was an impact from a competitive standpoint there. But the press release also makes reference to a change in customer mix. I wonder, are you talking cord cutting or Jay, the reference to streamers that you're talking about? To what extent is cord cutting, which is having a bigger impact in the U.S., to what extent is that having an impact in Canada, either in basic customer declines or also in loss of pricing power?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [24]

Great. Thanks, Greg. It's not the perfect quarter for us to talk about the video landscape because we have the adjustment things around promotional customers that we don't make a lot of money on. And so I don't want you to look at our video RGU number and say, the world is changing for video. But that having been said, even after our video number stabilize again, the world is changing for video. The video landscape is changing for the entire industry. I don't necessarily accept that Canada's all that different than the U.S. I think, in North America, things are changing and things are changing with the amount of streaming content, things are changing quite frankly with just the amount of content that's available in the cloud or free through what people call piracy and whatever words they use to describe it, including on sports. The video world is changing and there's things happening on video. And people will try and lean in and adjust to make their own numbers look better and stuff like that. There is stuff going on here. To be clear, of all companies, I think our 2-year head start on BlueSky, combined with our Wireless assets put us on the sunny side of wherever those industry changes are. Now I don't think there's anything scary in for us. I think we had such video competition early that others haven't had, that our video ARPUs have already adjusted and our video market shares have already adjusted. So I think we're on the sunny side of the changes in the video market. But the world and consumers are changing, and we can't control that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Gregory William MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Head of Equity Research of Canada   [25]

So to be clear, Jay, when you're describing in the release on change in video customer mix, I thought that, that was more related to what's happening in your promotional activity as opposed to cord cutting. Am I correct in making that assumption?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [26]

You are correct on that statement. So to be clear, what that statement clearly refers to is we have a mix of TV lovers and price-sensitive customers that we're playing in. We basically removed all of the offers that made video available for $15 and $20 a month. And as such, we didn't add any price-sensitive customers. You can imagine that segment has a high degree of churn as it comes off promotional periods. Now what we saw, we had a good quarter in our traditional TV lover's space. So that comment on the press release was about the structural change in our promotions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Gregory William MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Head of Equity Research of Canada   [27]

Okay, great, that's helpful. And a quick follow-on, if I could, on Wireless. For the second half of the quarter, with Big Gig being in the market, could you talk even contextually about the profile of existing customers increasing their data plans going on to the Big Gig plan versus the impact of gross adds? That would be helpful. So existing versus new

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [28]

Thank you, Greg. If you look at migration within the base, there's always migration in the base and because so much of our base has been BYOD and so forth, there's lots of room for customers to move up and down. In the history of WIND and in our time owning the asset, all of that would net up over the course of a month to be about 1% of the base, maybe 2% in an active month. And historically, that would be quite neutral or may be down $0.50 in terms of monthly recurring. From October 22 to the end of November, that activity increased a bit in terms of overall migration. And when you net all the pluses and all the minuses, in terms of people adjusting their monthly billing, they came up about $7. And interesting enough as November unfolded, that moved a little bit even more forward, moved from high $5s into the low $7s in terms of the activity. So it's clear that we've hit the marketplace so that there's a portion of our base that really likes this Big Gig abundant data approach and is going to buy into it. To be clear, although if you're -- you need to be patient

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO   [29]

Yes, the 1%, right?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [30]

If you have 1% or 2% of your base adjusting on a monthly basis and all of our new adds coming in at over $50, I mean, we're going to have a lovely ARPU story in 1 year or 2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO   [31]

Running in the right direction, absolutely

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [32]

But it takes a period of time for that to flush into the base

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Gregory William MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Head of Equity Research of Canada   [33]

Yes, and I'm drawing the conclusion that clearly, the bigger impact is the i Phone and the ability to sell that type of product into Big Gig plan, right? But when you say increased a bit, am I to conclude 1% going to 2% or something like that?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [34]

Directionally, you are on the right track

Our next question comes from Aravinda Galappatthige of Canaccord Genuity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Suranimala Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD   [36]

Thanks for taking my questions, and I also want to pass on my condolences to the family. With respect to -- my first question is on Wireless. I know you can't get too detailed here, but I was wondering if you're willing to offer some kind of color on the -- for the mix of the net adds you're winning in Wireless these days, both regionally and in terms of, I mean -- my general understanding is obviously, that more of the wins are still in the city in Toronto. Has that mix sort of changed in recent times? Are you seeing more of a balance to the West as well? Or has it been sort of a maybe steady mix over the last several quarters?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [37]

We're -- you correctly identified that our Wireless business is a -- is quite heavily weighted to the GTA. Has been. We saw some pick up in Alberta, in BC for sure. And there were some really interesting movement in the Vancouver market. Vancouver is actually, I guess, not unlike Toronto, to a point; it's quite a price-sensitive market just because of the relationship of the cost to housing to people's income. And so we saw some nice movement in the Vancouver market. But to be clear, our December business continue to be incurred in Toronto, maybe slightly less so than in previous months. But the GTA matters to our Wireless business

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO   [38]

I'll just add on a net basis as well, predominantly postpaids, is where it all landed. I mean, healthy gross adds both on postpaids and prepaids but nice churn improvement on postpaid. So when you look at the net adds, significant majority of it is effectively postpaids, again, another strong ARPU feature indicator

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Suranimala Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD   [39]

Great, thanks for that. And just a quick follow-up on the Wireless side. You experienced as you kind of refarm the AWS-1, I know you completed that in the West. What's sort of been your experience in terms of sort of network performance and capacity there? And what are your expectations as you kind of move that process to Ontario, where there's probably going to be much greater need for capacity? Do you feel that, that refarm spectrum can kind of support what you would potentially get in terms of demand in Ontario?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [40]

Great. Yes. I mean, to be clear, the refarming exercise happened so quickly in the West and has also happened in most parts of Ontario with the exception of the GTA. It's kind of hard to sell other communities until you get the GTA up to speed, so it really hasn't been our focus. It happened so quickly because there wasn't congestion, right? And so you could simply -- we didn't have enough customers to cause congestion in the West. And so you could simply move the spectrum over into a smaller number of sites you had to fill in with 2,500 in order to take -- to relieve congestion. The fact that Toronto is taking longer is partially just because civil construction is harder in Toronto and it just takes longer, I mean, we're not as connected there. But it's more materially because we've got a lot of customers in Toronto and a lot of activity. And so we just can't pull back that 10 MHz of AWS-1 without replacing it with 2,500 MHz. The team has done a terrific job and a shout-out to our entire technology team, and particularly the team under Brian in Wireless. The planning process of -- of course, 2,500 MHz is extremely dense and allows us to manage tremendous amounts of capacity. The plan works, and we're able to actually improve the customer experience as we do the refarm. And then the LTE network continues to be wide open even in Toronto. So from a congestion point of view, it all works. It just takes us a little bit longer. The good news is we've had the i Phone to be our focus for this 4 or 5-month period. So we haven't lost anything, and we'll be able to come hard with VOD as we complete

Our next question comes from Tim Casey of BMO Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Equity Research Analyst   [42]

I just wanted to revisit a comment you made Jay, where you thought -- I think the expression you used you thought you were on the sunny side of the industry developments, yet you described your video business as really focused on TV lovers. You can't make money in the price-sensitive segment and you don't have a product yet for the streamers. Yet by your own admission, that legacy component or market is the one that is transitioning away. And it seems that whenever you stop the price lever, there's almost an immediate impact in subs. I'm just wondering if you could square those comments for us. And I guess, as a follow-on, you've indicated on the Wireless side, your pricing is your pricing. That doesn't seem to be the case on Wireline. It seems to be more dynamic. I'm just wondering if you can reconcile those thoughts

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [43]

Yes. Great. Tim. The -- if you think about our approach to video, we continue to do well in that TV lovers space, and we love this BlueSky product as does our customers because it integrates the Internet, digital experience and your TV experience, and it's the best-in-class experience. And the growth -- to be clear, even within our BlueSky base, maintaining ARPU is kind of the new op. We're not seeing big ARPU gains as we deploy BlueSky into that base, but we are seeing increased stickiness, reduction of churn, and the combination of BlueSky and Internet 150 is a terrific package, and when we ultimately add Wireless for that customer, that's a beautiful customer -- lifetime value customer. So that's a super important part of our business. When we said clearly that we couldn't compete in the price-sensitive or streamers space on our legacy cost structure, that was about us being very clear that the old cable company is not going to be able to compete with Netflix and Google and Amazon in the video space. To be clear, Shaw is going to compete in that space but we're not going to compete in that space as a traditional cable company. We've got a tremendous roadmap in the home from Comcast, so BlueSky is our first deliverable, but the whole Comcast roadmap is what we've signed on for. And we are totally committed. And this will be a bigger thing on the Wireline side of the business just because of scale. We are totally committed to creating a modern digital experience, which can both drive customer satisfaction and material bottom line savings. And as we deliver that modern service delivery model, with the modern product, there's money to be made in that space. And I think to be fair, it's probably less money than in the legacy space

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO   [44]

And that's flowing through our results

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [45]

Yes, that's flowing through our results. But we're working hard on not just the next set of product offering, but probably more important, that digital self-serve, no set-top box cost structure that will be critical for us to be in that space. So today, see us focus on TV lovers because we've got the best products on the globe for that. And we're working hard not only to deliver the next set of products, but digital, low-cost, self-serve, data-driven business model that really becomes the new Shaw in that space

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Equity Research Analyst   [46]

When do you think we'll get there, Jay?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [47]

I think you get the customer-facing solutions, certainly -- in calendar 2018, certainly. And you get major inroads in terms of self-install in calendar 2018. If you start talking about the completely digital network phone, Shaw, I think really, you make progress in that area, but that's more of a 24- to 36-month to completion in the transformation. We're spending an awful lot of time up -- on the Wireline side of our business, multiyear transformation, new operating model. We'll have more to say in this in the Q2 call, and you may even see in the next coming weeks on the operating model side that we're starting to make some significant moves on that side

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO   [48]

And Tim, in the meantime, you've got Internet really strong, you've got our B2B really strong, you've got obviously, Wireless and everything we've talked about. So we feel pretty good about those 4 components and how they're working through

Our next question comes from Drew McReynolds of RBC Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst   [50]

Condolences to everyone as well. Two questions. First, Vito, maybe just provide us an update on your thinking with respect to the Corus stake, if anything's kind of changed there? And then secondly, on the Internet side, clearly, you guys are holding your ground and probably doing a little bit better. Can you just comment on the competitive dynamics within fiber-to-the-home footprints? Have they changed relative to perhaps some of your commentary over the last year or 2? Or is it just fairly status quo within those footprints from a competitive intensity standpoint?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO   [51]

Jay, why don't you take the Internet and then maybe sweep up the Corus one as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [52]

Sure. Okay. Well, let's start with the Internet one. With the strength of our Wireline network has us well positioned. We're making moves into DOCSIS 3.1, and we have built into the model another level of speed and service in the marketplace that would allow us to compete with fiber-to-the-home activity from our competitors. So we think we're in good shape there. We think there is significant customer value in our broadband product and quite frankly, in the broadband product that we offer by the fiber-to-the-home providers. And with that value comes pricing power, and so as we continue to deliver faster speeds and unlimited data, I think we think about it in that regard. I think it's fair to say through that fiber-to-the-home areas and our competitor compared to non-fiber-to-the-home, that in general terms, we are now indexing 3 or 4 points higher in the non-fiber-to-the-home competitive areas as opposed to 3 or 4 points lower in the fiber-to-the-home competitive areas. We have quite equal market share in most of the markets that we are in, very different than the U.S. and I think, even different than parts of Canada. So there's still upside for us in that space. We don't think we're missing anything, and we continue to make investments in our Wireline network and feel pretty good with where we are on there. And if I can comment briefly on Corus, I don't really have a lot to add to the public discussion around Corus. I think we'll leave that mostly to others. It was never our intention to hold this investment in perpetuity. And from our perspective or from my perspective, look, we have a terrific balance sheet. We've got a solid EBITDA growth story, and we have no urgent cash requirements, would be our comments on that

 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [55]

My condolences to the family as well. I wanted to ask you, Jay, about your comment on the promotional activity that happened in December. You discussed it to a good extent. But I wanted to understand, why do your customers who pay in the $35, $40 range, as you said, mostly are 3G customers, taking promotions at $60 for 10 gigs, while you had in the market a product for $50 and 10 gigs. Why -- what's -- what is driving -- or what drove these customers to go to the competitor for something that you already offered and could -- they could have taken advantage of already? So I'm trying to understand what you need to do to keep those customers happy more than what you're doing already?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [56]

Great. I would say 2 things on that. One is I know -- I understand the philosophy that the direction of the base of customers that we bought when we bought WIND is determinant of our success in the Wireless business. I would make the argument that when we bought WIND, it wasn't about the customer base, it was about the spectrum and the network and the opportunities and the chance to point the business in a direction that we're now pointing. And so I understand that people would like to see us aggressively monetize the historical base and bring them up the chain. We're going to do some of that. But clearly, when we talk about our aspirations in the Wireless business, it's to play in a different space. And today, we're in quite a different market position because that's what was available to us. The reason the victory or having such success with Lucky and chatr and perhaps Public Mobile is very difficult for us to compete with them in that space, when you look at their distribution, when you look at their network, when you look at their in and out of roaming areas, that's just a fight that we don't have many levers in. And the consumer who is angry at the big 3 for their data overage charges, there's lots of room for us there. And it's harder for them to respond in that space than it is for them to come up with something achieved on Public Mobile or chatr. So I think that's how we're thinking about the business. If you're asking us about why we have higher churn than the other carriers, and why we're exposed to that side of the base, I think that's quite frankly where our business was and is. We do have higher churn. We have a prepaid base that's available for customers to -- for our competitors to reach into. We don't have our base secured in the same way as others have their base secured. There is no question in the voice world, there's still in and out of service area with included roaming and other things. That is a complexity in our value equation that isn't a complexity with the big 3. And so when I talk about a pricing umbrella, the reason we're not going to be a member of -- a junior member of the big 4 is if we offer exactly the same prices like the other 3 guys do with exactly the same offers, we won't win. There is in and out of market roaming and there are some things on the network, and there's a -- we've got a less secure base and higher churn than they have. We are playing a different game, which is what we're up to

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [57]

And just a follow-up. I always thought it's cheaper to, let's say, upgrade a customer that you already have than going out and grabbing a customer from the competition and having to subsidize or do any -- I mean, is there an opportunity to -- now that you saw that there is a good amount of customers on -- your own customers on 3G that are readily willing to pay $60 for 10 gigs, why -- I mean, is there an opportunity here to upgrade them before they go somewhere else? And what do you need to do to do that?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [58]

Yes. For sure there's an opportunity. For sure there's an opportunity and I think we have the opportunity to focus as we go forward. And we are a relatively simple wireless operation and we're doing one thing at the time and we had the opportunity to expand our addressable market with iPhone, and we chose to do that. And we've got no regrets on that level of focus. I understand we could have focused on other things in December but I think we focused -- I think we focused on the right thing. To be clear, we saw disconnects for 4 or 5 days. I really don't have that much to say. I guess we're on the phone first. I don't have much to say about the wireless desktop that we are primarily a spectator in. The big 3 were the primary participants in this. Our disconnects over those 4 or 5 days must have been a small, small, small fraction of the swap that those 3 guys did to each other and we were kind of a spectator in the shopping malls over those 4 or 5 days. So while we indicated that we went from net gains on those days -- on the previous days to kind of flat days for a few days, which was a tremendous amount of activity for us. I mean, that 4- or 5-day story isn't really for us to tell, and the big 3 will have a lot more to say about that than we will

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO   [59]

And Maher, I'll just add to Jay's comment that in fact, although not the focus in December clearly with the iPhone launch, upgrades were significantly higher than they have traditionally been in the month and we recognize the cost of acquisition deferential there, for sure

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [60]

Our next question comes from David McFadgen of Cormark Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David John McFadgen,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Director of Institutional Equity Research   [61]

Please also convey my condolences to the Shaw family. Just a couple of questions. So on the video subscribers, you talked earlier about Q2 is probably going to be negative as well and Q3 neutral to positive, Q4 positive, do you think that you could actually finish up fiscal 2018 on a neutral basis? Or is the result in Q1 just too much of a negative? And then secondly on the Wireless ARPU. If you look at Quebecor's experience, within 2 quarters of them offering iPhone, their ARPU was growing at a double-digit rate. Do you think we could start to see some meaningful uplift on your Wireless ARPU within 2 quarters? Or is it just too early to say?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [62]

Yes. Great. I'll take the first one, David, and I'll let Vito take the second. Look, we don't guide on RGUs, particularly, because it's such a competitive environment and things move up and down. I don't want you to think we're sitting with a control panel and we're adjusting the various levers and we know exactly to the single unit where we're going to land. We are being very purposeful in our step-by-step approaches on both Wireless and Wireline. And to be clear, our Wireline plan that we're offering the business to today does not get us back to neutral in video but does get us back to potentially growing and being more neutral on a quarterly basis in Q3 and Q4. And there's a good news story as you do the math back from guidance, you can see the benefit of what we're doing here and what it means for the EBITDA story in the back half and you can -- I'm sure, you can do the math yourself on that. We're not prepared to give up that financial benefit that we're getting in the second half of the year that add another 5,000 video subs or something like that. But we are excited about getting through this part of the business so that we can get back to some stability. And in terms of Wireless..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO   [63]

David, your comment about Quebecor is interesting. I mean, you've got some network perhaps differentials there between us and them on that side of things. But I'd circle Q4 of this coming -- of fiscal '18 as one to watch. Definitely, as we've talked about through the course of the call, the weighting of the incoming valued customers should start to see some meaningful impact in our back half, particularly Q4, heading into F '19 as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David John McFadgen,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Director of Institutional Equity Research   [64]

And if I can just add one additional question on Wireless. Do you think within, say, the next 12 months, you would actually bundle the Wireless product with your existing telecom services out West?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [65]

Yes. I mean, clearly, as we work our step-by-step approach on both the Wireline and Wireless sides of our business, bundle is going to be a hugely important part of the modern digital Shaw experience. 12 months, it's possible you might be on the light end, but it's certainly possible

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David John McFadgen,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Director of Institutional Equity Research   [66]

Okay. And would that at all be contingent upon any, say, CRTC ruling on wireless roaming or something like that?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [67]

Yes. I mean, there are so many variables in our business. And we are in a disruption-heavy competitive environment. So yes, there's a level of agility that is required. And I think that's actually a competitive advantage of ours not only as consumers and behaviors and needs change but also as regulations change. I think, we -- there's a decent line if sight with the costing model on roaming is a model in the calculation and there's a decent line of sight of where we'll probably land there, which is probably good on voice, not great on data. We'll see where it lands. I don't think that will be instructive. 600 is super important for us. We're building a business around kind of that stuff, landing where we're thinking it's going to land. I don't think that will be determinative. I think the bigger part of this is really -- we're taking a step-by-step approach to Wireline and a step-by-step approach to Wireless. And then over time, those steps bring those things closer together in support of a more modern service delivery model and a model -- a new Shaw really in terms of how we're approaching things. And I think if you look at the last 18 months closely, you can see in terms of our go-to-markets, we've already started that with BlueSky and WideOpen Internet 150 and the Smart suite of services and Big Gig and the hero devices with iPhone and have seen lots of those go-to-markets together. In many ways, it's the operating model, but digital, the self-serve, the data segmentation that will come in behind that and enable the coming together of the 2 sides. So I think we're in control of our destiny and not necessarily waiting for external things to happen

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [68]

This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Mehr for any closing remarks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [69]

Thank you, again, for the call. It's a -- it's going to be a difficult day here today with the AGM and the services for Jim, tomorrow. Again, on behalf of Brad, I want to thank you for all of your kind thoughts. And we know that Jim would want us to be completely focused on the business. We're going to take 1 minute or 2 and not be totally focused over the next day or 2, but we are going to continue to build this business as we go through these difficult times. We have a plan. We're being purposeful but what we're doing on both the Wireless and Wireline side, meaningful moves on operating model coming forward in the next couple of weeks, more info in Q2, and we couldn't be more excited about the opportunity for our business both in terms of market share gains on the Wireless side, Internet, revenue opportunities, opportunities in Business and our long-term EBITDA story. Thank you very much for your time today

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Tim Casey from BMO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Equity Research Analyst   [2]

(technical difficulty) occurred through the quarter. That's a pretty impressive number you put up with 90,000 adds

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Strategy &amp; Business Development Officer   [3]

Sorry, Tim, it's Trevor. We missed the front of your question. Can you repeat?

Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Equity Research Analyst   [4]

Just wondering if you could provide a little more detail on the Wireless metrics in the quarter, specifically how the timing went on the -- because that 90,000 adds you put up is a pretty impressive number. Just wondering, you cited that it was a pretty busy holiday season. Could you give us some color on how much occurred through the quarter in terms of the holiday season versus January and February? And then maybe some outlook on trends post quarter? And as well, could you talk a little bit about the ARPU of the new subscribes you're loading? And how we should think about how ARPU will trend going forward?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO of Freedom Mobile   [5]

Tim, it's Paul McAleese. Thank you for the question. We saw positive momentum right through the quarter, and that's continued into the third quarter. Within the quarter itself, the second quarter, December was very, very strong, of course, helped by the December 8 launch of the iPhone. But as you know, on net, we also had a number of bad days that contributed to the December results. So overall December was strong. That momentum continued nicely into the post-Christmas period in January and February. And, as I say, we're continuing to be very pleased with what we're seeing from consumers heading into this quarter. On ARPU of new subscribers, we focused our investments, Tim, and I kind of classify those as subsidy and distribution commission as well as financing on plans above $50. So we are continuing to see the average new cohort of subscribers come in above the $50 level, which of course is helping pull through the denominator of our historical ARPU. So this is not a $37 ARPU class that we're seeing any longer like we used to

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Equity Research Analyst   [6]

Is it fair -- with the 90,000, would that be fair to say it's spread evenly over the 3 months? Or would be more of the loads have occurred in December?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO of Freedom Mobile   [7]

Yes. The -- a good percentage of the loads, as you would expect due to the seasonality of Christmas, happened in December, but we saw strong growth both in January and February as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [8]

Our next question comes from Vince Valentini of TD Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [9]

Let's stay with Wireless first for a second. Paul, are you worried that these numbers are almost too good in terms of shocking the incumbents? We saw them retaliate for 4 or 5 days in December, and as you've admitted, you lost subs during that period of time. Are you worried that if you keep adding at this pace, I mean 360,000 on an annualized basis is pretty dramatic. Do you want to maintain this type of pace? And if so, are you prepared for retaliation from the incumbents?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO of Freedom Mobile   [10]

Thanks, Vince. A few points on that. I think first off, we believe we're on a new and sustainable trajectory. So we're confident in our growth potential. And we'd also agree with many of the analysts on this call that there is ample category growth for the industry to maintain good price rationality. So if you look at what happened over the last quarter, the industry reported strong growth. We're pleased to join those numbers and that group. But a couple of points on the key drivers for Q2. Clearly, there is some positive effect related to both seasonality and the iPhone launch effect. So I would be cautious in multiplying 93,000 times 4, although I'm grateful for the confidence. We saw some moderate gains in gross market share. And that's, I think, a fair expectation going forward, that we'll continue to take some there. We are now selling a device that -- or a series of devices that constitute about 40% of gross adds in the Canadian market. We weren't previously offering that. So we'd expect to see some pickup on that. And then finally, and this is really important as we kind of narrate the story, we've seen significant improvements in our customer experience related to the great work that our network team has done on our overall product quality. So it wasn't simply about going out and getting a bunch of more gross adds. We had record levels of customer retention during the quarter, and that really helped contribute to the 90,000 as well. So it's not just a go-out-and-get-them story. I think we have done a great job of maintaining existing customer relationships and the great work that the team has done in advancing the refarming and allowing what had previously been hundreds of thousands of customers that were on a 3G experience with us to experience our LTE network and get large buckets of data on the new rate plans really contributed overall. So I would be cautious going forward other than to say that we like the trajectory we're on. We think there's room for everybody to grow here, and we are satisfied with the quarter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [11]

Okay. And you mentioned the churn. Do you happen to want to give us what your churn number is yet? Or are you guys still keeping that under wraps?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO of Freedom Mobile   [12]

I think we're going to start bringing those metrics to the market perhaps early in the next fiscal

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Strategy &amp; Business Development Officer   [13]

Yes. I think we've been -- as we get a bit more maturity and normalization in the business, we'll start to disclose some of the churn metrics, probably in fiscal 2019

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [14]

Okay. And one more Wireless question and then a cable or bigger-picture question. So given that you're seeing these gross adds now, given that your churn is at record levels, as you said, does that give you confidence that the initial wave of network investment is succeeding and is largely done? I mean, you guys have owned WIND for just about 2 years, and this is the first quarter you've finally seen a breakout in your subs. So it was 2 years of network construction and now starting to reap the benefits of that. Do you still think you're years away and potentially billions of dollars away in terms of CapEx to get your network to a credible point? Or do you feel this is an endorsement that you're already there?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [15]

Vince, it's Jay. This is not a single quarter result. It's obviously helped by the holiday season and a very strong seasonal period in January. This is a new Wireless business that we're building at Shaw, and it's exactly the business that we told you we'll be building on a step-by-step plan and the results are proceeding exactly as we wanted them to proceed. The LTE network is performing well. I know a number of people were surprised with the smaller number in terms of the roaming rebate that we got. It is simply because our network is better than people think it is. We're not relying on roaming as much as people think we are. By the same token, we love the roaming decision, the opportunities on the MVNO, the opportunities that we have with the 600 option. Everything is proceeding beautifully. Just to be clear, there is no forklift capital in our Wireless plan. This is step by step. We're continuing to roll out the 700. We're -- we have great momentum, and we're just going to stick to the plan on Wireless and keep doing what we've been doing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [16]

And last question was just on the Total Business Transformation. Maybe clarifications in some ways but also a question. The $48 million that you -- in 2018, that must be a run rate as of exiting the year? Or do you actually think you'll get $48 million of in-period savings in Q3 and Q4?

Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [17]

Vince, thanks for that. I'm going to jump in here a little bit to talk about TBT a bit, and then I'll let Trevor or one of the guys answer that. Total Business Transformation is absolutely necessary for Shaw to meet customer expectations, to compete more effectively, ensure that we capitalize on opportunities to deliver long-term growth. We're approaching TBT from a position of strength, strong wireline network, where we made significant investments to be ready to capitalize on emerging technology, gigabyte speeds, IPTV, home gateways, 5G. Thriving Wireless business with strategic step-by-step plans grow in a profitable manner. We have a detailed plan to ensure minimal disruptions to our business and a vast majority of the roles, which we talked about, can be addressed through modern digital service and automation. I have extremely high confidence in the ability of our leadership team to successfully execute on the plan. And I can tell you that employee morale remains high as change creates opportunities. First of all, fair treatment of employees fosters loyalty among both those who are leaving and those who are staying. Employees that choose to stay are totally excited about the contribution and -- contribution they're going to make to change and want to be a part of this great story we have. Ultimately, I think when we look at the business and how we've run it for so many years and corporate leading, I really think the opportunity for us to make decisions closer to the customer works and is absolutely needed as we go forward. And I love the idea of full accountability in each business unit, is I think is absolutely fundamental. So I know there's been a lot of concern about TBT and the voluntary program, but I -- we take things, we plan for this. We -- this is what we do as leaders. And you adjust these plans as things happen. And very confident that we have all the pieces in place to make this very successful for all our shareholders. So in F '20 and beyond, the increase of free cash flow to shareholders, I think, is going to be significant, and we really want to make sure, as we go forward, we're supporting our long-term initiatives and plan to deliver free cash flow and dividend growth. So sorry for taking your question away. But I thought it was very important to address some of the things here. And we take things very seriously. And I think with us we have -- we may be a little ahead of the curve, I'm not sure. When you look at traditional businesses and disruption and what people and companies are going through, I think we certainly see the opportunity to be a more lean and streamlined company and are taking the steps and are absolutely focused on the growth businesses, absolutely making sure we make the proper investments as we go forward for the long-term profitability of this company. So thank you for that, Vince, and I'll throw it over to you, Trevor

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Strategy &amp; Business Development Officer   [18]

Yes, Vince, it's Trevor. Maybe I'll try helping you with the modeling and the financials aspect of it. So in F '18, there is about $48 million of savings as we quoted in the press release. And that relates to the exit of about 1,200 people between now and the end of August. And I can tell you as of March 26 -- or 29 when the exit started, it was about 400 on that day. So the $48 million -- and the early exits, I would say, are more leaders, management, corporate folks. As we roll out throughout the really 18 months, but in some unique circumstances, we pushed that out some of the exits, it's about 500 people now into the 24-month period. The savings sort of go from $48 million in F '18, the $215 million we quoted in 2020 in then to help bridge you. That's about $150 million in
 F '19 as well. And that's when you get into the 60% roughly OpEx, 40% CapEx. And just maybe a little bit of additional granularity to help you. VDP was really focused on areas within our Wireline business, and those savings are really more, it's above 90% within Wireline versus Wireless. And in fact in F '18, it's above 95% that's within Wireless versus -- pardon me, Wireline versus Wireless. So hopefully that helps you with the modeling. In terms of timing of exits and cash flow, we did book a provision this quarter in -- on the balance sheet. About $18 million have already been spent as of the end of Q2. We've got about $200 million going out the door related to the exits within the next 12 months and then another $200 million from months 12 to 24. And that's disclosed in the financials and the provision that we took today -- this morning

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [19]

Our next question comes from Drew McReynolds of RBC Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst   [20]

Just a couple of follow-ups on the Wireless side. Wondering, I guess, Paul, if you can just talk to -- I think you launched the online sales channel. But more broadly, just from a loading perspective and your distribution footprint, can you just provide a little bit more granularity where some of this is coming from? And I think in previous quarters, you've commented on the relative loading between the Ontario market and BC and Alberta. So just wondering if you could add some granularity there. And I'll have one follow-up, if that's okay

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO of Freedom Mobile   [21]

Thanks, Drew. We're very, very pleased with our performance of the distribution over the course of last quarter. As you know, we split broadly evenly between distributors and our corporate stores in terms of their gross activations over the course of a quarter. We continued to see that split through the second quarter. And we continued to see a consistent split between -- or historical split between the East and the West. The East is about 70% of our gross adds and the West is about 30%. And again, possibly some opportunity there in due course. So we're very pleased to have brought on our first national retailer in Loblaws, which will be starting to activate as early as this week in those stores. It's not going to be the first time, Drew, that we sit on the shelf with our competition. So we're eager to see how that plays out over the next sort of while, but very confident

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst   [22]

Okay. That's great. And Paul, just a follow-up. I think last quarter you were asked a question just on the Wireless, Wireline bundle potentially within 12 months and the Shaw-branded wireless service. Just -- is there any update there that you can provide us just given what's happened with your deployment roadmap across all the Wireless initiatives

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [23]

Yes, it's Jay. Maybe I'll take that, Drew. More to come on that file. I think we've been very clear that we have a crisp and clear plan on Wireless that we're executing on a step-by-step basis, and we are going to let Wireless run. As you can appreciate on the Wireline side of the business, we're going through some pretty major structural transformation. We've got lots of work to do on that side. So things will come in the future. But I don't have anything to add today expect that we're going to continue to lean into the Wireless momentum that we have today

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [24]

Our next question comes from Jeff Fan of Scotiabank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director, Telecommunication Services and Canadian and U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [25]

Just a couple of quick follow-ups on Wireless, if I can. And then a question on the cable business. With respect to the adds, Paul, is it fair to say the contribution to your improvement in net is pretty balanced between contribution from gross as well as lower churn? And then also, in terms of contribution to your gross, how would you describe where you're getting from BYOD versus the equipment, those subscribers that come with an equipment sale?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO of Freedom Mobile   [26]

Jeff, yes, thank you. Yes, the -- I'll work in kind of reverse order here. So BYOD continues to be an important part of our business. In the second quarter, we actually saw a historically low percentage of our gross adds coming from BYOD. So sub-50%. So again we are focusing on those longer-term relationships that we can acquire through putting higher value customers on better devices on Big Gig rate plans, many of them financing their device over a couple of years, a good solid anchor relationship that we can build on for years to come. We still love BYOD customers, and we love the value that we can bring them. But that has, in the second quarter, been a smaller part of the overall business. On gross adds -- sorry the first of the question if I could, if this was a split?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Strategy &amp; Business Development Officer   [27]

Gross adds versus churn

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO of Freedom Mobile   [28]

Yes, versus churn. I'd say that's an even split in terms of their relative weighting to the overall piece. We're really pleased with the retention story that we are building over the last couple of quarters. And I can't overstate the fact that when you take hundreds of thousands of customers from a 3G to an LTE experience, as we've been able to do, we're really starting to reap the dividend of that in terms of the customer experience. So yes, about an even split, I would say, between those 2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director, Telecommunication Services and Canadian and U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [29]

Okay. And then a question on cable, more specifically the consumer revenue as we look out to the second half of the year. There's a lot of moving parts. You put through some price increases. You've made some changes to your promos. Yet at the same time, you do have some subscribers who are coming off of promo plans. Can you help us kind of think through all those moving parts and how the second half consumer revenue will track? How is it going to look with all those moving parts? And then, I guess, a bigger question is, you've had some management changes recently. I guess, one of the things that, I guess, I want to get my head around is with respect to pricing and packaging decisions and how that has -- that responsibility may or may not have changed within the organization in terms of where that decision rests

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Strategy &amp; Business Development Officer   [30]

Jeff, it's Trevor. Maybe I'll help with the bridge on the second half in terms of the consumer revenue side. Clearly there's been lots of movement with reduction of promos, some rate adjustments in Q2 that have been made that will flow through into Q3 and Q4. We've also announced, and I think it's been talked about, there's some -- our annual rate adjustment comes in on Q4 -- June 1. And that is forecasted to contribute about $7 million on -- $7.5 million of revenue on Consumer as well. So clearly this is all of the moves we've made in Q2, Q3 -- pardon me, Q2, Q1 and even in the back half of '17 will flow through into Q4 Consumer revenue where there's a fairly significant ramp, which is what we're expecting. And that's all embedded in the guidance that we confirmed as well this morning

And building on that, Jeff, it's Jay. The $7.5 million on the rate adjustment is on a monthly

 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Strategy &amp; Business Development Officer   [32]

On a monthly basis, pardon me

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [33]

Just to be clear. And results on Wireline revenue we're seeing this -- start of this quarter, already are performing exactly like we thought they were performing. So we're seeing the nice steps back in terms of the ramp that goes through in Q4. Jeff, in terms of leadership changes, we've got a crisp organizational structure with a clear pricing and packaging and marketing is now within each of our 3 business units of Wireless, Consumer and Business. We have great confidence in the teams that are driving each of those business units. And we think we've got a great level of focus on what each of our jobs are ahead. There's opportunities in all 3 of those spaces. The opportunities are not the same and -- as each other. So I think the dedication and focus on those functions will be really important for us going forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director, Telecommunication Services and Canadian and U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [34]

And just one specification. Are -- is the cable or the Wireline segment, I guess, between Consumer and Business, how are those segments now or managers being evaluated? Are they all evaluated on a more P&amp;L basis now?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Strategy &amp; Business Development Officer   [35]

Yes. There's -- on all 3 of our segments where everyone is very crisply measured on metrics, and we've got a job to do. Clearly Consumers got a profitability plan that we're supportive of. And to be clear, where the Consumer business is on, it's EBITDA budget for 6 months of this year and will continue to be. We're focused on this and we always planned a strong second half. On Business, absolutely, there is a focus on P&amp;L. There's also a focus on growth. We saw a little bit of moderating in our growth curve and it may take us a quarter or 2 to get back north of that 7% instead of the 5.3% we're at, at this quarter. But to be clear, we're -- we continue to believe there's lots of growth in the Business side, and we're asking our leadership team to deliver that

Our next question comes from Phillip Huang of Barclays

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst   [37]

Want to go back to ARPU. Obviously, it's a bit of a leg in had you just given the big base that you have. So it's pretty impressive for us to see such a nice jump. Now that you mentioned the ARPU of these subs are all coming in sort of above $50 level, should we expect pretty strong acceleration in terms of growth here? Or are there any offsetting factors that we should also take into consideration as the year progresses? And then I also have a follow-up question on the wholesale roaming rate. Now that it's finalized, I see that you reversed expenses of $12 million in fiscal Q3. I'm assuming that's related to the retroactive application of that. Just wondering if you could comment on the savings going forward given that that's presumably through 2 years, should we assume that you're yet to get $6 million of benefit per year going forward? Or do you expect a bigger number because obviously you've got a bigger (inaudible) now?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO of Freedom Mobile   [38]

Phillip, it's Paul. I'll take the first one on ARPU. We think this is just a kind of great consumer satisfaction story for our Wireless business. And in a lot of respects, I think the ARPU story was sort of quite predictable. There were 2 key drivers over the course of the quarter to just -- to kind of bring your focus to. One is, those investments I spoke about, they really were focused on $50-plus rate plans. So everything from how we commission our distribution through to how we induce and incent customers, whether it's through financing or for subsidy, we're really focused and we'll continue to be focused on that higher value subscriber relationship. So we're dragging a significant number of new subscribers into the equation that are helping build that $37 historical number up to a much better figure like you've seen in the second quarter, you're at $38.50. Another thing that I want to focus on, and it's not as obvious from the outside, is that we've been actively upgrading our existing subscribers to our Big Gig rate plans. So we have historically had a relatively low migration history with our customers. That's always been sort of a net 0 for us as customers come in and out of rate plans, often related to their travel needs. Over the course of last number of months though, as we've developed this great value equation for our customers, we're seeing tens of thousands of subscribers move on a regular basis from a historical lower value rate plan into a new $50-plus rate plan. So there are sort of things happening above and below the line here that are contributing to that growth. And we think you'll continue to see from us those investments focused [not] on net ARPU growth. So I think that story will hopefully continue

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Strategy &amp; Business Development Officer   [39]

And Phil, it's Trevor. Just on the accounting, it's about $12 million in Q3 that we'll be booking for the retroactive impact of the lower roaming rates. And to Jay's comment, maybe it's not as big as people thought. It's about an annual impact of about $5 million in terms of what we'll see as the run rate going forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst   [40]

Okay. Got it. No, that's very helpful for those. On -- I want to ask a follow-up on the cable side. Obviously, you guys have shifted away from the promotions for the past quarter, recognizing that the bigger growth opportunity obviously lies in Wireless. Should we assume that this is the type of approach going forward? Should we assume the level of subscriber trends to be similar into future quarters? Or I guess sort of like it ebbs and flows a little bit depending on the market condition? I just want to get your take on what you -- where sort of subscriber retention and growth, where that's sort of lands in terms of your priority as it relates to the promotions that you're thinking through as the year progresses?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [41]

Phil, it's Jay. We will give you some color there. Clearly our growth opportunities exist on Wireless, as you've seen, and we're going to continue to lean into the Wireless opportunity. We continue to have a growth opportunity in Business as an opportunity to come up market in Business. And so don't -- despite the fact there was some slight moderating in our growth results this quarter and maybe next, you will see us continue to drive Business as a growth opportunity. There is lots of noise on the Consumer side of the business as you adjust pricing and promotional periods and competitive environment, and we continue to exist in a very competitive environment. So it's a little bit tricky to map out specific subscriber numbers in an area of very moving pieces. And I think it's clear that Vito's comments, that when we originally launched BlueSky, we wanted to duplicate the success that our American counterparts achieved a few years ago with the launch of the X1 platform and drive market share growth. And you've heard us communicate clearly to the team a year ago that winning looked like plus 1 in terms of video subscribers. It's clear as we executed that strategy that we got a different outcome and that, that was the strategy in the current environment, both with our competitive environment in Western Canada where people had already moved to smaller packages. And just everything that's happening in video today, which I think is global, not just a Western Canadian thing, that, that approach wasn't going to achieve the same outcome. So we've seen a shift video to more of a profitability approach, and you'll see us do that going forward. Whether or not you'll see a moderating of video RGU losses over the next coming quarters, it certainly would be our intention to do that. But we would do that within the context of profitability. The dynamics of our broadband business is good. What's fantastic about the Comcast roadmap is it's a total home solution, and the industrial design of that relationship with Comcast is terrific for us. And you'll see those benefits shift even more to the broadband solution and our broadband revenues going forward

Our next questioner in the queue is Aravinda Galappatthige of Canaccord Genuity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Suranimala Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD   [45]

Just a single question remains. Just wanted to revisit the comments you made about BYOD, obviously recognizing that it's not been a major drive in the last couple of quarters. But with the refarming done and some of the commentary we hear from a few players, that appears to be a meaningful opportunity, particularly for the regional wireless players. So should we kind of expect you to sort of apply more energy in that area as we kind of look to the second half for additional wave of sort of growth on the Wireless side?

Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [46]

Let me start, and I'll let Paul finish. Look, we hit a market seam where consumers felt mistreated by the way data was being offered by our competitors and the combination of that with the launch of the iPhone and energy in the marketplace, we hit a seam and we focused on that seam. And so you can only do so many things at once. The refarming actually helped us benefit our existing customers by moving them from 3G to LTE, and that helped us with churn benefits and other things. To say that our BYOD powder is still dry, it absolutely is, although, to be clear, you know the majority of our customers are in Ontario and we just completed that refarming in the last few weeks. Now there's certainly more opportunity on BYOD. By the same token, recognize that we love the characteristics of the cohort that's onboarding today, and we're not going to leave that alone in order to chase BYOD. We've got some levers going forward that you haven't even seen us use yet. I don't if you want to add to that, Paul

Our next question comes from Maher Yaghi of Desjardins Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [49]

I wanted to first ask a question on -- you mentioned in your prepared remarks that Q3 is still looking good in terms of wireless loading. If I look back to last year, we saw a slight decrease, 10,000 to 15,000 decrease in net adds. Is that what your -- what we should look at in terms of quarter-over-quarter type movement in net adds? Or there's something special in Q2 that took place that Q3 we should expect a more normalized level of loading? And I have a second question to just follow up on that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [50]

Yes. We've got great momentum, and we've had a nice start to the quarter, and things continue go well. We did -- there is seasonality in the business and you do have to look through sort of the adds in the business. Last year, we did 19,800, basically 20,000 in Paul's first quarter. He always rounds up to 20,000, but I'm sure it was 19,800. The -- we look at the pace that we're going. You can absolutely hold us accountable to double that. Could we do better than doubling that? We might do a little bit better than doubling that. But I don't -- I mean, if you think about something in the 4s, I would consider that to be sort of the current trajectory given the level of activity that we have in the marketplace. If you follow that seasonality curve, you should expect more from us in Q4 than that, because that's how the business unfolds. But I really don't want to get too speculative on guiding to specific numbers. In a very competitive and floating environment, we're going to do the right thing. Just wanted to give you some context of where our head is at based on what we're seeing today

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [51]

No, you actually did more than I had expected. In terms of your guidance, now when I look at your OpEx and CapEx savings from the VDT, which add up to $48 million, I add up the $12 million from the CRTC net back, you get -- you would get about $60 million, but you're sticking with your previous guidance of $375 million on free cash flow. Can you just try and explain what's -- what are the other things happening behind that is not helping in guiding up the numbers?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [52]

Yes. I would say one thing, Maher, is obviously the success of the Wireless business has near-term pressure on margins that frankly we didn't initially forecast. And we talked a little bit about the impact of the additional wireless equipment sales and there's actually a negative margin on that. So that is one of the things that's keeping us on the original guidance, along with some of the other favorable items, including the $12.5 million or the $12 million related to the onetime CRTC benefit. So there's a few things positive. But one of the things holding us back, obviously, is the success in the near-term margin impact of some of our Wireless activities, which we're very happy with. But that's why we're sticking with the original guidance that we have in place

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Strategy &amp; Business Development Officer   [53]

You know the other thing I'd add there, Maher, is the, as you've heard in our prepared remarks, how video is performing perhaps vis-a-vis our original guidance, is a bit of a headwind compared to that. But where we expect to come out of Q4 presents a very favorable picture going forward in 2019 and thereafter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [54]

Okay. Yes, that's what I have kind of implied because when you look at the -- if you allocate all the improvement versus your previous guidance, it comes out to maybe $150,000, $100,000 of higher-than-expected loading, which seems quite large. But yes, on the cable side -- I just want a final -- just one last question. When you look at your network, what are the additional investments that you feel you need to do in 2019 without -- I know you don't want to provide actual dollar forecast on CapEx, but maybe can you just tell us what are your big projects for 2019 on Wireless in terms of stores additions, network expansion, spectrum -- implementing new spectrums in your network, things like that, just qualitatively maybe

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [55]

Yes. Thanks for the question. Our plan has not changed. We're going to continue to execute the plan. I think there was some surprise maybe that in terms of executing the Videotron spectrum, we prioritized 2,500 before 700. I think that was maybe counterintuitive to people. I hope you can see today the importance of that in terms of what it does for our base in terms of being able to move them from 3G to LTE and the opportunity for them to come up market. I recognize people will have other views, that we should have done 700 first. We start at 700, and we are moving down that path as planned. And that will be the chunk of next year's Wireless spend. Throughout our segments, again, there is no forklift capital. We've got some VDP savings in capital. And so I don't think you'll see anything scary in our capital trend over the next couple of years. And when Brad talks about increasing free cash flow with or without Corus dividends, that's all part of our future as we move forward over the next few years

Our next question comes from Rob Goff of Echelon Wealth Partners. Our next question comes from David McFadgen of Cormark Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David John McFadgen,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Director of Institutional Equity Research   [57]

A couple of questions. So first of all, just on the Wireline RGUs, I was wondering if you thought that there's a path to get those to be stable. And I would think that if you actually had a Shaw mobile product and you bundled it with the existing Wireline services, that, that would go a long way to stabilizing those RGUs. Just wondering what your comments are on that? And then secondly, just on Loblaws, is the 100 locations a starting point? Could it grow to be something more significant than that? And are there other organizations that you're talking to that are similar to Loblaws?

Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [58]

Yes. Let me start on RGUs and will let Paul talk more about Loblaws. Look, there is lots of noise as we shift our approach to the consumer market, and we've got lots of work to do. Do we aspire to better RGU results than we got? Absolutely. And we're continuing to balance that. But when you think about Wireless, Wireless is the single biggest growth opportunity at Shaw. We don't think of it as a vehicle to stabilize Wireline results. We think it is the fundamental creator of shareholder value for our future. And so we're going to drive that as an absolute business with the level of focus and commitment that you've seen. Is there an opportunity to bundle? Of course, there is. Are there opportunities for us to do things in the future? For sure. Would we like to get a greater share of broadband adds than we got this quarter? Yes. But we're in a very challenging environment, and we need to -- we're not going to do it all costs. We're going to perform in a disciplined way and make choices in terms of where we invest. Paul, you want to talk a little bit about Loblaws

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO of Freedom Mobile   [59]

Yes, thanks, Dave. It's Paul. The 100 Loblaws locations, Mobile Shop locations, that's the total within our coverage. But we'll have those in a in-service fairly quickly in -- within this quarter. So that will be the cap of it. On other retailers, we're really fortunate that over the last number of quarters, we sort of demonstrated strong credibility. As you know, most -- there is a good percentage of Canadian wireless retail that's controlled by our competition. So we'll continue to be excluded from that, I would surmise. But there are certainly retailers of mobile in this country that are, I think, starting to recognize that we represent an important opportunity for them to provide value to their customers that otherwise doesn't exist today with the carriers that they're listing. So we're always open to the conversation for a place on their shelf and happy to take those phone calls as we have been in recent months

Our next question comes from Rob Goff of Echelon Wealth Partners

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Robert Goff,  Echelon Wealth Partners Inc., Research Division - MD, Head of Research, and Telecom Services &amp; New Media Analyst   [61]

My question goes back to a comment that was made on the impact of migrating Wireless subscribers. Could you perhaps dive a bit more into that and sort of weigh off the benefit to ARPU of migration versus the new subs coming on the $50-plus programs?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO of Freedom Mobile   [62]

Yes. Rob, it's Paul. Just maybe go back to the historical. We used to do a very small percentage of our subscriber base every month that would migrate. And the typical behavior would be, I'm on a $50 plan, I'm going to Florida. I'm going to go down to a $30 plan, and then when I get back, I'll jump back to the $50. So the kind of net over the course of the year for us was basically a null event. What we've seen of late is significantly larger percentage of our base every month migrate. And where it used to be a kind of 0 economic impact, our average migration right now is a positive, nearly $6. So you can imagine the sort of consequence of that. I don't have the number at hand in terms of the weighting between that and new. But we continue to recognize and see that our existing subscriber base sees incremental value, particularly after the refarming and moving to the Big Gig rate plans. So I would speculate at this point that over the coming quarters, we'll continue to see favorable migrations that will positively influence ARPU

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Vince Valentini with TD Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [2]

I've got 3 questions. I'll throw them out and let you guys chose the order you want to answer them in. First on Wireless, the ARPU, you jumped $1.41 from Q2 to Q3. That was more than we expected based on sort of what you'd telegraphed before of the ARPU for new customers signing out, but in the pretty small percentage of subs migrating from old plans to new ones. Can you give a bit of color there? Is it -- do you think this is sustainable in terms of a run rate increase sequentially? Are you seeing more migrations from the order plans to new Big Gig plans? That's question one. Number two, just your free cash flow guidance, Trevor. You've done $378 million year-to-date, so just wanted to confirm you're actually expecting negative free cash flow in Q4 to get down to the guidance of $375 million? And obviously, I heard your comment on CapEx trending up a little bit, but I would still maybe expect EBITDA to overwhelm that but maybe not. And third, internet, last year, it was a real anomaly, I guess, because of the big promotions around the BlueSky launch, when you added 20,000 internet subs. If I go back to the third quarter of 2016, you actually lost 8,000 internet subs, which makes the 3,000 subs this year look a little bit more, I guess, normal. Can you give a little more color there about exactly what's going on with seasonality and this bulk contract and give people some comfort here that negative internet sub adds is not what you'd expect going forward? Those are my 3 questions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO of Freedom Mobile   [3]

Vince, it's Paul. I'll take the first one regarding Wireless ARPU. Really pleased with the quarter's results. A few key drivers we just continue to see very, very positive inflow from higher-value subscribers. I think a few kind of highlights to point out there. We're now approaching 25% of our base on a Big Gig plan. Remind you that those plans didn't launch until October of last year. So those are all $50-plus plans. So we like the inbound quality that we continue to drive, and our distribution partnership has been fantastic in their support of helping us move up that, that value chain. Secondly, we continue to see improvements in quality on the device inflow as well. So we're now more than 1/3 of our subscriber base is on an Apple device and iOS device. We believe that there's a strong correlation between those devices and the higher-end Samsung devices that we're seeing brought onboard as well, the S9 most recently. So we just love what we're seeing on the inflow of new subscribers. And the trend that we articulated last quarter around positive customer migrations up to higher-value plans continues at the same level. So I think we'll continue to see momentum consistent with the last quarter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [4]

Yes. Vince, on the CapEx and the free cash flow guidance. In Q3, our capital spending was a little lighter than we originally planned, and that was just due to some slowdown in some deliveries and equipment. We do expect in Q4, capital to ramp up fairly significantly, specifically within the Wireless segment as we really accelerate the deployment of 700. We've kept the guidance language at approximately $375 million. No, we don't expect free cash flow to be negative in Q4, but we still do believe that free cash flow, maybe it's a bit higher than $375 million, maybe it's closer to $400 million because of that additional capital that we're spending in Q4 on Wireless but also on Wireline with some of the IPTV foundational investments

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [5]

And then it's Jay. If you want to talk about the internet RGU question. And Vince, I think, you're right. I think, our approach to launching BlueSky last year and the impacts are well understood was the tide that raised all boats, including internet. If you look at fiscal '16, if you look at fiscal '15, our internet results were not all that different. We -- Shaw broadband is a brand that always does well with Millennials. We do very well with students. It's a big part of our business. And we get to Q1 and Q3 activities, then I think it's well understood. I think as we've disclosed, there was a couple of 2,800 internet subscribers that was just moving from the way we deliver the service to fiber-based services and to different cloud-based services in universities. Our revenue is actually good on those accounts and our profitability is good there. So that's not a bad story. It's just moving from one way of delivering internet to another. For sure, there were some market dynamics, including attractive promotions from our competitors, different approaches. We certainly maintained our pricing and promotion discipline, which we're going to do as we go forward, but we need to focus on our execution to bounce these numbers back. I think, Brad was very clear that we're driving change in consumer in everything we do. We need to get better at our flexible pricing and packaging. You're going to see much more emphasis on customer segmentation, much more targeted and better bang for our buck on promotional spending and more on digital. But everything we're doing in Wireline is on strategy, and our focus is on Wireline margin. You'll see internet results bounce back to positive in next quarter, but we're going to stay the course

Our next question is from Jeff Fan with Scotiabank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director, Telecommunication Services and Canadian and U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [7]

Just on Wireless. Wondering on the subscriber side, if you can just give us some color on the contribution on your adds and improvement coming from gross adds versus churn, and particularly on churn. Given you guys have reformed some of your spectrum on 4G from 3G. Wondering what stats, if anything, you can share on churn and the network quality changes that you've seen in the last number of months and how you think that's going to trend going forward. And then the -- my second question is, I guess, a little bit more long term, given all the talks around 600 megahertz spectrum auction next year, given the U.S. deployment on 600 by T-Mobile, wondering if there's an opportunity here to deploy 700 along with 600 and whether there's enough of a timing there to allow you to take advantage of that spectrum even for, I guess, 4G, 5G, as you look out the next 1 to 2 years? I'm wondering if that's an opportunity to make a more efficient deployment as you continue to upgrade the network capacity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO of Freedom Mobile   [8]

Jeff, it's Paul. Yes, continue to be pleased with the contributions of both sides that has -- both in terms of contributions from momentum in the market on gross adds as well as continued improvements in retention. I think, last quarter, we characterized it as about a 50-50 split. I would put it in the same ballpark right now. We do continue to see sequential improvements in our churn rate, which we'll get more into that in coming quarters. But certainly, the Vancouver reform has helped us retain and improve the customer experience for a large percentage of our customers, and that's helped bring the churn rate down across both the pre- and postpaid basis. So that's, that's a very strong positive from our network team. And again, we continue to have good momentum in the marketplace. It's -- I think, I characterized it last quarter as not an all-out battle in the market. We're winning our fair share of gross adds. We're keeping customers at record rates for the company. Overall, that's what's driving the sort of blended contribution. And going forward, I suspect that'll continue to improve. Our new distribution partnerships will obviously bear fruit in time. I would caution everyone to be mindful that it takes a long time to stand up these partnerships for nearly doubling a number of retail stores that we have across the country. So that's likely to have a modest impact in coming quarter, but we're really encouraged by the, sort of, the key long-term support that'll bring the Wireless division

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [9]

And Jeff, just building on your capital plan. We're very pleased with our step-by-step plan, and we're continuing on that plan as we invest (inaudible) as it flows, having completed the reform, you'll see a significant 700 spend in Q4, which is all good spend and driving into next year. You have correctly identified that there are some capital efficiencies that are decently significant in deploying potentially some 700 and 600 together, and the network teams as they've made their plans for our build have incorporated the right way to do that. That having been said, the 700 deployment that we're doing is a value-based rollout that will improve our network as well. So we've got good visibility into what's possible. And I think the teams have got a great plan to integrate it

Our next question is from Phillip Huang with Barclays

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst   [11]

Question on the Walmart distribution. I think Walmart has about 260 locations. So is it fair to assume that, that 140 stores that you guys have with the partnership, are they mostly urban locations? And could we see the partnership sort of expand towards 260 in the future as you expand your network?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO of Freedom Mobile   [12]

Phillip, it's Paul. Yes, we have worked closely with the Walmart team as we did with the Loblaws team to ensure that coverage for Freedom is consistent with the levels we'd expect for their customers relative to the store footprint. So I don't know that you'll see any material expansion beyond 140. I would kind of characterize that as the likely near-term threshold. We'll get there in a fairly quick order once we execute, and it'll likely stay at that level for a number of years

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst   [13]

Got it. No, that's helpful. And any plans that you can talk to regarding corporate stores -- expansion of corporate stores?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO of Freedom Mobile   [14]

Yes. We've done a very thorough analysis of markets in which we feel that we have strong coverage for Wireless but perhaps inadequate corporate store coverage. And we think that -- we always characterize corporate stores as sort of the backbone of our Wireless distribution. They perform a fantastic array of services, and we've got a wonderful group today that I think overperform relative to their peer group. You'll see modest increases in those stores probably something in the order of 20 to 30 over the course of the next year, mostly just in filling whitespace where we believe we've got opportunity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst   [15]

Got it. No, that's helpful. And then one clarification on the churn. You said roughly 50-50 contribution from improvement in gross adds as well as retention. Do you expect that mix to change going forward or just because of the expansion of distribution? And also at the same time, you're also improving your network that you expect that sort of 50-50 split there to be maintained?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO of Freedom Mobile   [16]

Yes, it's probably a little hard to predict going forward. A couple of observations on either side of that. We're spending a tremendous amount of time and energy right now behind our retention and base management efforts, not just the work, but the network team have done a fantastic effort in terms of the reforming and improving our quality, which has just been a marked improvement over the course of the last year. But also just with the physical support and the team in terms of base management, we've kind of rebuilt that team over the last number of months, and we've hardened our capabilities there, and we've improved the infrastructure and the capability to monitor and track and support these customers through their lifetime. It's frankly much easier now as we brought on these higher-value customers to tracking through their life cycle than it was when it was a predominantly BYOD inflow. So that will be a big contributor. The wildcard in predicting the future percentages is probably around what happens with the expansion of our distribution. So there is the potential that, that could buy us more in favor of new gross adds, but I would still characterize it as in the ballpark of 50-50 over the coming next, say, year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst   [17]

Got it. Final question from me on the VDP side. Just because most of that program impact the Wireline segment, I was wondering if the departure's related to the GDP -- VDP was the fact that all in sort of the Wireline's less-recent consistent performance

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [18]

Yes, Phillip, it's Jay. We -- management certainly has been focused on our Wireline margin and VDP. And in the quarter, we did a new organizational structure. As you can appreciate, VDP results were announced on February 15. And in March and April, we did our detailed planning of the employee access, mostly upfront and did exits were in our leadership roles, and we focused on leadership and some corporate areas to start with. We've redesigned our complete leadership team with clear business units, leaders and accountability, and we're all focused on operational execution. We're in a period of change, for sure. The most important thing is the most important thing. And I don't think we've ever been closer to our business, and working with all of our teams and working through our operational execution. So I certainly wouldn't characterize any of this as distraction. I've never seen the organization more focused on what we're building and creating. But to be clear, we're managing an awful lot of change, and it's probably part of the story. I mean, if you think about our internet business overall, our internet business is healthy. We were at 6.3% year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter. We're at $66 ARPU before we entered the rate increase. There's lots of good things happening in the internet business. Would we feel better if we were plus 4,000 subs for the quarter as opposed to minus 4,000? Yes, we would. But we're not going to change our path just based on that single quarter result

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [19]

The next question is from Greg MacDonald with Macquarie

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Gregory William MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Head of Equity Research of Canada   [20]

Jay, just to ask a few more questions on the internet side of the business. Can you talk about specifically what the promo activity was, would you tell us and whether that's sustained into June?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [21]

Yes. I -- we're not disappointed with our June results to-date. And I think we're on track as you would expect due to kind of a bounce back that we would expect for Q4. Brad was clear that we need to get better in our execution. We need to get better on being targeted. I would say our competitor is best-in-class at targeting and segmentation, and you saw that in the quarter. We were in maybe a slightly more premium pricing position on internet in the quarter than would have been optimal. And that was just where we were in our step-by-step plans as we work our way through our adjustment. You'll see us in a very disciplined way address that a little bit in Q4. I think, we just have to take our medicine on a quarter that wasn't as good a result from an RGU basis as we want and go from there. I don't know that I would characterize it as super aggressive competitive action that changed that. We need to get better at playing the same targeted segmented game, and that's our effort, and we're going to

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Gregory William MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Head of Equity Research of Canada   [22]

And can you say whether DOCSIS 3.1 deployment was a factor in the quarter? I mean, is that -- and maybe you could just remind us where you are on that?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [23]

DOCSIS 3.1 deployment is going great. We're deploying DOCSIS 3.1 modems in the majority of our installs. The work that's been done on our network is fantastic. Because we've segmented a portion of the network for DOCSIS 3.1, it just improves network performance. We're entering a period not unlike we did with the new LTE network where the DOCSIS 3.1 network is an open highway that we can [load] customers and great experiences on. So we're delighted with the approach to that. We've got -- our supply chain has done a terrific job. We've got a couple hundred thousand DOCSIS 3 modems in the warehouse ready to go and more excited about what that phase makes possible

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Gregory William MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Head of Equity Research of Canada   [24]

Okay. Jay, and just lastly, it sounds to me like what you're saying is the TBT had some impact in the quarter in terms of the churn element. Am I correctly concluding that that's the case? And it sounds to me like you have started to at least successfully address this by your commentary that you've seen a bounce back in June. I don't want to kind of put you on the spot on details on that, but..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [25]

Except that you do

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Gregory William MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Head of Equity Research of Canada   [26]

It's my job to do that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [27]

Yes, I get it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Gregory William MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Head of Equity Research of Canada   [28]

Am I accurately describing that?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [29]

You've got elements of it right. If you look generally at the Voluntary Departure Program and the transformation efforts, I could not be more pleased with where we are today. That having been said, it's got complexity to it, and we're trying to do a whole bunch of things at once, a sequence of very exciting future for Shaw that is a wireless and digital broadband future with a wireless in-home experience connected to a DOCSIS 3.1 XB6, IP video, cloud DVR, all of the things that we're creating in our Consumer Wireline business is super exciting. And I'm so proud of our amazing team and the work that they're doing, lots of time with all of our customer service people. And you would be proud of the work that our teams are doing. So I feel really good about all of that. That having been said, there's a lot of activity in the business, as you can now expect, as we're focused on doing the right things. In fact, churn was down significantly on a year-over-year basis and continued its downward trend on internet. The miss was entirely to our plan on gross sales. And I think there was -- could you say that some of that focus hurt our gross sales activity? You probably could. That will probably be fair. In addition to that, we've been moving a bunch of levers all at once in a time of change, and we didn't deliver the sales that we needed to deliver. That's the easier lever to manage, and we're going to do it in a very responsible way. So I have great confidence that we'll bounce back to positive in Q4, certainly, Q2-type levels. But we're going to work our way through that. That having been said, a single quarter's internet result is really not the focus of our strategy. We want to take everything back up to our strategy. Broadband remains our key growth driver. We've got the ability to increase speeds as consumer demand falls, and we're going to continue to build on the XB6 and our digital broadband home with the stack of new services on top of that. So nothing in this is going to be a change of direction, just a little bit more focused

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Gregory William MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Head of Equity Research of Canada   [30]

That's really helpful. And just to clarify, the issue that you're talking about is a sales issue and not a technician install issue? Am I correct in making that assumption?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [31]

Absolutely. We didn't make as many gross sales. We actually have significant technician install capacity today that is available to us. And if there's any concern actually on the VDP conversations and the timing of technicians, the feedback that I'm getting from our teams, including our technicians, is we've got too much working notice inflection of the system, and we got a little excess capacity on the technician side, and that's what people are telling us. So there's no restriction there at all. In fact, we can move that up nicely

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [32]

The next question is from Tim Casey with BMO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Equity Research Analyst   [33]

Couple from me. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the enterprise side, both Wireless and Wireline? And are you pleased with your progress there? And with respect to Wireline, is -- the issues you talked about in internet sales, is that factored into that? Or is that kind of a separate unit? And then the other question would be relating to Corus -- your position in Corus. There's been some media speculation about potential sales there. I know you don't comment on rumors. But the narrative has been that you might be motivated to do that given your balance sheet yet. From our perspective, your balance sheet and cash flow profile doesn't seem to jive at that. I'm just wondering if you might want to comment on that or set the record

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO of Freedom Mobile   [34]

Sure, Tim. I'll take the Corus one. And as you said, can't really comment on speculation in the media. But I always look at it from a Shaw point of view. And as for Corus dividend, we've never included that in our free cash flow growth profile or never planned to. And when I look at our balance sheet and leverage, we're in great shape to fund our business plan and fund the strategic planning going forward. So we're very comfortable. And the last thing I'll just say, as I know Doug and team very challenging over there in that business and certainly wish them the best in continuing with that management

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [35]

And then, Tim, it's Jay, to talk a little bit about our business enterprise space and SMB. I think you've got very different dynamics going on there. From Consumer, we've separated those business units, and this business unit is in great shape under the leadership of Katherine Emberly and Ron McKenzie. Our sales funnel in Business is looking terrific. There is a sales cycle here for sure, but we're putting up big numbers in terms of the entries into the sales funnel, including in May and June, and the execution of the sales team in Business is going great. So you'll see that if that begins to ramp up again as we go. I think when you're looking at the revenue, we've got a couple of things still going on. We've got continued growth in our SmartVoice revenue. We've got continued growth in SmartWiFi, and it gets offset against some repricing in some of our legacy products, some of our legacy phone products, some of our legacy fiber products. This will -- the fundamentals of our Business revenue are strong. Our smart services are contracted as an average length of 45 months. They just continue to grow as a percentage of our revenues. Things like Shaw Broadcast satellite services continue to decline as a portion of our revenue. So I think, if you look at this 6% year-over-year growth, you can look at that and maybe a bit beyond as we move forward. As we think about Wireless in Business, yes, I think Brad mentioned at one of our conferences, there's certainly an opportunity for us to bundle Wireless services with Business in the future, and there's some work being done towards that. Today, we don't offer Business, Wireless services. It's possible a business owner -- or a small business owner is buying Freedom Consumer services and using it because it provides great value. But that's upside for us, and something that you'll see probably in the not too distant future

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [36]

The next question is from David McFadgen with Cormark Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David John McFadgen,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Director of Institutional Equity Research   [37]

I have 3 questions. So first of all, we saw the Corus dividend was cut yesterday. I was wondering if this has any implications for your dividend. Secondly, any idea when you would actually transition to all-IP solution for BlueSky? And then lastly, when do you expect to complete the 700 megahertz buildout?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [38]

Sure. David, it's Trevor. I'll -- let me talk about the Corus dividend. So Brad's comments were, going forward, we never really consider the Corus dividend as a meaningful driver of free cash flow growth over the long term for our company. And sure, the 80% dividend cut results in instead of roughly $90 million of Corus dividends coming to Shaw down to around $20 million. But we weren't including that to fund our strategic plans, growth profile or the Shaw dividend profile going forward. So it really doesn't have an impact on Shaw's dividend the way that we think about our dividend over the long term

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [39]

Great. David, it's Jay. I'll take the all-IP, and then I'll maybe let Paul talk about the 700 question afterwards. We're very pleased with what's possible for our Wireline business. I think, Trevor alluded to taking a major step in Q4, expanding up the cloud DVR infrastructure, which is what's behind some of the capital investments in Q4. And that'll be great to get that built up and up and running, and it really makes a lot of things possible. All of this that we're trying to create in our Consumer Wireline business and that the team is committed to creating, it's not really just about IP video, right, it's about creating this wireless and digital broadband company. It's about a gateway in the home, which is the XB6 DOCSIS 3.1 modem. It's about everything else in the home being connected wirelessly without wires in the home. That requires IP video. That requires cloud DVR. That requires us to make some evolution in our in-home WiFi, requires us probably to launch some of the xFi services that you've seen from Comcast. All of those things come together really nicely as you get through the fulsome of time in F '19. As you can appreciate, all the VDP and all of our efforts is in support of creating that in-service delivery model. So we're going step-by-step to make sure that we get it right with the change the model in order to make sure the inflation model works, the support model works, and we're working with all of our teams creating that road map. So I don't see that as a waste. I see it as a fundamental step-by-step plan where we create a new definition of winning. And I think you'll see all that come together into a new way for the house to connect with Shaw

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO of Freedom Mobile   [40]

David, it's Paul, on the 700 timing. We'll be making a meaningful start on that rollout this summer. And we expect that the work will be complete within 12 to 18 months

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David John McFadgen,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Director of Institutional Equity Research   [41]

And then, can I just squeeze in one more. You said 1/3 of your subs on Apple devices. Can you tell us what the average ARPU of all those Apple devices is?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO of Freedom Mobile   [42]

It would be characteristically slightly higher than the average, and that's probably as far as I'd go on that today

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [43]

Our next question is from Adam Ilkowitz with Citi

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adam Todd Ilkowitz,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Associate    [44]

A couple questions, starting on the Wireless side. Can you talk about the prepaid business and if you're shifting some of your, obviously, scarce promotional dollars towards the postpaid side? And are you seeing more of a competitive environment in prepaid? Or is that just more of a strategic shift? And secondly, when you look at the 600 stores that you will have in your footprint, how does that compare to the incumbents and obviously productivity in direct versus indirect is probably different. Are you comfortable with the mix on that and the productivity you're going to get on the store channels you'll have?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO of Freedom Mobile   [45]

Great. Adam, it's Paul. I think, it's worth an observation here on prepaid versus postpaid. And this is an area where investors may want to view us slightly differently than perhaps other carriers. We -- really Shaw [investors] believe that our growth can include kind of all Canadians, regardless of their economic status. So while you'll continue to see our primary focus be on the growth of these higher-value, lower-return postpaid subscribers, as we've been so effectively doing over the last number of quarters, we're going to continue to take steps to ensure that customers that have got credit challenges still feel welcome at Freedom. And the key in that strategy is to make sure that our investments in subsidy and financing and commissioning are aligned to customer value. We think there's (inaudible) to make that work, particularly using BYOD without really changing our risk or our growth profile. So we like prepaid. I would prefer to see us continue always be positive on prepaid growth, which is a bit of a departure from where some of our competitors are. We think it's an important part of the mix, and it's an important area for customers to graduate from. So we -- prospectively, I -- you'll see a mandate from us that likes to see us positive on both fronts as often as we can be. There's some seasonality that affects that detrimentally typically in 1 quarter. But if we could dream, we certainly would like to be positive on all fronts going forward. On your second question on the growth of the stores, you're right to identify that there's a productivity delta between our corporate stores and some of our better dealer stores and third-party retail, largely because of their focus. If you were in a -- identify first with Loblaws since we launched there in 15 stores now. You can buy any product there. The entire range of the Big 3, the -- from the premium brands right to the fibers and the flankers. So we're running perhaps 10 SKUs in those scenarios, and we're holding our end very, very well there. But from a practical standpoint, you would expect us to get a kind of a rate insurer or better slightly in that retail footprint as opposed to 100% of it goes to our corporate stores. So we love the confidence that we have from the management teams in those 2 retailers. We love what our initial trial has taught us from the Loblaws experience, and we work closely with that management team to learn from it. I won't try and contrast our retail footprint to that of the incumbents, other than to say, if you look at our results over the last couple of quarters, they have been driven by the fantastic work done by distribution. So I get asked a lot about, I think, our pursued distribution gap. I would characterize that differently, and say, we have opportunity to fill some whitespace, but we have really been impressed with the work that our distribution have come to -- come along with us on the journey up to our higher-value customers to improve the experience in store and to serve our customers better, and those numbers are showing in our quarterly results. So we're very pleased with our distribution at this point, and we'll continue to grow it thoughtfully over the next number of quarters

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adam Todd Ilkowitz,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Associate    [46]

And then maybe just for Trevor, on the free cash flow. I saw the cash taxes were obviously quite low this quarter, and deferred taxes are actually a positive on the cash flow statement. Is there any seasonality or timing to that? And then looking forward into the spectrum, as you think about your balance sheet, the leverage is quite low right now. What kind of leverage are you willing to go to for normal course and speed business, full spectrum? Is it up to 2.5x? Or is there any type of way to think about what you're willing to take the balance sheet up to?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [47]

Our leverage targets haven't really changed from what we've -- we sort of have as -- well, we stated in the past of 2 to 2.5x. We're certainly more comfortable at 2. We think it gives us the flexibility to run the business. But taking on some additional debt to fund the spectrum is something that we're very, very comfortable as a management team with. Nothing really out of the ordinary on cash taxes in terms of seasonality. We'll true that up though with year-end and give you the appropriate rates going forward when we talk about F '19 guidance

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [48]

Our next question is from David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David William Barden,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD   [49]

Just 2, if I could. The first would be, could you elaborate a little bit on the price hike you guys instituted on the Wireline side starting June 1? I went to the FAQ page on the website, but it says it's going to notify me my monthly bill, I don't -- I'm not going to get that soon, so I'd love to a little bit more color on that? And how you kind of square what you're doing on the pricing side with kind of what you hope will be improved broadband connections in the next quarter? And then the second question was, just on the Walmart kind of distribution expansion. Could you compare and contrast the economics of selling through the corporate store versus a third-party store, like a Walmart facility, and as we see a greater percentage of the distribution going in that direction, how does that impact margins?

Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [50]

Great. We'll start, David, with the -- with your questions about the rate increase. We did our annual rate adjustment on the Consumer Wireline side of the business effective June 1 with the majority of our customers being billed in advance, and even with our consumption billing customers, you get notified well in advance of that. So most of that has -- or all of that has found its way through the system. About 3.1 million customers and consumer are eligible for the rate increase, and about 1.1 million of those customers are in ValuePlans or in some form of late guarantee, so meaning they're not impacted. The general terms video is an increase of $2. Internet is kind of in the $4 or $5 range. Couple of adjustments in -- on phone. Think of that in terms of revenue impact for the business is being around $20 million, maybe $21 million in Q4. So $7 million -- $6.5 million, $7 million

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [51]

Yes. And I think we gave that color in the last call. But I think it was around $21 million to $23 million is what we're expecting in Q4 in terms of the financial impact of the rate adjustments

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [52]

Yes, and that implementation has gone well and/or everything appears to be on track. And if you look at an annual rate adjustment, I mean, certainly we see increases in our network fees and other things that are happening in the business, and this is sort of a normal course

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO of Freedom Mobile   [53]

David, Paul, on the question regarding Walmart economics versus corporate stores. I think there's a fairly simple way to view this. Our cost of acquisition expectations for volume going through Walmart are consistent with our run rate across the board. So we -- they are certainly going to be on a door-to-door basis, less efficient than our corporate stores, who of course do so many other things for us in terms of servicing our customers. But if you're working at your model, I'd suggest that you not expect it to have a material change one way or other in terms of our average cost to acquire a customer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) The first question is from Vince Valentini of TD Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [2]

Two questions, or 2 lines of questions. The first, just on market conditions and competition versus Telus. It sounds like Telus was pretty effective, or maybe you want to use the word aggressive, with their back-to-school promotions, and that may have impacted some of your cable subscriber numbers this quarter. Can you give us any sense of how that looks through September and October? Or do you see any stabilization there in promotional activity? Or is it still a pretty heated battle? And, given last quarter's communication, I'm not sure you want to answer this, but do you have any thoughts about what your subs may look like in Q1? So that's question one. I'll let you think about that for a second. On the second one, maybe for Trevor. I'm not sure I understand the composition of the EBITDA guidance and what you're saying about IFRS 15. So if I can try to characterize it this way, you did 32% EBITDA growth in Wireless in 2018. If you were to just do that again in 2019, that would contribute 3% consolidated EBITDA growth, and then you'd have a very small amount of growth necessary on the cable side to get into that 4% to 6% guidance range. Is that how we should think about it? Or is this IFRS 15 stuff or perhaps some extra marketing and distribution costs going to make it a bit more of a J-curve on Wireless, so that you'll see much less than 32% growth, and perhaps a bit more contribution from the cable side in order to get into that guidance range? If you can give any color there, because I really don't understand what the mix is of Wireless versus Wireline in that guidance

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [3]

Thanks, Vince. And maybe I'll start. I think -- I don't think we're going to get into too much granularity on the breakdown of EBITDA growth within Wireless versus Wireline, but directionally, you're sort of in the ballpark, I would say

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [4]

I'm sorry, I'm in the ballpark thinking another 30% -- so you're -- on wireless? Or is -- the whole thing will slow down because of marketing costs and IFRS 15

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [5]

There'll be a little bit of a slowdown due to IFRS 15 when we look at the reported results in F '18 and, later on, the impact of IFRS 15 in '19, but it sort of doesn't have that big of an impact, whether it's pre-IFRS or post-IFRS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [6]

I think if you look at the Wireline results, we've got, obviously, some really nice moves on the cost structures and really nice moves on the capital cost structure. I think what teams have probably missed is a bunch of our automation, both recurring and one-time investment, with Software-as-a-Service and a partner model, bunch of that hits OpEx in this fiscal year. So where you see a mitigation of CapEx to 19% Wireline CapEx intensity, you're probably seeing a little more OpEx onetime and ongoing investments in automation in this year than you were maybe suspecting, so that might be something that trends forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [7]

It's a good point. I mean, just on the VDP savings too, Vince, we always articulate VDP savings as net savings. Frankly, in F '18, the VDP savings, there wasn't a lot of net investments in those numbers. It was really sort of gross savings, where in F '19, we are starting to make some of those net investments to deliver the business with roughly 25% less people in the future

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [8]

And then to the first part of your question, Vince, I don't mind you characterizing our primary competitor's back-to-school efforts as effective. I think it's clear, in the competitive marketplace, when you win a cycle and when you don't win a cycle, and they absolutely won a cycle, so no excuses from our end. I mean, we have the benefit that, when we talked last time, we were still at the end of June, in the first month of the quarter. Obviously, we're a couple of months into a quarter now. We have tremendous confidence about our F '19 plan in Consumer, our F '19 team -- our team is in great shape going into F '19, we certainly hit all of our September numbers, we're doing fine in October. The business changes in F '19 for us; it becomes much more about monthly recurring revenue times our number of accounts times our average revenue per account. Obviously, broadband and satellite are what drives our Consumer account numbers, so primarily broadband. So we're focused on that, lots of focus on churn and customer lifetime value and segmentation. So some of the yardsticks move a little bit, but we're very excited, and, to Brad's comments, we couldn't be more pleased with how our team is coming out of this cycle and tackling F '19 in Consumer with a commitment for us to be effective

The next question is from Drew McReynolds with RBC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst   [10]

Maybe a follow up here, just to Vince's questions on the Wireline net losses. Appreciate your comments, Jay, on that. Can we just maybe drill down a little bit more? You obviously had some price increases in the quarter, you're staying price disciplined. Brad, you talked about kind of the execution, kind of challenges here. Was it solely competition? Or are there these other things here that are well in your control that you can certainly sequentially improve going forward? And just secondly, on the free cash flow guidance here, maybe for you, Trevor, just what kind of cash tax assumption we should be assuming?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [11]

Drew, we very much feel in control of our destiny and that we can improve sequentially going forward. We -- there's no question, we just did not get our share of gross adds. We had lots of capacity, we had the capacity to install, we had the capacity to answer our phone, we have the capacity to digitally serve our customers -- we're doing 28% of our installs on a self-installed basis now -- so we've opened up a tremendous amount of capacity. So the engine's ready to go, and I think we control the levers. In hindsight, obviously, if I had it to do over, we did our mass marketing spend around the 300 launch in September, which I think was effective. It's pretty clear, based on the results we got, we probably should have -- if I had that to do over, I'd have spent a couple million dollars more on marketing in August. And we would would've been -- we would've gone at different outcomes. Our whole plan is around growing monthly recurring revenue, and you can't do that without growing Internet subs. You know, if you think about our Consumer business, we had a little over $300 million rounding the bases September 1st, the monthly recurring revenue. We're going to use that number, the entire team, every single day, and the path to success in F '19 includes growing broadband customers every quarter. In the medium term, we're about 2 quarters behind Comcast's roadmap, and we think they're cutting a nice path for us to follow, and we love the work that they're doing on their strategy and excited to bring those innovations to the Canadian market place

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [12]

And Drew, it's Trevor. Just on the cash tax assumption. Yes, I know it’s difficult this year. Obviously, our effective tax rate showed quite high because of some things that weren't tax deductible, like the Corus write-down. But our statutory tax rate is about 27%, and for cash tax purposes, it's roughly 300 basis points, around 24%, that you can model for going forward

The next question is from Jeffrey Fan with Scotiabank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director, Telecommunication Services and Canadian and U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [14]

Going to ask a question about Wireless and, more specifically, in terms of the contribution to your nets this quarter, whether you're seeing an equal distribution from churn reduction and gross adds? Or was there any kind of skew towards one over the other? And then, the second part to the wireless is just whether you guys are happy with the pace of loading that you guys are seeing on gross. And maybe comment a little bit about -- I know you don't disclose churn yet, but wondering if you can comment a little bit on churn and the outlook there. And then the second question is on cable. And I guess if we sit back, right now, you're getting pretty decent financial performance in cable, but the RGUs are obviously not coming through. If we look back a little over a year ago, you were kind of the opposite. When do you think we could get to a point where we've got some balance between those 2? Because I think, really, what the market is truly looking for is just some balance, and to avoid sort of going back and forth between RGUs and financial performance, which we've kind of done over the last couple of years. Wondering if you can kind of comment on the timing, when we can get back to that kind of level place

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO of Freedom Mobile   [15]

It's Paul, I'll take the first series of questions on wireless. On the contribution to the nets, I think I characterized this, the figure, as -- about as a split a couple of calls ago. I think in Q4, we saw probably slightly higher bias towards contribution from gross, where we were very strong. But as I'll come on to in a minute, we did continue to see a very, very positive churn profile for our base. So I would have the contribution slightly higher on gross than on net in terms of the lift over last year. Pace of loading, we're very pleased with, and a couple of observations there. For the entire quarter, for all working purposes, the flanker brands all had a double data promo, which is really thoughtfully designed to sort of camp into our space of data-centric subscriber acquisition. And we competed very strongly against that through the course of the quarter. As you can see from the metrics, we're very, very pleased with where we got to on gross. We also had an opportunity for the first time in Q4, to look in earnest at how we competed in a multi-carrier retail environment, with Loblaws having been in play for most of the quarter, and then, just as we've rounded in Q1, with Walmart. And while we'll get into the detail more, probably on the next call, we were very pleased with our share of gross in that multicarrier setting. So we think, sitting side-by-side on a shelf with all of the other brands in the wireless market place in the markets we compete, we performed very strongly. We will disclose churn on the January call, but I'm pleased to say that we continue to see record levels of retention performance across our wireless business, largely fueled by the fantastic work we're seeing from our network team. Can't say enough about the improvements I've seen in my 18 months here. This is a completely different product experience than it was even a year ago, and it just goes from strength to strength. In recent weeks, as you know, Jeff, we've introduced the 700 spectrum across most of our Western markets and part of the Southern Ontario market, and the consumer response to that was immediate and strong, so we're continuing to invest in that customer experience, and it is flowing through to our churn results. So not specific guidance, but I expect to see that metric come in on a good plane in January

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [16]

And then, Jeff, to your comments -- and thank you for your comments on the wireline side of the business. I don't disagree with your characterization of the past couple of years. I -- we're feeling great about how we have entered F '19. We're really -- it might sound funny to say, we really feel like a new company as we round the bases in September 1. We've got a new super lean structure. It's just me and 4 executives in the Consumer business, one who leads growth sales, one who leads base management retention, one who leads marketing, and pricing and packaging, and one does the important job of managing all of our programming costs. Super flat organization, almost no other leaders in Calgary, everybody's embedded with every channel, doing their job, making a lot of headway on base management and segmentation. I think -- I believe our objective on the Consumer side of the business is deliver a boring and financially strong year that is also strong in terms of our long-term number of customers, but -- think you'll see that from us starting in Q1. When you talk about RGUs, we don't really think of the business that way anymore. We think about the business in terms of how many customers we have, what they pay us on a monthly basis, what's happening to our subscription revenue base of monthly recurring revenue, what's happening to the churn, how do we manage our base on a daily basis, a lot more segmentation. So I think, certainly, in terms of broadband customers, you'll see a much more balanced approach to our result. And look, our path here isn't that hard. We don't need to shoot the lights out on revenue growth. There's things happening in the Home Phone business, there's things happening in the television business. The small revenue growth on the Consumer side, steady, works with improving margins and the opportunity to realize all the cost structure that we've got, a much, much tighter and more effective capital structure, and we've got a real nice business here that's a lot simpler than it used to be, and we're very proud of what the team is executing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director, Telecommunication Services and Canadian and U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [17]

If I could just follow up quickly. I don't know if you have this number handy or if you track it, but some of your peers, particularly in the U.S., tracks the customer relationship number, which kind of, as you alluded to, kind of takes away from the RGU. I don't know if you have that kind of, directionally, whether you're seeing stable in customer relationship growth or decline. I'm wondering if you can share, I don't know, if you track that at this point?

Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [18]

Yes, we do. Our Consumer business was up slightly in terms of customer relationships, F '18 over F '17. We have just over 2.8 million customer relationships, and our average number of accounts over the year was 10,000 higher in '19 than it was in '18. And I think on the cable side, when I say cable and broadband, that's very much our plan going forward. And if you think about customer relationships, we have a seasonality to our satellite business, you'll see that in Q1. We were seasonal as ever in Q1, so you'll see that in the numbers. And satellite customer relationships might drop, say, 35,000 for the year. But our satellite business is fine and stable and profitable, actually. ARPU was great, so I wouldn't -- I don't think that's a big issue. On the broadband cable side of the house, we maintained our customer relationships this year and certainly plan to do the same in F '19

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [19]

The next question is from Phillip Huang with Barclays

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst   [20]

Also a couple of questions on the wireless side. I was wondering if you could give us some color on your, perhaps, performances in different regions. I suspect Ontario is still generating most of your volumes, given the market size, but could you call some comment on the pace of the growth in Alberta and B.C. relative to Ontario? And then, another question I had was on the demographics of customers you guys have been able to attract. Have you noticed any sort of change or expansion in the types of customers been able to kind of reach, just given the network improvements. Any sort of addition of business customers, et cetera, that you have noticed?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO of Freedom Mobile   [21]

Phillip, Paul. So starting on the regional performance, we've seen a relatively static sort of split between the East and the West, which is characterized, about 70% of our volume coming from the East and 30% from the West. I will say, having spent some time over the last sort of while, improving a number of things in the West. We've turned on, as you know, the 700 spectrum most pointedly in the West. That's the vast majority of the investment we've made in network on 700 is coming in the Western part of the country. We've also got a significant advantage in our WiFi footprint in the West. So while the bias hasn't changed very much over the course of the last year, expect to see additional strength in the West as we look to deploy and leverage some of those assets into our proposition. It has been -- we've been waiting for 700 to roll out, but you'll start to see some changes in that split over the course of the next couple of quarters. On the characteristic of our base, I think a couple of data points are worth pointing out here as we look across the changing nature of our base. So, probably the first thing I'd point to is the average selling price of our devices. So, if you go back a year, we have doubled the average selling price of a phone, so we're a little north of $800 now. A year ago that number was about $400. Just a dramatic change in the characteristics of that. As you can imagine, that is largely driven by the iPhone influence, but these are customers that a year ago, we simply weren't appealing to, and now find the appeal in Freedom significantly greater than they did 12 months ago

I'd also point out that, while it's not in the release, our porting ratios, while they have long been in our favor, really changed significantly. When I look at -- I'll pick on the fourth quarter of F '18. In F '17, we did about 7,000 net ports, so -- the people porting to us in excess of those porting out. In F '18, we did 36,000 net ports, so a 500% increase on the behavior we're seeing, and that's reflective of 2 important things: one is, the confidence of competitive customers to make a change and bring their number to Freedom, a huge change in the business; and the other is -- again, that, too, is the work our base management team and our network team are doing -- a greater confidence of people to stay. So we love -- we watch our porting ratio very closely, it's widely available industry data, and we love where that's taking us, but it broadly suggests that we're seeing a different characteristic of customer. And again, I'd just point to the -- as a final thing, the onboarding value. In the fourth quarter of this past year, we set yet another record for the value of the recurring MRC that customers were committing to, and that figure was up about $1.50 over the prior quarter. So, we're doing all the right things on directing our investments in subsidy and in commissioning and in effort to rate plans and structures that provide us with better economic result

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst   [22]

That's very helpful. If I could, just one more follow-up. I mean it seems like the natural question to ask at this point, given your -- you also mentioned WiFi in your response. When is the right time to launch a premium brand? It seems like all the ingredients are kind of in place and your network is rapidly improving. Just wondering if -- I know you don't want to dilute Freedom's momentum that's been sort of gaining over the past year. I'm just wondering if you could comment on when would be the right time to start introducing a brand that you could -- that you feel comfortable bundling with your fixed line base

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO of Freedom Mobile   [23]

Yes, Phillip, I think I'd characterize this still -- and I'll use the same line I've used for a part of the last 2 calls -- it's dry powder for us. We love what we're seeing from the Freedom brand and how we're penetrating across all of our points of distribution today. We clearly understand that there's an opportunity for us to introduce, perhaps, some new branding into the marketplace at a time that suits us, but at this point, nothing to disclose on that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [24]

The next question is from Sanford Lee with Macquarie Capital

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sanford Lee,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [25]

I had a question for you guys just on the sustainability of the ARPU growth. Obviously, a lot of stuff is coming in at the $50 and above. Is there any of the ARPU benefits coming from the customers that are migrating up from lower-tier plans?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO of Freedom Mobile   [26]

They are indeed. We -- I think we announced previously that our migrations were coming in at around the $7 mark. Over the last quarter, that number has moved up favorably to about $8 and change, so it takes, obviously, a lot to move that base significantly, but we love what we're seeing on that front. So the -- both the number and the value of migrations are increasing. And as many of you may have noted, in July, we had the opportunity to make some changes in our Big Gig rate plans. We introduced a $5 charge, incremental charge, to the rate plan levels that were set back in October. We then gave customers the opportunity to discount that back by taking advantage of our digital discount and moving to pre-authorized payment. We love the characteristics of customers that are on PAP, and we'll continue to incent that. But that series of rate plan changes has produced a number of favorable impacts for us in terms of -- really, it's both wins. Whether a customer takes it or they choose not to take it is kind of a win. So where you're seeing a slight rate increase, we're seeing a longer-term digital relationship with us that we think has other benefits. So overall, migrations are a very positive part of our story

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sanford Lee,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [27]

Right, and then kind of related to that, I know you recently launched a lower-cost -- $25 and $15 -- ARPU plans. Can you give us a sense of the uptake of that, and, again, looking to potentially migrate them up the chain at some point as well?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO of Freedom Mobile   [28]

Yes, and thank you for bringing that up. One of the things that's important that isn't lost in our very strong Q4 results, the 9% ARPU lift that we were able to present to the market included the launch -- although it's a relatively small numerator, but it included the launch of rate plans that were significantly below our base average, so in some sense, pushing in the opposite direction. But we have a very, very clear direction from leadership here that we want to make wireless available to all Canadians and to do so in a way that is consistent with both our objectives of reaching lower-income Canadians and, certainly, with what I believe to be the government's view of trying to make wireless and data-only plans available on a more broad basis. You'll have seen that we launched those plans directly into a time when the big 3 were less enthusiastic about that market. We are enthusiastic about bringing all Canadians to Freedom, so we took the opportunity to do that. I think we helped maybe change that, the view of that marketplace. And, while the loads are relatively a small percentage, a sort of a single-digit effective gross for us on the quarter, they are an important part of telling our story across the broader segment of the population

Operator   [29]

The next question is from Aravinda Galappatthige with Canaccord Genuity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Suranimala Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD   [30]

Two for me. Number one, just wondering if you can just touch on sort of the operational sort of impact of the VDP plan. Obviously, you're sort of getting to that midpoint in terms of employee exits and sort of transition. Can you just talk about how you've been able to sort of manage the operational disruption? And should we think as though -- that the higher-risk component of it being behind us? Is there sort of more to go? And I'm trying to sort of connect that with, maybe, some of the, I guess, the relative underperformance on the cable gross adds side. To what extent did the size of the program perhaps affect the sales aspect of -- on the cable side?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [31]

Yes, great. Thank you. Brad talked about, in his comments, just how amazing our people are and the work that's been done in changing the company. Where we are today -- not to minimize what the organization's been through over the last 6 months, our people are amazing, they're the source of everything good at Shaw, I love where our team's at. I can't remember a time, certainly in the last 10 years, where our team has been in better shape. The team's embraced this troupe of 10,000 call to action. We're a smaller organization now. And when we talk about a troupe, we're not talking about a military troop, we're talking about it like a traveling performing troupe where one week you're on lights, and another week you're the star, and crates lift themselves because everybody helps. It's right consistent with the Shaw culture and how we were built. Our organization is doing tremendous work. In the process that has been so energizing for our team because decision-making has all moved to cross-functional squads with agile 2-week sprints. And I spent a few days in Edmonton last week -- the turnaround with our teams in Edmonton -- about our ability to just get things done effectively because our teams that are doing the work are changing the way we work. So I couldn't be more happy with how we're coming out of the, as you described, the higher-risk area. The plan's going forward. We've still got some work to do, but I would actually characterize us as being slightly ahead of where I thought we would be at this moment; self-installs of 28%, headed to 50%, all of our digital initiatives are going well. I think if you look at our underperformance over the last couple of quarters, some of that may well have been all of this adjustment. I suspect more of it was all of the changes in management and leadership and restructuring and streamlining. I'm sure some of that had an impact. Most of the heavy lifting is behind us. We've certainly got some automation investments this year, and as you -- we've got a clear line of sight to our VDP exits, certainly for, at least, the first 9 or 10 months of this year. We've got a little bit of work to do as we do the final sort of departures into 2020. But we're super pleased, and we will -- as difficult as this process has been, it has not only enabled a fundamentally new cost structure for our Wireline business but it really has enabled a new Shaw in the way -- in the modernization of how we do business

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Suranimala Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD   [32]

And just a quick follow-up or second question for me. I think I may have not heard correctly, but I think you, in your prepared remarks, you talked about, I think, about 28% of your installs now being self-installs, which sounded like -- which, certainly, to me appears to be a good number. Can you just talk about sort of the potential to sort of increase that over the near term? And is there a component -- is there a prospect of maybe the X1 installs also becoming self-installs in the near term?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [33]

Yes, for sure. I mean, the whole spirit of the Voluntary Departure Program was because of this fundamental change in the business where the only thing plugged into the wall will be an XB6, and everybody -- everything else is IP-based experiences connected wirelessly. And you can start to see the beginnings of that in Comcast's results and what they're doing. And that's actually behind the whole direction that we're going as the company. That 28% is the right number in terms of self-install. In May, it was 17%, so we're directionally headed in the right direction. That probably looks like 50% at the end of the 2020 program. The number of truck rolls that are being avoided by that are -- will be in the hundreds of thousands. It's super material of a plan, and it just gets easier as we launch our IP-based experiences, and you've certainly seen, I mean, the road map is clear. You can see Comcast doing it. You can see Rogers doing it. You can see Cox doing it. We're on the right track here

The next question is from Tim Casey with BMO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Equity Research Analyst   [35]

A couple for me. Just -- you mentioned, Brad, in your opening comments about how you're going to start doing cross promotion. Just wondering if you'd comment on how you're going to approach that, given your other comments with respect to recurring monthly revenues because, obviously, cross promotion can often include bundling discounts. And second, just a comment on your spectrum road map. I know you can't comment on 600, but how are you thinking about mid and higher bands, given that's clearly where the focus of the incumbents are? Just how are you thinking about that going forward?

Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [36]

Tim, I'll start here, and I'll take your last question on the 600. We're extremely excited about the 600 and the auction coming up, and we really applaud the government for stepping up with a pro-competitive spectrum plan and policy. So we're excited about what that brings, and as you know from our spectrum holdings, low, medium, high, very important as we go forward. And hopefully, as we step into the next couple of years, that the government still has that pro competition, and then we really believe that spectrum is critical as we compete with the big 3, and we're going to be very focused on that going forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [37]

Great. It's Jay. In terms of the cross promotion side, I think, as you heard in Brad's comments and you can see with the increasing wireless capital that we're investing this year, we've got some really interesting things happening in Alberta and B.C. One is significant network improvements. And so we're really getting there with the launch of our additional spectrum. We're also launching a significant number of new markets in this fiscal year, which really will cover our footprint much more dramatically. I think the West is going to matter more to Freedom in this fiscal year than it has in the last number of fiscal years. We're going to step into this. I don't know that -- to Paul's comments about dry powder, I don't think you'll see massive bundling opportunities in F '19. I think you'll see us try and have conversations with customers about what they're spending on a monthly basis and how they can bring Freedom and Shaw together to help them save money. I don't think you'll find anything scary in that, and really excited about what happens this year for us, Wireless, in the West

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Equity Research Analyst   [38]

Just a follow-up if I could on another road map, that being your all-IP experience. I think in your opening comments you talked about it in the second half. Can you give a little bit more color on how that's going to roll in?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [39]

I think I previously said we're about 2 quarters behind Comcast on their technology road map. And in general terms, if you think of it that way, you'll -- you're in pretty good shape. Just -- it's actually quite easy to see what's coming in terms of our product offering. I think it's fair to say in terms of the -- both the operational and market impact, that the bulk of our all-IP experience will impact the second half of F '19, but we certainly are very pleased with how things are developing and are in testing. And we're certainly technologically ready. Speaking plainly, we've been helped by the aggressiveness of Rogers and their rollout in driving IP, that just makes it easier for us. And it's nice on some of these things to be quick second. The first go-around, we were leading into Canada and having to sort all that stuff out ourselves. So we benefit from this expanded syndication in Canada from Comcast and are excited about what the second half brings

The next question is from Maher Yaghi with Desjardins

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [41]

Jay, I wanted to just -- can you -- you were talking about your marketing spend in the quarter that you could have pushed up a bit more in order to alleviate some of the losses you had on Wireline. How much did you say you could've spent more in order to prevent these losses?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [42]

Thank you for the question. I was -- clearly, we believe that we had a go-to-market that would enable us to get our share of gross adds and not to have a decrease in broadband customers. And so what I did say is our mass sort of campaign -- and mass isn't as important as it used to be -- our mass launch of Internet 300 we did in September, because it's a great opportunity to sell and set up things for F '19. My comment of -- and that campaign was about $2 million that we spent in September -- my comment was: you learn from your mistakes. Clearly, we should've put more in market in August. We lost August. And so if I had it to do over, would I had moved that $2 million into August? Yes, I think that's self-evident now. In the medium term, it's timing, and we're pleased with our mix of 300, and we think both the pricing parity that we've got through Internet pricing and the launch of 300 and the mix of the buy-in of 300 is all going well. So I think it, in the long term, will come out in the wash. But it's clear we had a light marketing spend in Q4, and you'll see some of that, timing-wise, impact Q1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [43]

And so why didn't you spend the money? Is it because you were trying to meet some object -- financial objective for the year?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [44]

Yes. No, we didn't spend the money because we think the best time to launch 300 and our new way of being is in September, and we've got good market impact from that. We certainly had room, in terms of spending the money, it wasn't that we were up against a particular number. We're delighted with the financial result that we've taken. We believe, as you heard from our comments in June, and this is the nature of a very competitive environment, we believe we had a plan to deliver our share of gross adds, and it didn't turn out that way. So we're committed to achieving better results in the future, Maher

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [45]

Okay, so that's on Internet. How about TV, because I guess both go hand in hand? But there's an abnormal decline in TV that happened in the quarter, and it's hard to call it just on back to school, because a lot of these subs that go in and out on the back-to-school period are mainly Internet and not heavy on TV, from what I understand, if it's -- we're talking about students and universities. So how -- what's the strategy to turn around the TV portion?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [46]

Yes, and thank you for question. And actually, I agree with where you're heading as a hypothesis. I don't see the change in TV -- in video RGUs. And I think we're talking about cable here, so let's..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [47]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [48]

...as opposed to satellite. I think you're right that, that's not a change in back to school. I think you and I may have different expectations for where we're heading with video RGUs. Obviously, the biggest challenge that we had in F '18 financially was a degradation of our video gross margin, primarily on the cable side. We've said, clearly, we're going to manage video for profitability. We've got a cost structure that, the way channels are packaged, suggests a certain way to market video. We're going to have a much healthier margin story in video in F '19, and that will be part of our total customer story. I would hesitate to -- if you're trying to work a model -- to suggest that we're going to have a major bounce back on how we characterize video RGUs, because I think if you follow the map of managing video for profitability, total number of customer relationships or accounts, our monthly recurring revenue model, it doesn't necessarily take you to quickly improving RGU numbers in video

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [49]

Okay. And you know the general expectation was that X1 was going to help you in some way improve your video situation, and that's not happening. So that -- I guess you're saying that the market misunderstood where RGUs were going on the TV side. Can you maybe help us understand what your view is for 2019 on that, because I think the general understanding is that you were not going to lose more than what you lost in the past?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [50]

Yes, I wouldn't use all the same words that you just used there, but the way we think about the business as we move into F '19 is, our Wireline business, we're looking in that 1% to 2% revenue growth. We got 1% revenue growth in Q4. This is what winning looks like. We do that by managing our monthly recurring revenue. So our monthly recurring revenue is just, when we entered the year, just a hair over $300 million. And monthly recurring revenue, every single day, we're looking to grow monthly recurring revenue by $1. And we do that by growing our broadband customers, becoming more profitable, reducing our churn, a much more sophisticated base management and segmentation. That strategy will work. It will deliver the long-term revenue of the company. The monthly recurring subscription revenue is what the Wireline business is. Is that a shift in our management approach from sort of the historical cable RGU approach to the business? Of course it's a shift. It's part of how we've reengineered the whole company in the next 6 months -- I mean in the last 6 months, and so you'll see that throughout F '19. To my comments to Jeff, I think you'll see a very balanced approach to the marketplace. I think you'll see us grow revenue by small amounts at a steady basis with decent improvement in gross margin and significant improvement in overall Consumer profitability, and I think that bodes well for the future of our company

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [51]

Okay, and one last question on this topic, and I'll move on. What's the marginal contribution? Can you help us understand how much is TV RGU losses affecting EBITDA in marginal -- the marginal impact? Because when you're looking at the mix, so with a minus 30,000-something TV, it's hard to see how that can be made up with mid-single-digit Internet growth unless the mix is really lopsided on the margin side

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [52]

Yes. And I mean, I think it's a helpful question. And you can see we're making lots of changes in mix to the marketplace. We, in F '18, saw a material degradation of our cable video margin, and we saw a significant increase, obviously, in our Internet revenue, all of which drives the margin in F '18. That ended up being a degradation of overall gross margin, and the offset in F '19, we plan on improving gross margin. I think you can do the math. I'm not sure it's totally helpful for you -- me to give you the actual gross margin numbers, but they are significant. We saw a slight decline in satellite video margin, but it really wasn't the problem. The problem was, overwhelmingly, cable margins. There's no question, we didn't help ourselves. We drove to choice packaging in the world where our cost structure really doesn't facilitate gross -- choice packaging with penetration base-rate parts and so forth. So I mean we got squeezed badly F '18 in video, both on loss of customers and loss of margin. And when..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [53]

And loss of ARPU

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [54]

And loss of ARPU. And when all those are headed in the same direction, you can appreciate the magnitude. And as you can see, Internet didn't fully offset it -- offset that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [55]

Okay, that's -- and sorry, just one last question. On your guidance for '19, how should we look at the growth year-on-year, the 4% to 6%? How is it split, let's say, first half versus second half. Is? Is it early? Is it back-end loaded, front-end loaded? How can -- just helpful on that. That would be good

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [56]

There's -- it's a little bit more back-end loaded, Maher, but not to the extent like it was in F '18. We do have some of the investments -- timing related to those investments of both the VDP, sort of net investments in technology and automation and things that Jay said. A lot of those are coming in, in the first half of '19, so you will see a little bit of additional operating costs in the Wireline business in Q1 versus the run rate in Q4, but not to the extent that's -- that this year was, in terms of '18, in that volatility in the quarterly split

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [57]

Okay. And this guidance of 4% to 6% is based on the current accounting standard, or on IFRS 15?

Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [58]

It's the same under both

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [59]

Okay, so no change. Even though subsidies on handsets is quite high on -- in your current situation, it won't affect the growth percentages?

Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [60]

Correct

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [61]

The next question is from Rob Goff with Echelon Partners

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Robert Goff,  Echelon Wealth Partners Inc., Research Division - MD &amp; Head of Research   [62]

It would be on the recurring revenue side of things. Could you give us a bit more perspective in terms of the Consumer rate increases? I think you noted that it added an incremental $4 million during the quarter. What was the timing of that perhaps and the component mix of that? Second question would be on the Business revenues. Ahead 6.6% on the quarter, you attributed that to the SmartSuite. Could we look forward to greater momentum behind that product suite?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [63]

Yes, Rob. It's Trevor. Just on the rate adjustments that were implemented June 1, they were about $21 million in the quarter, sort of Q4 versus Q3. And just for benefit, it was about $12 million on Internet, $6.5 million on video and roughly $2.5 million on Home Phone. So that was the rate adjustments, and you saw that really flow through the quarterly Q4 revenue versus Q3 revenue. Most of that was driven by those rate adjustments. I think we delivered $19 million in total, but it was $21 million offset with a little bit of migration from customers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [64]

And Rob, this is -- we've got real nice momentum, Rob. We've got a SmartSuite of services and greater opportunities in enterprise. In our maths, though, it's a little offset by our one legacy business, Shaw Broadcast Services, that relays satellite services for broadcasters. That is obviously in structural decline. So if you look at the rest of the business, we're looking much more like high single-digit increases. I can't tell you how I love the energy of the Shaw business teams, and we had a record sales month in August. Of course, that leads us a couple months down the road on revenue, but we've got rate momentum on Business. And when we talk about our lowering Wireline to 19% capital intensity, we're certainly still continuing to increase our success-based spend on Business, so that mitigation is on the -- becoming way more effective in our capital intensity on the Consumer side. Super excited about the story in Business. I mean, things are going so well on Wireless. We don't talk about Business very much, but we are committed in F '19 to have all 3 business units contribute positively to our operating plan and have all 3 business units be very successful

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [65]

The next question is from David McFadgen with Cormark Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David John McFadgen,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Director of Institutional Equity Research   [66]

So first of all, just on Wireless, when you talk about expanding into new markets in Western Canada to capture an additional 1.3 million customers, are you moving into rural areas? And what is the ultimate ambition here in terms of your footprint in Western Canada? And then secondly, on Wireless, could you tell us about what are the gross adds ARPU is? Just wondering where that's tracking because, obviously, it has implications for Wireless ARPU growth

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO of Freedom Mobile   [67]

Dave, it's Paul. Thank you. Your -- I wouldn't characterize our ambitions as rural in Western Canada. The markets that you'll see us move into this -- in this coming year are places like Victoria and Red Deer and Lethbridge, some major markets that we're not currently covered. So we're very excited to be able to bring Freedom service to those markets and think that we'll very quickly achieve a good share of gross adds in each of those places. On gross adds RPU, yes, our inbound subscriber cohort is coming in -- as I said, in the last couple months, it's come up by about $1.50, so it's in the low 50s, and that's on MRC, so I'll be careful on characterizing that between -- in ARPU. There are some discounts that sometimes apply, and then there's also things like roaming and other charges that will -- could kind of push in the other direction, so characterize that as probably MRC equating to about ARPU. But we're very pleased with the numbers we've seen, particularly since the July rate changes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David John McFadgen,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Director of Institutional Equity Research   [68]

Okay, and if I just have a follow-up, just on the cable video ARPU. Like if you look at Comcast, they've characterized their video sub losses as traditionally lower ARPU. Would you say that as well for you, that any cable video losses you're experiencing are more on the lower end of the ARPU range?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [69]

There lots of moving pieces in terms of our video ARPU. I'm not I would say it in exactly that way. I think there is no question that the future of our business and our whole F '19 strategy is that we're going to lower our cable video churn and add a lower number of gross sales but much higher value customers in video. So I would certainly say it that way. Maybe that's a little bit of a spin of what you just said, David, but I wouldn't characterize it quite the way you said it out loud

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [70]

Mr. Shaw, there are no questions at this time. This concludes the time allocated for today's conference call

 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [71]

Great. Thank you, operator. Thanks, everyone, and we'll talk to you in January

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Drew McReynolds of RBC Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst   [2]

Just want to hone in here on wireline, maybe for you, Jay. Obviously, very good margin expansion in the quarter. I think in the past, you alluded to seeing more of kind of that margin improvement in the back half of '19. So just wondering if you could kind of provide an update on what kind of investment in automation you made in the quarter as well as perhaps how programming costs are expected to trend for the rest of the fiscal year?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [3]

Great. Thanks, Drew. Well -- it is Jay. I'll start with that, and Trevor can fill in on some of the timing of the second half investment. I mean, we're very happy with the first quarter in terms of wireline. We -- the team was all in its new roles and largely aligned as we went through the summer, so we brought our -- this was the first quarter of our transformed organization, and we liked the results that we got. We see opportunities for improvement and continue to want to grow broadband and to grow revenue through our focus on transformation

I think on the investment side, to your comment, our net investments, where we achieved our gross savings in terms of investments, we didn't really reinvest that much in Q1, and the timing of our net investments in the second half

Trevor, did you want to..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [4]

Yes. Drew, I think, it's true and maybe there was some confusion about absolute EBITDA growth versus growth rates. Clearly, there were very strong growth rates this quarter, but just caution going forward. We're lapping some pretty strong quarters in the second half of '18

In terms of reinvestments, there wasn't as much as planned this year. We certainly are -- still being cautious about VDP and just managing through the exits. We -- there was about 200 folks that exited the business this year. There's another 900 to go in F '19 with majority of that back half weighted in the second half. Roughly 700 of those 900 will come out, or leaving then. Majority of those folks that are leaving later in the year are certainly more on the operational, technical -- technician staff, so that's more CapEx related

But some of the investments related to automation of processes, self-install, field force optimization and some of the digital initiatives that we're tackling, we're -- we are sort of being very dynamic as the leadership team and looking at these on a weekly, monthly basis. We expect those to come, but it'll come later in '19 than originally planned

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst   [5]

Okay, that's great. And one final one. Also on wireline, we saw a bunch of pricing, packaging, speed changes to what you're offering out there in the market. I know you talked about in your opening remarks but maybe if you could provide little bit of the impact that you've seen on RGUs or whatever traction you've got as a result? Just any color there would be helpful

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [6]

Yes. Drew, it's Jay again. I think you've alluded to we made a couple changes. We made a Internet speed change right at the end of the quarter, which really had no impact on Q1. It was literally in the last 2 days and will impact Q2

Basically, we really wanted to reinforce our position in fiber to the home and fiber to the node as we lead in to our broadband strategy, giving us what we believe we can market as absolute parity in the fiber to the home areas and 4x faster than fiber to the node. It affected almost half of our Internet customers, a little less than half about -- approximately 900,000 residential Internet customers, and response has been extremely positive on the double down, both in terms of the reaction from our base and increased activity into our inbound digital and call center channels

In the following week, we also made our planned moves on video, which is really, as we've talked to the markets about in the past, we're really focused on managing video for profitability, eliminating the reprice for us and improving cost predictability for videos. So the focus is on $60, $80, $95 plans. And again, we were pleased with the early response for December. So that's kind of an exciting time for our wireline team, very much the first chapter of the book, but it's great to see the business responding as we planned for it to respond

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [7]

Our next question comes from Vince Valentini of TD Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [8]

Let's stay with that wireline pricing theme for a sec, Jay. I assume you've seen some notices going out by Telus for rate increases in Internet primarily and a little bit of video for the end of February. Any thoughts about that? Does that strike you as a nice reaction to what you've been doing the past couple of months? And can you give us any update on what your rate increase upgrade cycle might be this year?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [9]

Yes. Thanks, Vince. I think we continue to have a nice competitive pricing for every -- pricing for the business and then decent price discipline in the marketplace. In terms of rate increases, you'll recall, we did a -- what we used to call the cable segment, the consumer broadband segment we call it now, did a rate increase last spring, and probably you'll see something along that regard this coming up spring. Because we don't rate increase within a value plan, it's only a portion of the base that gets rate increase, and I think Telus is making similar moves

As we did last year, we did our consumer satellite rate increase last year in the winter, and we did this December 1 as well. It went well. On average, it's a $3.40 increase effective December 1, and it'll probably contribute about $20 million in F '19 revenue. So that's where we're headed on pricing. I think what you've seen is all of our pricing is focused on broadband. If we need video to get a broadband customer, we're going to add video absolutely in a profitable way, and it's an important part of our business. But we're pleased with where both we are and the market is right now from a pricing perspective

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [10]

Great. Two other ones if I can throw out, one for Paul, one for Trevor. Paul first maybe. The churn improvement year-over-year is obviously pretty substantial. At 1.28%, you're almost down to the level where some of the incumbents are, but Telus is below 1% consistently. T-Mobile in the States is below 1%. Do you think 1.28% is sort of as good as it gets? Or you expect continued gains from this level in future quarters?
 And then for Trevor, just you can think about it while Paul's answering that, is -- I mean, 15.5% is not just slightly above your guidance. I understand the timing on some of these (technical difficulty), but is it fair to say 13.5% is trending towards the higher end of that 4% to 6% guidance range for the year on EBITDA? Or do you still think that the midpoint of that range is most realistic?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [11]

Vince, it's Paul. Thank you. Yes, we're obviously thrilled with the performance of the team, the infrastructure, all of our customer contact points that got that 1.28% figure in place for us over the last 90 days. I would expect to see some volatility, simply, mainly 2 reasons

We've got a smaller base, so it's a little bit easier to affect that with small movements, and we've got a higher percentage of BYOD on our rolls than the incumbents do. So I'd expect to see a little bit of movement, but I'd characterize that range as something we look to aspire to for the rest of the year. And I'd like a kind of 30-year head start to get to sub-1%. I don't think you're going to see that any time soon given the composition of our base

But these are really significant improvements we've seen. And it's full credit to the network and engineering teams that have so drastically improved the network experience over the course of last year. You'll continue to see our churn level be in that range, I think, over the next couple quarters

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [12]

And yes, Vince, I would say, based on the delivery of the Q1 results and where we sit, that yes, we are trending towards the high end of the guidance range

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [13]

Our next question comes from Jeff Fan of Scotiabank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director of Telecommunication Services &amp; Canadian &amp; U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [14]

Few questions. First let's just clarify with Trevor. With respect to the IFRS, there seems to be some confusion on that, so I just want to clarify that. In this quarter, there were some margin decline, I guess, on a year-over-year basis. But that seems like from your explanation is just due to the fact that you didn't have a lot of subsidies in your base in Q1 last year

So as we look out the rest of the year, should we start to see margin improvement on the Wireless side as you start to lap, I guess, the iPhone handset and the subsidy model that started late last year?
 And then, again, the $30 million adjustment in 2018, only $1 million in Q1. How does that roughly split out for the rest of the year from Q2 to Q4? And where do you think the number ends up roughly in 2019?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [15]

Sure. A lot there, Jeff, and I understand there is some confusion with the policy changes on IFRS 15 that makes it difficult to do comparatives

So on the margin question, you're absolutely right. There wasn't as much sub loading in Q1 of last year, so that's why there was a stronger margin than this year. I would say, where we're looking at sort of trending through the balance of the year is somewhere in that 16% to 20% with the sub volume that we're expecting. However, that trend changed significantly based on higher sub volume and more subsidy upfront on the equipment side of things

As far as this split on the $50 million and the $30 million, you're absolutely right. Again, Q1, there wasn't as much activity. Really this, I would say, roughly half of the $50 million impact on revenue and half of the $30 million impact on EBITDA occurred in Q2 when we really started to ramp up the volume and the device sales and the subsidy related to the activity a year ago

So hopefully that helps from a modeling perspective that you can do your adjustments on IFRS 15 for '18 on a quarterly basis based on Q1 disclosure we gave today and the Q2 is roughly half and then Q3 and Q4 is about the remainder split evenly over both of those quarters

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director of Telecommunication Services &amp; Canadian &amp; U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [16]

Okay, great. Question for Paul on the Wireless side. If we look at your postpaid adds for this quarter, the last 12 months, you're adding almost close to 320,000 subscribers. You're growing ARPU at double digit now. How do you feel about that level of pacing and growth and the balance that you're seeing on both of those metrics? And just wondering how things may kind of shift as we look at the rest of the year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [17]

Yes. Obviously, a very strong 12 months. Difficult to predict, Jeff, going forward. As Brad indicated, the -- we had somewhat measured and somewhat quieter holiday selling season relative to last year, so a bit early to predict. Of course, there has been some speculation in the media that there's been sort of a flattening out of smartphone replacement cycles and things, so that may impact sort of our forward-looking 2019 numbers

We're continuing to see strong growth, particularly in that mid- to upper segment for us, so we're continuing to pursue sort of a higher quality subscriber than we were even at this time last year. That may moderate some of the growth figures that you talked about. But as you saw in the last 90 days, we've been able to kind of continue to power through that

I'd say at this point, we're comfortable with our growth. We've got some new markets coming on that should help. We've also got some things pushing in the other direction, a little more disciplined and a little more thoughtful inoculation from the incumbents to some of the more at-risk subscribers that they have. So that's making for a little bit less available market

On the other side of that, we'll be opening up more than 1 million new PoPs this year as well. So I think the next 90 days will be a strong indicator of how the year will play out, but we continue to think we're going to have a good, solid growth pattern for '19

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director of Telecommunication Services &amp; Canadian &amp; U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [18]

Okay, great. And just one final question on the wireline cable side for Jay. There was a mention in the MD&amp;A about subscribers migrating downward the video packages, so that's sounds like cord shaving

I'm wondering, are these subscribers seeing their content costs go down as well, i.e., are you able to maintain, I guess, the gross margin or gross margin dollar from these customers even as they migrate down or whether there's some flexibility that you don't need on the content side to try to drive that or maintain that profitability?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [19]

Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeff. I think as you've seen what we've done on video pricing, it's designed to really provide great value for our customers almost on a cost-plus basis to our cost structure. One of the challenges as you've watched over the last 2 years with our BlueSky entry into the marketplace is we really emphasize choice beyond the flexibility that we had in our programming agreements. And we saw over the past 2 years, a significant degradation in our video margin and also in our video revenue

Q1 was a very positive turnaround quarter for us in cable and video. Where we still had some much more modest declines in revenue and margin, we started to move forward. And the beginning of December looks extremely positive with video as we bring pricing back in line with our cost structure and providing value to our pay TV customers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [20]

Our next question comes from Aravinda Galappatthige from Canaccord Genuity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Suranimala Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD   [21]

A couple questions on the Wireless side. Number one, just wondering if you can sort of revisit the geographic mix. I know you've in the past been alluding to sort of still being heavy on the Ontario side, perhaps 2/3. I wanted to see if that changed materially?
 And secondly, I think in the past call you alluded to some initial assets around cross-selling in the West. I wanted to see if there's -- if that program has commenced or if there's any early feedback. I'll leave it there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [22]

Aravinda, it's Paul. The split between East and West continues to be 70-30, where it's remained for quite some time. I do expect to see some changes in that as soon as in the coming months on a modest basis as we open up the -- some of the Western markets, including Victoria, which will light up in the coming weeks. And we'll see about 1 million of the 1.3 million PoPs that we add this year with a bias to the West, so that will start to have a bit of an impact on that split. But I wouldn't imagine that that's going to move in a meaningful way for a little while yet

On cross-selling, we began -- really our first effort on that was just to sell Freedom products within a Shaw store here in Calgary at Chinook mall. Very, very pleased with the first 60 days or so of that. We'll look to continue to expand the availability of Freedom product within Shaw's retail footprint over the coming months

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [23]

Our next question comes from Maher Yaghi of Desjardins

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [24]

Guys, I wanted to -- as you continue to drive Internet into your overall mix higher, and as you alluded to trying to work out the profitability on the video side, can you talk about your expectations for revenues on the consumer side for the rest of the year? We saw results holding steady on the top line consumer in the first quarter. Can you maybe just tell us how it's shaping up for the rest of the year?
 And on the business side, what are the improvements or the potential upside we should see in that growth that we saw a nice uptick in the quarter. Can you talk about what's to come maybe for the rest of the year?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [25]

Sure, Maher. It's Trevor. Maybe I'll start and then Mr. Jay will add some things here. But on the wireline segment, our focus really remains on stabilizing the business, improving execution and growing broadband. And certainly this quarter, we delivered on that. From a top line perspective, I would say, we continue to expect consumer be roughly flat and business will contribute mid- to high single-digit growth. And frankly, Maher, we've done that on the top line for the last several quarters. So I'd say that will continue to be the focus and what you can expect from us over the remainder of F '19

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [26]

Okay. And in terms of Wireless, you talked about the split 70-30 from Ontario. Do you see a difference in customer mix in terms of ARPU levels in Ontario versus Western Canada?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [27]

Very modest. There's a slight increase in ARPU in the Alberta market relative to the rest of the Canadian market. But on balance, it's all within pretty much striking distance of each other

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [28]

Okay. And in terms of the retail strategy, you -- how long you think it's going to take before we see an uptick in the retail segment in Western Canada from the investments you've made so far?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [29]

Well, they're relatively early. So the new markets that we're opening are really just starting in the coming weeks, and you'll see that continue through the course of F '19 into F '20. Our retail investments there, I think we've indicated in the past that we'll be opening around 30 to 35 corporate stores. About 2/3 of those are in the West, and again, those are all in front of us at this point. So you'll start to see some modest shifts in the retail percentage of contribution over the coming couple of months

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [30]

And the focus there, I guess, is mostly on the postpaid because it seems like you were ready to lose some prepaid customers in the quarter to focus on postpaid. What do you think we should be expecting on the prepaid side in the next couple of quarters? It seems like the competition is trying to impact your low end, which is a bit weird for me to understand, but what's your expectations on prepaid?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [31]

Yes. You'd have to ask them about their intentions. As far as our strategy, we are -- I've spoken previously on this call about how pleased we are with the evolution of our corporate stores and our distribution partners on the pursuit of higher-value postpaid subscribers. So I think it's consistent with our strategy. We've asked our distribution to remain focused on that higher value segment. We'll continue to welcome customers of all preferences for payment mechanism over the next number of quarters

As you know, Maher, we launched in July some entry-level price points for data-only subscribers. We're seeing some of those come in on a higher basis of prepay. But overall, we want to continue to focus on the highest value subscriber that we can secure, which is a customer that comes in on a 2-year device financing arrangement on a Big Gig rate plan and signs on to a high-value device

So that's really been our sweet spot. I like the way we're moving up into the higher-quality subscriber profile. But we will always make sure that we've got an entry point for prepay lower revenue subscribers as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [32]

Okay. And just last 2 quick questions here. On the prepaid losses, the 20,000, how would you say the split was versus the conversion to postpaid and lost to competition? And on the ARPU growth rate, now that you lap some of the entry points on iPhone, how we should look at or expect to see ABPU growth in the future quarters?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [33]

Yes. The split was of the losses we incurred this year -- this quarter on prepay, a little more than half were attributable to customer migrations to higher-value postpaid plans. A lot of that was attributable to the incentive that we provided customers to move up and to commit to a higher monthly recurring revenue with us through things like the Big Binge Bonus. So we made it appealing for customers to move up and spend more with us this quarter, and we were grateful that they had the confidence to do so. We saw about roughly 10,000 of those 20,000 losses would've been attributable to competitive losses

On ABPU growth, I don't think we're guiding at this point on that. We're obviously continuing to see our focus be on sort of $50 and $60 subscribers, so you can build your own model on that, but we'll -- you'll continue to see us focus on the Big Gig pricing. And as I said, I think, a couple calls ago, I'm not going to get bored of that anytime soon. It's working for us. Customers are finding it appealing

We're continuing to hear from customers that they love the option of being able to get out of a scenario where they have excess overage charges, and we're going to continue to poke at that. We believe that that's an aspect of the competitive environment that we just find unconscionable, and we're going to continue to leverage that. So customers are voting with their feet and with their wallets. They're staying in record numbers. Now you can probably build your model to support that

(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from David McFadgen of Cormark Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David John McFadgen,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Director of Institutional Equity Research   [35]

I have 2 questions on Wireless. First of all, do you know when you would be done say 80% or maybe 100% of the deployment of the 700 megahertz spectrum?
 And then secondly, just following along the ABPU growth, can you give us an idea what the ABPU is on your postpaid gross adds because obviously that would have implications for growth in the future

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [36]

Yes. I'll take those in reverse order and then, Trevor, do you want to take the second one? So on ABPU growth, the inbound cohort continues to be in the low to mid-50s over the course of the last quarter, so we're seeing new subscribers come on, on those Big Gig rate plans at well above the reported ABPU so like the trend that that's putting in place for us

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [37]

Yes. On the 700 roll, David, I mean, obviously, that's the focus for F '19. We get a big chunk of it done this year, but just to be clear, it will spill into F '20 as well in terms of the investments

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David John McFadgen,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Director of Institutional Equity Research   [38]

Do you think you would have 80% of the deployment done by the end of say..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [39]

That's a little bit high in terms of by the end of this year, David

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David John McFadgen,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Director of Institutional Equity Research   [40]

Okay, okay. And then maybe if I can just follow up with another one. So when you're colocating Wireless and wireline in, say, a Shaw retail location, how -- like how does that benefit wireline at all or wireless? Like can you give us any more details there? They're not on the same bill, right. They're just colocating

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [41]

Yes, they're not on the same bill, and you're selling Freedom and Shaw services. They're not on the same bill thing I'm not sure is a totally modern thought. I think that may be a little bit how the marketplace used to operate

It's a simple conversation. It's an opportunity to have a conversation with customers in Western Canada on what their monthly spend is on both broadband and wireless and take the asset to the organization to save the customer money. We're doing it in small baby steps. We're doing it at moments of truth as you onboard customers; and as you save customers, reduce churn; but it's very helpful for the conversation, David

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [42]

And David, it's Paul. Things like being able to profile hundreds of thousands of WiFi hotspots available to our Wireless customers, attributable thanks to the investments we've made on the wireline side of the business. It's a nice cross-sell there, and customers are reacting well to that

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jeff Fan of Scotiabank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director of Telecommunication Services &amp; Canadian &amp; U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [2]

A couple of questions, one on the cable side with video and then another on wireless. Just on the video side, I understand the strategy is to not chase after some low ARPU video subscribers. That's obviously not having much of an impact on financials. But strategically, as you look ahead with more customers looking for more flexible TV packaging and TV products, like the one that you actually offer with free range. I'm wondering if that becomes more of a strategic focus for you to try to go after that market, especially given your competitors out there with a skinny product like PIK? And then the second question on wireless is, just on the state of the wireless industry, I think given that the incumbent seem to be quite focused on churn that's having an impact on volume and the overall market, part of that is certainly seasonal but I think that may continue through the rest of the year. I'm wondering from Freedom's perspective, how do you operate? And are there things that you think you can do to try to stir the market a little bit to drive some volume from Freedom's perspective?

Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [3]

Thanks, Jeff, and it's Brad here, I'll start first. I think for us at Shaw, the advantage and benefit we have with our Comcast strategic partnership is that they get to go first with the new products and services, and we can learn from that and come in behind and look at what works best for us. I think as a partner of Comcast, we certainly would -- the Flex TV service would be available for us that Comcast launched if we desire to roll it out to our customers. And listen, it's very interesting product as you look at just what's happening within the market, and for those customers that don't take a traditional video package, I think, it could be quite interesting. So we're going to take it and have a look how it fits into both our road map, how and when, because I know that Comcast just launched it on the 21st of March, so this is something we're going to take a closer look at

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [4]

Jeff, it's Paul. On the stir the market that you say, we've seen pretty significant investments from the incumbents on retention, and you've noted that in some of your recent reports. We're doing a number of things to stir the market right now in the back half of the year. You would have seen the launch of a new campaign over the last week, kind of featuring the fictional model of big wireless and kind of reminding Canadian consumers that there are strong alternatives and better value in the marketplace. And that's a big part of what we have to do is to continue to make sure that our message is out there, and the availability of affordable, large big data buckets is there for everyone within our service footprint. We also are continuing to benefit from a very strong referral base. So as our network matures and improves, our existing customers are increasingly coming on with additional lines, and we're seeing a strong amount of referral volume coming out of that source. And then the last thing I'd say is, we're continuing to make solid deliberate efforts in the growth of our retail distribution. We've opened a number of new corporate stores over the course of last 6 months, we'll continue to open those over the back half of the year. Adding Mobilinq is a nice addition as well, and we'll continue to expand our distribution, both for postpaid and for prepaid, making sure that more Canadians have the availability of access to Freedom services

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [5]

Our next question comes from Sanford Lee of Macquarie

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sanford Lee,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [6]

I had a question on 2019 guidance. I understand that, obviously, the H2 becomes much tougher as far as comps goes. But if my math is correct, it looks like even at the high end of guidance for this year, that can imply -- that's a negative 0.7% in H2 '19. So I'm just wondering if you can comment on your expectations because you're obviously hoping to be above the high end, I think, on guidance?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [7]

Yes, sure. Thanks, Sanford. You are tracking well but there are some investments that they're going to accelerate in the second half. We haven't made that many sort of VDP-enablement investments, that's going to be about $10 million to $15 million in the second half, probably more weighted to Q3 versus Q4 and that's on the OpEx side. Also, some higher marketing spend. We haven't -- the marketing spend has been a little bit lower in the first half of F '19 compared to historical amounts. We, obviously, had some onetime favorable accounting adjustments that hit us this quarter. So all told, we still feel comfortable with our existing guidance. But clearly, we're trending towards the top end. And then, obviously, I would say just on the volatility within the wireless business and what's going on with the dynamics, it's hard to sort of pinpoint exactly what that looks like in the second half. But we do feel comfortable with our current guidance. And if warranted, this is something that we'll probably adjust or we'll take a closer look at Q3 just as we're through another quarter of VDP transition. It's a big quarter for us in Q3, there's about 375 exits in Q3, another 305 exits in Q4. The majority of that frankly is within our operations team, it's about 65% to 70% of the exits in the second half is in the back -- pardon me, is in the back half. So we're being agile, obviously, with our investments but we still feel comfortable with the current guidance that we have out there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sanford Lee,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [8]

Okay, great. And then if I could ask one quickly on the wireless ARPU, not the ABPU but the ARPU itself. I mean, I guess we are used to the company trending at 7% kind of growth range and, obviously, a lot of higher promos in the quarter that sort of thing, so down to 3.5%. It doesn't look like the wireless environment is kind of getting any easier as far as ARPU goes. Can you give us a sense of, I guess, maybe where the competitive environment has been tracking in this current quarter?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [9]

Yes. Thanks, Sanford. Two points on ARPU. One is just a reminder that we're continuing to see kind of the build-up of the subsidy amortization it's kind of flowing through that. We aren't fully through our 2-year build of that, of course, so we don't have a benefit of customers that have rolled off the amortization so we're still seeing sort of an ever-increasing amount of impact on that. So that will get better over the course of the next year, but it won't be better in the next 6 months until we hit our 2-year anniversary of the launch of the iPhone. On the broader market, we actually have seen a little bit more pricing -- sort of more rational pricing over the course of last 30, 45 days. During the second quarter, particularly in December and January, we did see kind of narrowing of our price umbrella relative to the incumbents as it kind of was well reported. That's come back up a little bit over the last sort of while, so the discounts that impacted ARPU and ABPU over the course of the last quarter, we think have moderated somewhat in recent weeks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [10]

Our next question comes from Aravinda Galappatthige of Canaccord Genuity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Suranimala Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD   [11]

A couple from me. First of all, I know a couple of quarters ago, you've talked about initiating certain cross-selling sort of processes. I wanted to get a sense of what it is in your early feedback and what sort of potential is there? And how would you kind of look to ramp up those initiatives? And secondly, on the wireless margins, I know you alluded to that in your last answer but pretty good number service margins of about 31%. If you kind of track some of your comps that even in fairly limited scale have got to sort of the mid-40s in terms of margin. I wanted to get a sense of how you see that tracking over the next couple of years? Are there sort of any fixed step costs that will probably cause an up and down sort of trend there? Or is there sort of a fairly sort of a steady line in terms of margin expansion going forward?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [12]

Yes, it's Jay. Super quickly on cross-selling. We're very much in early days, as I think we mentioned on the January call, we'd open the Chinook store that it's a combined Shaw and Freedom location in the quarter. We also opened Metrotown in the Lower Mainland. And initial trials are extremely positive, it animates the Thor, spent a day in the Metrotown store and it's exciting to be able to talk both products with our customers and make sales. That having been said, we're not contributing a meaningful portion or even close today to pause overall numbers. But it's a nice test for the future. I'll let you take that margin question

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [13]

Yes, it's Trevor. Maybe just, Aravinda, on the wireless margin service, we don't see a material step-up in the service margin in the foreseeable future but it's -- we're sort of taking a slow and steady approach as we go about next year. And I don't want to -- I don't think we want to get too much into guidance looking forward beyond F '19. But for the remainder of F '19, I think we talked about it on a consolidated basis within our margin. Within wireless, we sort of see a high teens to low 20%, and we continue to see that in our plans going forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Suranimala Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD   [14]

Great. And just before I wrap up, any change in the geographic mix and the gross adds in wireless?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [15]

It's Paul. Very modest changes, we opened up the Red Deer and Victoria markets, which have both performed strongly in the first 6 or 8 weeks. Of course, that was offset by the opening of some Eastern Ontario markets in March as well, so no meaningful change yet on the quarter-to-quarter distribution of that. But over the course of the next year, I do expect to see that move a couple of percentage points in the favor of the West

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [16]

Our next question comes from Phillip Huang of Barclays

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst   [17]

A couple of questions from me. First is I wanted to get your take on the launch of xFi and BlueCurve later on this year. I was wondering how you expect these new products to potentially change your -- or improve your subscribers on the wireline side? And then I have a follow-up on the wireless side. I was wondering if you could provide an update on the potential to introduce a premium brand into the markets. When do you feel would be the right time for that to happen?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [18]

Thanks, Phillip, it's Jay. On your question of xFi and BlueCurve and subscribers, I mean, we're quite excited with where we are in the business. In Consumer, we've had pretty strong financial quarters, we moved back Internet growth in Q1 at 5,600 and Consumer a little better than 11,000 net in Q2. The -- our full philosophy around fiscal '19, we got together with every people manager in the Consumer business in September action part sale and we reorientated the business around profitability, which you've seen in our results. And for us, profitability means monthly recurring revenue, churn and growing our Internet customers. We're actually having good success on all of those things. And I think it's very difficult to read through on the subscriber numbers and understand. I think to Jeff's comments previously, you can see it in the profitability numbers. I'll just say quickly on video because I know it's a matter of discussion, we're not unhappy with where we are in the video business. We've achieved our video revenue every single month for budget this year. Our video ARPU held up nicely in the quarter, and disconnects of cable video decreased 24% from Q2 last year. As has been widely reported, we're not chasing on profitable subscribers, and cable gross adds were 43% lower than Q2 last year, satellites doing great, video ARPU grew nicely and disconnects were also down year-over-year. Wanted to note that if you look at our fiscal year and our plan, and we've made our plan every month in video, including March. If you look at our plan, we have the same video profit margin combined to have light and cable in Q4 as we do in Q1. So we actually maintain video profitability throughout the year. And I know it's hard for you to see that in the subscriber numbers but that's the power of segmentation. To your question about the BlueCurve launch, I mean, we're super excited about how it animates the space and it's a chance for us to take our brand, and Shaw is still a loved brand, consumers in Western Canada like that we take our shoes off at the door and that we take care of our customers. In recent years, the tech and product performance wasn't leading in the market and so BlueCurve is a chance for us to get -- step further, more confident. Modern Shaw is a performance brand and it embraces not only the network but the gear and the overall experience and it's really about shifting your speed coverage and control. Clearly, it also generates new revenue models and you've seen our new video pricing, you've seen our new Internet pricing as -- video was December and Internet April 4, the opportunity to sell BlueCurve Home, the opportunity to sell BlueCurve Pods. While they don't directly reflect subscribers, I think you can see what they do to monthly recurring revenue. And so we're pretty comfortable, it's little-by-little, step-by-step in the consumer business but we're pretty comfortable with the trajectory we're on that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [19]

Phillip, it's Paul. On your question on the premium brand, we're really pleased with the growth story we've got on Freedom and it's doing a great job in our life, very efficiently of covering segments right from entry-level prepay up to those $60-plus subscribers that we've been happily loading over the course of the last number of quarters. So for now, that the Freedom brand is doing a really good job of bridging across multiple value segments and we're happy with that. We've been holding on the launch of a premium brand until such time that we're satisfied that the network will support that in the way that we want that story to be told. So nothing to report other than to say that we think patience is the right approach here. As we mature the network, we'll have that option to bring to market later on

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst   [20]

That's very helpful. I just have a quick follow-up, perhaps for Jay. On the wireline side, obviously, you guys have shifted focus on broadband marketing to better capture the broadband-only segment, which is, obviously, a growing segment in the urban market. I was wondering if you can maybe give us some color around to what extent is that sort of contributing to the improvement in your broadband subs? And whether you believe we are seeing the full benefits of that shift yet?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [21]

Yes. Thanks, Phillip. It's super early days. And I love the work that everybody on the Consumer team has been doing at Shaw. And for the first 6 months of the year, lots of it was internal, it was channel management, getting our clean structure in place, it's really focusing on our investments, it's on every single day focusing on monthly recurring revenue and churn and growing Internet customers. I think, as you see with the launch of BlueCurve that, that approach becomes quite externally focused. To be clear, our whole approaches in the market is to compete aggressively to be our customers' Internet provider, overwhelmingly, on a 2-year value plan, and then to come up the stack in terms of selling them more services, which absolutely includes video on a home phone, but also includes wall-to-wall Wi-Fi, BlueCurve Home app, cloud-based DBR and all of the new services that are coming on the road map. So totally early days, very happy with the results so far

Operator   [22]

Our next question comes from Maher Yaghi of Desjardins

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [23]

I wanted to ask you, Trevor, on the VDP savings, you had approximately $27 million from what I see in your results in Q2, yet your operating income before amortization was up $32 million. So I'm just trying to figure out your comment about the second half about how much of the decline and growth are we to expect? Because from what I can see is that you are running ahead of those savings in terms of growth. So you're starting base is actually positive year-on-year, even before those savings from the VDP. So are you saying that you're going to invest more than $30 million, let's say, in all these initiatives that you're talking about marketing and IT investments?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [24]

Yes, thanks, Maher. I mean, considering the performance to date and plans for the second half of the year, we are very comfortable just confirming the delivery of the $140 million of VDP-related savings during the year. And I think we might be running slightly ahead of our plan with respect to OpEx savings and higher -- being a bit higher but CapEx savings being a bit behind compared to original guidance or plan of $85 million in OpEx and $55 million in CapEx. And just due to a variety of factors, such as in self-installed that, frankly, are a little bit better than expected. And while we're not ready to adjust any of the plans as Q3 is our highest number of employee exits. And we are expected to have accelerated investments in Q3 and Q4 of roughly $15 million, the investments that we did in the first half of the year were in the single digits. So it was fairly light. But if we continue to track ahead of this plan in terms of the upcoming quarter, we will provide an updated on the expected savings breakdown between OpEx and CapEx, if warranted in the F '19 guidance. We are expecting to spend some additional spend in Q3 and Q4 definitely related to marketing with some of the campaigns that were launched last week by Paul on the wireline side and also last week by Jay on the wireline sort of part of the poll at the wireless side. So we generally feel really comfortable again at that topper end of the guidance range of 6%. So there are going to be some other investments. And you can see from Q2 results, it was really driven off of VDP savings. And clearly, in Q3 and Q4, we started to realize VDP savings last year of roughly $16 million in Q3 and $23 million in Q4. So we are lapping some tougher comps. And again, it's really difficult to sort of forecast wireless EBITDA growth just because it really depends on volume and the volatility of the volume loaded

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [25]

Okay. And then going to wireless side. You guys talked a little bit about your strategy here, but can I talk -- ask you a question about your 5G plans? I mean, a lot of -- some of your peers have started talking about some of the timing of launch of 5G sometime late 2020, early 2021. Can you talk a little bit about how you're going into this upgrade cycle? What's the strategy? Some of the early signs of how much could it cost? I mean, I know you can't quantitate -- give a quantitative answer to this but just maybe, just talk a bit about capital -- I mean, wireless capital intensity as we go into 2020 and 2021?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [26]

Yes, Maher, it's Paul. So we're not going to give too much on kind of 5G going forward. I think our capital intensity, we've already indicated, is going to remain around the $400 million spend for both this year and next. And no change in guidance on that at this point. Look, we're very excited about the prospects for 5G. It's going to be driven mostly by device availability, which I think you're aware is sort of pushing out a little bit more by the day. We are excited for the prospects on that and, of course, the opportunity to bring a new and differentiated service to the market. At this point, though, I think it's a little speculative for all of us to talk about how this is going to come to market. So we'll give you maybe a little more color on the next call

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [27]

A bit early. Okay. And one last question on IFRS 16. Again, I'll go back to Trevor. All your peers now, except Cogeco, are running on IFRS 16 for their 2019 fiscal years. You're still using the old methodology. It puts you a little bit at a disadvantage, I would guess. Can you quantify what would -- if you have an early estimate of what your EBITDA impact could be under IFRS 16, that would be helpful?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [28]

Yes, thanks, Maher. Clearly, our peers have all reported the impact of IFRS 16 on their F '18 results. Due to different year-end, we're not required to report until Q1 F '20, and of course, our F '19 annual report, we'll have the required disclosure. We're well down the path in terms of implementation for the new policy, but frankly, at this stage, Maher, it would be premature to provide any estimates. But as we go through the work that we need to do behind the scenes, we'll provide the appropriate update at the appropriate time. But nothing for right now

Our next question comes from David McFadgen of Cormark Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David John McFadgen,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Director of Institutional Equity Research   [30]

I have two questions. Just on the wireless ABPU, ARPU, I was wondering if you could comment on what were the factors that cause it to decline from, say, Q1 '19 to Q2 '19? And then the other question is just on the 700 megahertz, you talked about going into fiscal 2020 to have it deployed, but do you think it's possible that it could be all lit up by the end of calendar 2019?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [31]

David, it's Paul. On ARPU and ABPU, the 2 primary drivers of the discounts are the subsidy amortization effect and in last quarter, the discounts we put in place in order to provide ourselves a little more of a price space versus the incumbents. On 700, do you want to..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [32]

Yes, David, just on that, I mean, I think we talked about it last quarter, we're going as fast and as efficiently as we can. We're really happy with how many sites we've lit up. It will spill over into F '20, though. And I think your assumption, that will be done by the end of calendar '19, is probably a bit premature. It will probably spill into -- the majority into F '20 -- or pardon me, throughout F '20 as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [33]

David, it's Paul. One other dynamic on that. We are seeing a notable improvement in the calls related to network performance in those markets where we have 700 already performing. So there has been -- clearly pronounced an immediate effect of that, which we're grateful for

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David John McFadgen,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Director of Institutional Equity Research   [34]

So maybe just a follow-up on that. How would you compare your network performance versus the incumbents in the areas that you have lit up the 700?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [35]

Obviously, much better with 700 lit up. We continue to look for ways to optimize the performance there, but I think every passing day gets us closer and closer to the level of quality that the incumbents are seeing

Our next question comes from Adam Ilkowitz of Citi

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adam Todd Ilkowitz,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Associate   [37]

Two, if I could. The network expansion and the 700 megahertz roll out that you're doing, can you just describe the type of equipment that you are installing, is it 5G ready? And is it capable of handling additional frequencies, such as those that may be coming up for auction or are available for auction? And then the second question I have is, can you talk about the productivity of the newer distribution points that you've been adding over the past 12 months? Notably, the third-party ones, are they -- do you think that they are selling your "fair share" within those channels or do you see more room for improvement?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [38]

Thanks, Adam. And answer to your first question is yes and yes, so they are compatible and we are 5G ready on those including in the core. On the second aspect, we are seeing on our new redistribution points, they are always going to be less efficient because they are not specials, right? So our primary distribution for the first number of years of our existence was in owned stores and in dealers control viewers. As we move into areas like The Mobile Shop and Walmart and Mobilinq, I think we're getting our fair share, but as we add those store doors, they are by definition kind of less efficient for us than something like a corporate store. So these are good fill in often times for geography, where maybe a smaller town that has perhaps a Walmart and a Mobile Shop but doesn't have a mall that would support a corporate store. So I think we're always going to seem to be a little less efficient than our kind of incumbent distribution. But we're very happy to have them in the mix and we think they bring a lot to the equation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adam Todd Ilkowitz,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Associate   [39]

Sure. Maybe just one question on the wireline side. With the introduction of BlueCurve, there are a few branding names from Shaw in the market WideOpen, FreeRange, can you just talk through how you're presenting all these things to the customer? And where you think this is going to make sure you have a clear message?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [40]

Yes, I think if you think about where we're headed, there is, for sure, where we keep active products in the market. We have moved away from individual product naming to a much clearer broadband experience naming architecture, so our next set of services in the market is certainly Shaw BlueCurve Home, BlueCurve Pods, you'll ultimately be seeing BlueCurve Video as we roll to IP. You can well imagine just by following the Comcast road map, what interest Comcast fascinates us, you can imagine what products are coming forward from us in the future and those will be under the BlueCurve banner as we really compete to be the customers' Internet provider and then come up the stack and sell them the whole range of services

Our next question comes from Drew McReynolds of RBC Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst   [42]

Just two follow-ups from me. First, on BNS or business services within wireline, obviously, a pretty good growth driver there. Jay, just can you comment on any headwinds or even almost a tailwind because you're the price disruptor, presumably, in that market from the Alberta economy and just overall how that business is tracking? And then secondly, just if we could get a little bit of an update in terms of your views on the CRTC wireless review and clearly the consultation with language on MVNOs, does that, to any extent, push back or change your wireless investment curve in the near term?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [43]

Great, Drew, it's Jay, I'll start on the business question as you suggest. And we're quite excited about where we're headed in terms of our business wireline business. Again, as we think about the wireline business, we think about 5% to 7% revenue growth in business. And all of that leading to 1% overall wireline revenue growth. And I think you've started to see the potential power in EBITDA of what's possible about that sort of focus on wireline. In terms of the Alberta economy, I think you've accurately reflected it. Our annual growth rate in Alberta year-over-year is slightly higher than the rest of our business footprint. So we get maybe some benefits. I mean, I think if you go back to the original plan 6 or 7 years ago, in a different economic environment with our Envision fiber assets in Calgary, we would've expected Calgary to drive our growth. So Alberta is neither pulling us down in business nor is it may be the engine that we won so far. We've got super exciting things happening in business, we've got SD-WAN, which really is focused on connecting our multi-location businesses together, we've got Ethernet over DOCSIS, we've got new SIP integration with SmartVoice, SmartWiFi, Smart Surveillance are all coming along, look, for that 5% to 7% growth rate. You see some noise in the RGUs in business, which is largely a culture of a work camp, some of which was in Q2, a little more of that same camp in Q3. We've got a competitive win, again, some of it in Q2 and then in Q3. And RGUs are probably less of a predictor in business because of the way we count modems and stuff, excited about the business going forward, and again, think about that 5% to 7% annual growth rate, but I think a 1% overall wireline revenue growth

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [44]

Drew, this is Brad here. Just to comment on the mandated MVNO. Like others in the industry, we were very surprised, if not shocked, to see the CRTC come out with their preliminary view in support of mandated MVNO. Clearly, we are absolutely opposed to this view, and we'll be participating in a comment period as to why the mandated regime is not only bad for Canadians but also bad for the future of sustainable wireless competition in Canada and the future of 5G in Canada. We think we are absolutely doing our part being more -- bringing more affordable services to Canadians. And listen, this is something we're going to go through, there's going to be many stages over the course of the year and even in the election. But again, we're going to be an active participant but it's really hard for me to comment right now on how these changes are going to make it -- affect our decision-making but I can just tell you, we're going to be very active and a full participant in that process

Operator   [45]

Our next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David William Barden,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD   [46]

I wanted to maybe ask a little bit about the consumer broadband business. Obviously, we had the 2x lift and speed in the quarter, so I guess there would have been 3 effects. One would have been the potential up-sell from the Internet 100 plan up to the 300 and 600 from an ARPU perspective, a churn benefit and then potentially a gross add benefit. So I was wondering if you could kind of maybe map out how those things kind of unfolded in the quarter? And how we could think about them sustaining into the forward quarters? And then depending on the answer to that question, could we expect a miniature version of that to follow in the business side of the house, now that we've kind of doubled speeds there?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [47]

Yes, I think that's an insightful question. We've got some win at our back in the Internet business. Our gross adds are up on a year-over-year basis, and this is even higher to -- prior to BlueCurve and really animating the market. When we talk about our approach to profitability in the Consumer business being monthly recurring revenue and managing that every single day when you open up the shop in the morning and you close it at the end of the night, you have an extra dollar in monthly recurring revenue that's our goal, dramatically lowering churn and growing Internet customers. On the churn side, we know on the Internet that our ValuePlan customers -- 2-year ValuePlan customers have 60% lower churn than our month-to-month customers and over the life of the customer that's 45%. Notably, in September, 43% of our Internet gross adds were on ValuePlan, and in February, that moved to 78% of our gross adds. So you can just play those churn characteristics, really more starting in August and flowing through Q1 and Q2 and you'll see what's happening there. I think, also, if you look at our pricing that we launched April 4, it's all about base management and you can see the opportunity to move from our a month-to-month Internet 100 pricing, up $3, $5, $7 and move all the way up to Internet 600 in a ValuePlan with the XB6, with the BlueCurve Gateway and BlueCurve Home and that whole experience. So you can see the monthly recurring revenue focus on Internet in that pricing. And so every conversation is about just moving that customer up. So I think you'll see all of those things coming together and you'll see churn improvements also happening as we unfold. So we're pretty excited about the trajectory of our consumer business generally and Internet and broadband in particular

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David William Barden,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD   [48]

And then do you see that flowing through into the business side, now that you've kind of taken the same approach there?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [49]

Yes, we think that's right. We're excited about the business side of the business and we were a bit more involved with some of the Meraki platforms in the SmartWiFi services that exist. The leadership of Katherine Emberly and the team there are doing a terrific job on base management and are probably a quarter or 2 later in terms of some of those moves because of the speed changes and those things. But that will be a big part of moving business to the high end of that range

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Vince Valentini of TD Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [2]

Let me start with the guidance and just make sure we're all on the same page, Trevor. So if -- correct me if I am doing my math wrong, but to do 6% without the $15 million IP item this quarter, you need to do about minus 3% EBITDA year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Is there anything else in terms of a onetime in nature that we may have missed from last year or that you expect this year that drives that number to be sort of negative? Or is that just the pacing of the sort of transition cost to VDP that you've been sort of telegraphing?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [3]

Yes. Sure, Vince. Thanks for the question. I think we've been very transparent with the street that we as a management team are very focused on delivering stable and consistent results and we are refining that we're at the top end of our guidance which has been consistent since October when we first released our original guidance. We're delivering VDP net operating savings specific to the program. However, we've got some additional cost -- OpEx in the business as we progress through the year related to higher syndication cost with higher marketing. We've got some higher reinvestments in Q4. I think, the street really needs to look at their Q4 wireline EBITDAs specifically and sort of look at more of considering the run rate over the last 3 quarters as opposed to the Q4 F '18 results. I'll just remind you from a revenue perspective in Q4 F '18, if you recall, we had a full quarter benefit of rate adjustments in the quarter, which was about $20 million. Whereas this year, we did have a rate adjustment during the year in April of this year, for 2 months in Q3. However, the rate adjustment wasn't as significant and I would say that there is a lot more proportion of our customers on contracts. So this annual rate adjustment is having its bit of effect as it previously did. So -- I think, factoring, I think your math is fairly accurate, Vince. But hopefully that gives you enough color in terms of the way that we are thinking about the business quarter-over-quarter. And not necessarily, I think the street maybe was making some assumptions on the Q4 F '18 run rate, which was $516 million of EBITDA last year and it's going to be tough. We do expect negative growth rate off of that number

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [4]

And one more, maybe for Jay. The shift going on in the wireline business. So the subscriber numbers, other than Internet, I mean if you look at video and phone and the satellite were all down somewhat materially versus Q3 last year. But the revenue growth ticked up, total wireline revenue growth up to 1% year-over-year growth, a little better than sort of 0.5% growth you've been doing in the first 2 quarters of the year. So the strategy seems to be working, but can you give us any more data points and color on what you're seeing? I mean, obviously, the customers you keep seem to have higher ARPU than the customers you're losing. But maybe you can talk about more detail on how you're managing through that process

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [5]

Yes. Sure. Thank you for the question, Vince. And we're pleased with our wireline subscriber results in Q3. The 6,600 Internet gains a nice step forward and everyone recognizes the usual student disconnects we saw in this quarter, and they were around normal level. The plan is working. Our focus on video profitability is delivering exactly what we wanted to deliver. Video churn has improved year-over-year. And so what you're seeing in numbers alters us being very segmented in terms of adding high-quality video subs. To be fair, in terms of subscriber numbers the one that was a little disappointing for us was the phone number for the quarter and, quite frankly, we would have a little pick up on churn in phone which is not something that we've seen in previous quarters and not something that we've seen in June, and so we'll put a little bit more focus into that area. But very happy with where the rest of the numbers are. Internet revenue growth continues to be strong, up 6% year-over-year in Q3. And the mix that we're seeing in the business we like a lot. You'll recall this year, we tried to build strategies on strategy, when it drives your behavior. We tried to focus the business entirely on monthly recurring revenue churn and growing Internet customers. And so it really is account level MRR and profitability that's driving the consumer activity. I think as you get into F '20, you'll see subscriber numbers and some of the other categories rebound a little bit just from the natural adjustment that we've gone through our strategy. But we're excited with where our monthly recurring revenue is headed and like where the consumer wireline business is going

Our next question comes from Drew McReynolds of RBC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst   [7]

Maybe I'll shift to you, Paul, on wireless. Obviously, Brad, in your opening comments, you addressed some of this. I think the big question here is just -- I guess, the playbook from incumbents probably wanting to push you back down market perhaps in response to the success you're having. Maybe just comment to your value proposition in the marketplace now versus 3 weeks ago to the extent you can. And the extent to which you're comfortable with the amount of "oxygen" that you have, in order to achieve your wireless growth objective. So, obviously, a big picture question. And then maybe, the opposite, for you, Trevor. Just can you comment on the cash tax situation for Shaw just as we look at over the next couple of years?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [8]

Drew, it's Paul. I think Brad's comments off the top are worth reiterating on a couple of fronts. And maybe first and foremost, it's nice to take a moment and probably acknowledge the sort of indisputable impact that we're having on wireless affordability in this country. It wasn't clear before, it certainly is clear now. So it's nice to see the incumbents coming down and sort of chasing us in that regard

So we've had a couple of years of continued market share gains, and that's really driven off the back to providing Canadian consumers with the value that they have been looking for. In the last few weeks, we watched the incumbents kind of cobble together these expenses, and frankly, fairly poorly architected imitations of our now 2-year old Big Gig plans. So it's nice to see them kind of having showing up

And to a certain length, it kind of appears that every new initiative of the big 3 is designed to just charge customers more. Honestly, sort of like the incumbencies where pricing innovation goes to die these days. We still have millions of Canadians that are going to be attracted to our value proposition because millions of Canadians are still getting charged excess overage fees up to $100 a gig. And there is still a $1 billion-plus in toxic revenue floating around impacting Canadians' everyday lives

So we look at these new unlimited plans from the incumbents. They really require the vast, vast majority of the customers to spend more than they were spending previously in order to make sure that they don't get the certain -- they have the certainty of no punishing fees. Frankly, it's kind of off-footing and Freedom has long been providing a better alternative. We'll continue to do that. We are very confident in our current run rate. As Brad said, we've seen no meaningful impact to our growth. So the oxygen that you referred to is more than adequate for us to continue to achieve our growth objectives, and we are very confident in our position

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [9]

Sure. And on the tax question, Drew, I appreciate it. Clearly, there were a number of tax items in this quarter related to a few events that impact both the cash tax and also net income. Effective tax rate, first of all, during the third quarter, we did take -- realized a free cash flow benefit of approximately $20 million related to the resolution of a matter with the CRA regarding the timing of certain tax deductions we took in prior years. And when that matter with the CRA was resolved, we reclassified $20 million of tax expense from current to deferred. In net income, excuse me, this quarter, we did recognize roughly $100 million decrease in our deferred tax liability due to the recent reduction in Alberta tax rates from 12% to 8% being phased in over 3 years. Frankly, Drew, the impact on our F '19 current taxes is nominal as the first reduction is effective July 1. And then finally, just to be complete, there was a significant item impacting net income this quarter is the loss related to the Corus sale. However, I would say that, that was roughly $100 million and that's the capital loss. No impact on free cash flow. Just to help you out from a modeling purpose, Drew, I think, we're expecting cash taxes with all the movements this year to be around $165 million in and around that snack bracket. And then going forward, I think if you wanted to use an effective tax rate of about 26% from a cash tax perspective is probably the right number. So hopefully that helps you

Our next question comes from Jeff Fan of Scotiabank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director of Telecommunication Services &amp; Canadian &amp; U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [11]

Maybe just to follow up on wireless. So questions for Paul to start off with. The ARPU or ABPU growth, ARPU, I guess, more specifically, decelerated a little bit this quarter. Wondering how you see that growth going forward. And what do you think you need -- you guys need to do? Or what the industry -- would you need to see from the industry to see that growth reaccelerate? And then the question on the IP licensing of $15 million. Can you give us a little bit more color on what this was related to within cable? Was this related to anything to do with the X1 video platform? Or was it something else? Is this truly onetime or there could be more related? So just wanted to get a little bit more color there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [12]

Jeff, it's Paul. ARPU and ABPU, we still like our ABPU growth story. I know these are in metrics this quarter. Probably we're a little bit behind what consensus was. Bear in mind that this was a quarter in which we did see the need to discount some of our incoming class of subscribers because of a fairly hot competitive environment. I'm still confident that there is a great story on ARPU growth over the course of the next number of quarters. In terms of accelerating it, some of what we've seen from the incumbents in the recent weeks, may create an opportunity. They're presuming in their math that they're going to be able to take customers up closer to that $75 price point. So as we formulate our response over the coming weeks, there may be some opportunity for us to similarly pick up some of that momentum. But we still like our story there. It's a positive one. We still got market-leading growth on ABPU. So I'd say, continue to watch this space as we formulate our response

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [13]

Awesome. And Jeff, it's Jay. On the IP licensing deal. I think, you can appreciate in our disclosure that these kinds of deals are complex and have confidentiality elements to it. And I'm sure you can understand the nature of it. To your specific question, this is not a commercial transaction with one of the partner-led strategic partners that we've identified in the past. So it's not related to a transaction with Comcast or with Meraki or with Nokia. It's a IP licensing deal. And you can see our disclosure on it, and we've got covered, so we're pleased with this. This was my deal. We concluded this deal. We're happy with the outcome. We're happy with what it sets forward for the future. And can't really disclose much more than that just because of the nature of the transaction. But it's not related to any of our ongoing partner-led strategic main partners that we've talked about in the past

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [14]

Our next question comes from Maher Yaghi of Desjardins

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [15]

I wanted to maybe just get your views on how you see margins behaving going forward after the -- most of the VDP savings are behind you now? Beyond, let's say, Q4, now we have a pretty good idea where you are sitting. But are there additional margin areas you can work on and to get some lift in your business, either wireless or wireline? And as you rollout -- continue to rollout wireless into 2020, can you talk a little bit about your CapEx plans, in general? Without -- no need to put out a number if you don't have to, but just trying to figure out your views on 5G deployment and your spectrum position for that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [16]

Sure. Thanks for the questions. It's Trevor. Maybe I'll start. There's a lot there. In terms of the wireline margin question, maybe we'll breakup the margin question into wireline and wireless. From a wireline perspective, listen, we're really happy with the performance of the business. You can see we're delivering roughly $95 million of VDP savings. We're still on track. Like we always said about $215 million of total VDP savings, we only have $20 million and that's sort of 50-50 split between OpEx and CapEx. So maybe it's a little higher 60-40, we'll update that, but it's in that snack bracket. We've got some other top opportunities on the cost side of things. We talked about the rollout of IPTV, just beginning here in May in Calgary in Brad's remarks. We're rolling out that service throughout the majority of our footprint by the end of this year. We think that obviously supports a very robust self-install experience so there's some cost from that perspective. We're focused on digital, which again limits -- lowers call volumes into our call centers. There's other costs here that we think that there is some opportunities to get some more efficiencies. However, that being said, there's also some other costs within the business that are going up as our partnership, as Jay mentioned with some of our key suppliers like Comcast and others, as we were successful, we're rolling out BlueCurve. There is obviously an element of variable cost with the success there. So we continue to see the margin within the wireline business, continue to see some opportunity, but clearly, there's been substantial growth this year from previous years, and that was probably the easy work behind this. We've got some chopping to do, but we're exciting about what we can do

On the wireless side, I would say, this quarter, I think, it was about 22% margin. And I think, Paul on the last quarter talked a little bit about where that -- we're clearly generating a little bit more margin from the scale of the operations, and we continue to expect that. But I think you're going to see a gradual increase in margins over the F '20. We don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but it's probably continued margin expansion from here, but not in a significant material manner. And then on your wireless CapEx question, I think, that was the last one?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [17]

CapEx going forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [18]

Yes. Listen, I think, we've -- the last couple of years, or this year, we've talked about around $400 million of CapEx. We continue to think that, that's the bulk of the approximate number in F '20. We'll crisp that up obviously in October, but we don't see significant increases to the overall amount of wireless capital over the coming years to live into a world of improved LTE service and foundation for 5G as well

Our next question comes from Sid Dilawari of Cormark Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Siddhant Dilawari,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Associate of Institutional Equity Research   [20]

I think at this point most of the questions have already been addressed. But just a quick one on wireless for Paul. I think this was the second quarter of decline in equipment revenue. How do you see that impacting the ABPU going forward? And then -- overall, like, how do you see this impacting the wireless business overall margin? I think for margins, it should be positive given that you already has -- do have better margins. So just maybe a question on future commentary on that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [21]

Yes. Thank you. You're spot on. We have seen some of the reflection that kind of moderating of ARPU and ABPU is related to some inbound success on prepay, but the larger driver of it is a fairly significant pick-up in BYOD as a percentage of our overall volume in the last couple of quarters. That is very much accretive to margins, so we're pleased with that. We also love that as it sets up as we move into the autumn, where the initial cohort of iPhone 8 and iPhone X subscribers on competitive networks start to roll off their 2-year financing plans. So we really like what that's doing for us. So you're absolutely right to pick that up. That does, of course, sort of have a negative impact on equipment revenue, but given that that's a generally a note of negative margin aligned for us anyway that's something we're not overly concerned about. So we like where that's heading, and we'll continue to press on that opportunity as it presents itself

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Siddhant Dilawari,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Associate of Institutional Equity Research   [22]

Okay. And then just another quick one on 5G rollout. Is there any plans on acquiring high-band spectrum or we're going to be where we are with the low-band acquisition you've made recently?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [23]

I'm sorry. You just left on the -- acquire what spectrum?

Siddhant Dilawari,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Associate of Institutional Equity Research   [24]

High-band spectrum. Yes, sorry

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [25]

Yes. We're just following the road map that [ICT] and the CRTC are putting into place for the spectrum auctions, and we're not committing further beyond the 3.5

Operator   [26]

(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Adam Ilkowitz of Citi

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adam Todd Ilkowitz,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Associate   [27]

I wanted to dig into free cash flow for a moment. The $176 million in the quarter and the raised guidance for the year. There seemed to a pretty big property sale during the quarter which helped the quarter as well as the $20 million tax item that you had mentioned in the Q&amp;A. Can you talk -- just kind of explain to us how investors should think about the -- about $550 million? And how it is impacted by any onetime or something not be recurring?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [28]

Yes. On the tax piece of it, we did, I think, I answered it earlier. We did realize about $20 million related to a resolution of a matter with the CRA. However, I would say that we have previously incurred higher cash taxes due to that. So I think it's sort of a true up in timing and we wouldn't call that onetime. I would say it's more about timing. On the sale of the building, I guess, that -- it netted off. It's within our overall capital budget, which still remains at $1.2 billion. So I wouldn't say that we were trying to treat the sale of the building that impacts free cash flow. And again, I know it's a little messy on the cash taxes. It looks a little light this year, and it's because of that $20 million

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adam Todd Ilkowitz,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Associate   [29]

I guess, the sale of the building during the quarter, was that included in your previous $500 million free cash flow guidance?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [30]

No. It was never part of free cash flow

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adam Todd Ilkowitz,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Senior Associate   [31]

Okay. I can probably take that off-line. And then my second question is on the wireline side. I'm kind of intrigued as to the margins, which have been roughly stable. With the amount of people coming off from the VDP program, can you guys talk about the size that what may be causing margins to be perhaps negatively impacted that would leave them flat rather than seeing an upward trajectory to margins?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [32]

Yes. We've talked about it a little bit out and we have -- we do have some other costs within the business that ticked up. And they're not just cost related to the VDP enablement program. There is regular merit increases in the business for the employees. There is the syndication costs that are becoming a more important line item or a bigger line item within the business considering our partner-led solution. So there's a few other costs that have increased obviously to offset some of the VDP savings. But clearly, I mean, we're very happy with the way the VDP program is going, and we're realizing the savings. The headcount is staying out of the business. But there is just some other costs within that have ticked up just a little bit, network, programming costs, things like that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [33]

And you can see all that in the (inaudible), Adam. We are quite confident at the direction of wireline profitability in our strategy. We're quite confident in the free cash flow profile of our company and where we're headed in subsequent years. The work that the team has done on VDP and the entire transformation has been extraordinary. We -- this quarter alone we have truck rolls down 30% year-over-year, this is the good start to a modern Shaw. All of our fundamentals are in place. And while -- I mean, coaches take losses and teams take wins. VDP and the work to transform our wireline business is working and the team is doing extraordinary. So we're excited about the future. So I understand the math you are doing. The free cash flow characteristics and the characteristics that the wireline business going forward, it's something we're very excited about

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Vince Valentini of TD Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [2]

First off, can you just clarify, Trevor, the $10 million charge for the CRTC decision, that should be a hit to revenue, I believe, in your Consumer division? Or did you just book it as an expense?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [3]

No, it's an impact to revenue as well. It's actually split between Consumer and Business a bit. And just to be clear, Vince, it's about $6.5 million or so on revenue. In EBITDA, there was also another regulatory provision that we took as well to aggregate to $10 million. But it does impact revenue as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [4]

On the free cash flow, guys, congrats, $700 million is a great target to go for. Can you just clarify a couple of things for us, so you'll save about $70 million in interest costs from that bond you just paid off with cash. Did your guidance embed that you will refinance with some longer-term debt and incur other interest costs to replace some of that $70 million? Or is it full $70 million you expected to flow through?
 Second, can you just level set us on restructuring costs and contract assets? Is there anything that we should expect to be materially different in those 2 lines in 2020 versus 2019?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [5]

Yes. Vince, I'm not sure if it's the full $70 million. We do expect some financing in here, so I don't -- there's not a $70 million decline in interest to get that's driving the free cash flow growth. I think the driver of the free cash flow growth really is EBITDA growth of 4% to 5%, which is roughly $85 million to $110 million, and then of course, on capital. And the capital moderation, frankly, is about $100 million lower than reported F '19 results. That moderation is sort of split equally between Wireline and Wireless. On the Wireline side, some VDP-related savings and efficiency there. And our partnership with Comcast, I think, historically, maybe we haven't articulated the strategy well as we could have, but there's been some OpEx trade-off for significant CapEx efficiency through the technology road map and partnership that we've embarked on with Comcast and other global scale providers. Self-install is really working for us. It's about 45%, as Brad mentioned in his remarks, and we continue to see it accelerate. So there's real Wireline moderation

On the Wireless side, Brad mentioned in his opening remarks, it was a busy year on the Wireless side of things, expansion into 19 new communities, expansion into retail -- significant retail and that's sort of behind us. We're going to continue to plow through the $700 million where about 70% in Western Canada that will be done by the end of calendar year. And then in the East, it will be substantially complete or fundamentally complete by the end of F '20 as well

So there really is a moderation of capital, like Brad said. Maybe some of the capital within Wireless is a little bit -- holding a bit back considering some of the regulatory uncertainty that's in the market right now. But the free cash flow profile we're very proud of, and we continue to see that strengthen going forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [6]

And if I could throw one in for Paul, I'm sure there'll be lots of questions on Wireless, but I just want to ask you how are you thinking about competitive intensity right now? It certainly seems from the Rogers results earlier this week that they're hurting a little bit. If you look at your blended sort of lifetime value of customers over the past 3 months, let's say, I mean, if you factor in the ARPU you're getting, the likely increase in equipment subsidies given the Absolute Zero program and then the superior volume of subs you're adding, are you happy with where all those vectors line up? Or do you think yourself and the industry could be doing a little bit better if somebody got more disciplined and others followed?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [7]

Well, it's hard not to argue with you -- or not to agree with the last point. So I think by any objective measures, it's fair to describe Q4 as one of the most competitively intense period the Canadian wireless industry has ever seen. You've got all of the incumbents launching unlimited, 2 of those guys being the largest media owners in the country. So we certainly saw some significant pressure over the course of the 90-day period. I would argue and I think you saw earlier this week that there is something on the lack of pricing discipline in the market really across-the-board. My perspective is unlimited below the rate that I probably should have done, and certainly, the results you saw here this week probably support that

So overall, just in broad summary of your question, we still love what we're getting here. Absolute Zero for us was an absolute home run. We've been able to move 30% of our postpaid adds to a rate plan of $75 and above. We're including moving into the neighborhood of the premium brands and we saw that in our quarterly numbers. It was certainly an expensive quarter from a subsidy standpoint. But what we got in exchange for that trade was something we would take again and we'll do again

So we like where we are. There's probably 10 to 15 basis points of churn that I would put in the seasonal category and attributable to that intensity, but we expect that to moderate over the course of the next year and still see the churn for us is somewhere in that range of 1.3% to 1.35% over the course of the next 12 months

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [8]

Our next question comes from Drew McReynolds of RBC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst   [9]

Starting with -- back to the Wireline side, maybe for you, Jay or Trevor. When you look at the trajectory of that business in fiscal 2020, obviously, a lot of recalibration and focus on base management over the past couple of years. Can you refresh us on what your assumptions are for the top line and the extent to which potentially you can get EBITDA margin improvement over the medium term?
 And then, secondly, a couple of housekeeping items. Just to confirm, Trevor, the growth guidance excluding IFRS 16 for fiscal 2020, that's off the $2.161 billion number? And then, secondly, just comment on the cash tax rate year-over-year, if there's any really major move there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [10]

Okay. So there's lots there, Drew. I'll take the easy ones first. Yes, it is off. Just to be clear, the growth guidance that we gave is off reported results. And cash taxes, we expected -- sort of the last couple of years, it's approximated at around $160 million, we expect that to be about the same for F '20 as well

Maybe I'll start then on the Wireline, the first question on Wireline trends. I think F '20 is really going to be a continuation of our overall strategy to deliver growth through Wireless, but then also Broadband business while managing through the VDP exits in F '20. On Wireline, in F '19, we certainly delivered improved Broadband growth of around 35,000 subscribers. We expect this trend to continue, offset by clients in some other categories, in more maturing products like TV and the Home Phone

Overall, Drew, on the top line, if you look at Consumer revenue, it has been decreasing over the last 7 years at a rate of about 50 basis points. And frankly, we expect that trend to continue and maybe modestly accelerate a little bit as we -- there's additional OTT competition with Disney coming into the fall, does that accelerate cord cutting or cord shaving a little bit. We're cautious on the Video business and then what it does from a revenue perspective

Traditional Home Phone is going to continue at its current pace of decline just due to Wireless substitution

And then on Internet revenue side, continued growth there. There's no doubt about it. But perhaps we're just going to really monitor the competitive dynamics that's happening out there specifically within the TPIA space as well considering a lot of the uncertainty there. That's all going to be offset by continued growth obviously in Business as well. We're targeting 5% again. And combining those two, really, F '20 looks a lot like F '19, which is sort of flat to maybe down a little bit on Consumer revenue is the way that we're running the business

And then from an EBITDA perspective, there's some VDP savings incremental $25 million of OpEx that we're going to deliver to the bottom line, but there are some incremental costs coming with our strategy, which is significant capital efficiencies. Again, just want to highlight the free cash flow and the simple free cash flow that's been generated out of the Wireline business it's very impressive. But from a margin perspective, we continue to see opportunities, but there is going to be some offsets through VDP, through higher syndication costs with our partners, some of the outsourcing costs as we move to the cloud

That being said, if you look at sort of reported EBITDA growth rates at 2.1% on Wireline, 3.3% for the year, adjusted when you take out some of those onetimes, we continue to see Wireline growth this year and maybe a bit of Wireline margin expansion, but we do think that it's fairly modest. And it really is about stability and profitability again of the Wireline business is really the focus. And hopefully, everyone saw last year quarter-over-quarter, it was sort of anywhere between $490 million and $500 million, it was, really, in a quarter very consistent, stable Wireline EBITDA results and that's what we're focused as a management team again to deliver this year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [11]

It's Jay, Drew, building on Trevor's remarks kind of qualitatively (inaudible) F '19 process about focus on (inaudible) recurring revenue, focus on churn, growing our customers every quarter and some part of the team that did all through the things we set out to do. I think as we stand on that foundation F '20, it's all about customer data segmentation and selling the right product to the right customer. Our systems, our teams have become so much more advanced in this area. And you can see it in our strategy and in our CapEx, and you can see it in everything we do. And really driving that in of pursuit of customer value in F '20 and tremendous opportunity there makes matters a lot. So more of the same base management focus that you talked about, and we're going to continue to work hard on that point

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [12]

Our next question comes from Jeff Fan of Scotiabank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director of Telecommunication Services &amp; Canadian &amp; U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [13]

Just a quick housekeeping before we getting to the questions. On the CRTC $10 million charge, the revenue impact sounded like it was 6.5. What was the split between Business and Consumers? Can you just help us with that because it looks like Business revenue..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [14]

It's above -- sorry, Jeff, it's about $2 million in Business and the rest in Consumer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director of Telecommunication Services &amp; Canadian &amp; U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [15]

$2 million?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [16]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director of Telecommunication Services &amp; Canadian &amp; U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [17]

Okay. Got it. And then my question is one for Paul on the Wireless side. I think given what we saw with some of the incumbents' move in the quarter, you guys did a great job in attacking the handset pricing and you continued to leverage subsidies to get your old customers in. Sounds like your quite happy with the results that you've got. And am I my right in reading that subsidies will continue to be an important part of your customer loading and retention?
 And then the second wireless question is around ARPU. 0.5% growth, that's great that it's still positive considering what we're seeing in the industry. But can you talk a little bit about the mix impact because of your strong prepaid and maybe even the loading in Absolute Zero and how subsidies may have impacted your service revenue? And how do we think about ARPU growth in 2020?
 And then my last question is for Trevor on the CapEx, $1.1 billion for next year. Do you think this is sustainable both on the Wireless and the Wireline side? Just want to make sure that this is not a one-year kind of dip before we go back up

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [18]

All right. Jeff, it's Paul. Thank you. I'll take the first couple. On your question about the subsidy in EIPs, we have a very different view of the EIPs than some of our peers. I think it's worth spending a minute on kind of highlighting these extensions. First, I think other operators have described EIPs like they sort of magically removed hundred of dollars of subsidy investment without any customer impact, and that's a remarkable oversimplification from our perspective. Simply put, EIPs, the way that they've been characterized in the Canadian market of late are really just a massive price increase wrapped up in a fancy financing bow. We, Canadians, are smart enough to do the math on that. It's painful. And when the incumbents launched their unlimited plans over the summer, they [collapsed] much of the rate plan number that we saw. But their ambition to coincidently introduce EIP is to pay for those rate reductions has clearly not come to fruition. You saw it [come to that] carrier earlier this week. And I want to be clear about our strategy on subsidy. We're going to continue to use the best pricing to distinguish Freedom from our competition and we don't take direction from the competition on phone pricing. So the promise of the $75 unlimited plan and the subsidy-free EIP isn't the one that we plan on adhering to. We (inaudible) make that promise, we're not going to keep it

Secondly, on point of ARPU, there's been a lot of interest and I understand that over the course of the last number of days. However, I want to be clear that for us, we continue to see ARPU as a growth metric in F '20. Our expectations are meet or exceed F '19 performance [of at least] 3.2%. This is, of course, subject to continued rational competitive activity

But we're confident in that outlook because we don't really share the same ARPU risk profile that some of our peers do and specifically in 2 key areas: one is we don't have the exposure of overage revenue to lose that you see in kind of glaring terms this week, how gravity ultimately affects talks of revenue. And then early in 2020, we finally begin to reap the ARPU-accretive impacts of the 2-year iPhone cohort rollout of the subsidy amortization schedule. So it means that our ARPU gains for this year are very much second half F '20 story, Jeff, but we feel confident we can deliver that one through the course of the year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [19]

And on the sustainability of the CapEx, Jeff, let me break into the 2 components. On Wireline, you saw we went from 24% CapEx intensity in F '18 to around 19% this year. And we continue to see that moderating, hence, sustainable moderation going forward. We don't see a step-down as much as we did obviously from F '18 to F '19, but we continue to see that more in that 18%

And some of the drivers there, Jeff, again is just our network is in fabulous shape to handle the loads in the traffic on our Wireline network. We've got IPTV now rolled out to 70% of our footprint, and that will continue throughout the year. There's significant capital savings related to that, not just on CPE, but more so, frankly, on our cost to serve and just our self-install. We weren't able to self-install the TV customer last year with the technology that we have out there. With IPTV, we can. And that's just, again, the benefit of -- the holistic benefit of the partnership with our technology providers being Comcast, so that's very sustainable

On the Wireless side, just in moderation this year as well. I think I talked about it with my previous response to Drew just on the overall free cash flow guidance. It's coming down a little bit this year. Some of that is because the activity we've done. Some of it is because we're a bit concerned with the regulatory environment. When Brad mentioned in his remarks we have some plans maybe on some corridors between some of the cities in light of some of the hearings kicking off in January, we just want to make sure that when we're spending capital within all of our businesses including Wireless, that we're going to get an appropriate return on that capital. So we have dialed that back a little bit and that's something that may, depending on the outcome and the environment, that may be something that there is some additional capital that goes into Wireless versus -- if we think about F '21 versus F '20 looking forward, but we don't see it being materially higher than probably the F '19 total capital that we spend of $385 million

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director of Telecommunication Services &amp; Canadian &amp; U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [20]

Great. If I could just ask one quick follow-up, Paul, on the ARPU. On the Absolute Zero customers that are coming in or migrating, what kind of ARPU are you getting, if you can share that?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [21]

Yes. I mean Absolute Zero is a little bit of a tricky way to keep track of because it has pretty significant accounting implications the way that we've got it structured, but the quick math on it, Jeff, is that just we bring those customers in on the $75 rate plan or above. Something around 40% of that gets booked in the month, so we hit consensus of EBITDA in the quarter, but that means we've done about 40% of the cost of that subsidy already in the books and behind us. Prospectively, it means that we'll then amortize the remaining 60-odd percent over the course of the next 24 months. So the ARPU coming in on those plans today is kind of in the high 40s. But important to remember that, that's over the first 24 months. When we roll into the 25th month and beyond for those subscribers, that ARPU reverts back to $75. So a lot of the benefit that we're seeing in our growth story really doesn't start to work into our math until a couple of years out. But we really like what we're getting on those subscribers, and that's the story we're going to continue to press into

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [22]

Our next question comes from Aravinda Galappatthige of Canaccord Genuity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Suranimala Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD   [23]

First question is on, obviously, your expansion on the Wireless side to a lot of the communities in the West, I think the total population is sort of close to 1.5 million. I wanted to get a sense of the different dynamics within those territories versus the areas you've been competing in. I mean would you characterize that as -- I know it's always competitive, but would you, relatively speaking, characterize that as more sort of a low-hanging fruit that could help sort of potentially ramp-up your net adds going forward?
 And then, secondly, with respect to the capital efficiencies that you talked about. Obviously, the 45% self-install numbers sort of jumps out as a key positive. I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on that. Are you talking about all installs whether it's Internet TV or on a bundled basis, 45% being self-installed? And the proportion of savings that actually emulating from that?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [24]

Yes. 45% is of our total number of installs, and it's a fantastic result ahead of our target. We had a terrific back-to-school period. We were busy with back-to-school this week -- this year. And I got a text every single day from our VP of Operations wondering when the installs are going to come through, and I've not seen that in 23 years of back-to-school here. Self-install changes and everything

I think if you look at our success in terms of truck rolls and operational savings, it's easy for you to figure out the math. Important to note with IPTV, there's no in-home wiring as well and so there's real simplicity that comes with getting rid -- not using the cable in your house the whole [plan to a spot]. The promise that we talked about through the transformation is absolutely being delivered. And we're going to build off 45% this year and look at a much bigger number for that in FY '20. So you're seeing that in the free cash flow characteristics of our company now

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [25]

Aravinda, it's Paul. On the first question regarding the new markets in the West, just 1 million of the 1.4 million subscribers we added this year in terms of coverage were in the West. Great work from the engineering network team to build that out in such rapid fashion. I don't know if I'd characterize it as low-hanging fruit. You've sort of got 2 dynamics occurring at the same time. There's certainly pent-up demand and a lot of customer anticipation as we go into those markets. So we're met with open arms and we see some good early volume there. But the other side of it is that those -- the network and the brand are new in those markets, so they are subject to probably to some bedding in and we have to build each of those out in a way that makes them familiar in those markets. So I think that's probably about to push over the course of the first year that they're in the market. We love growth in the West in Wireless because it ultimately set us up when we bring the 2 businesses closer together, Wireline and Wireless, we love the opportunity that those markets bring us. So I think that story gets written a little more over time, but we're still happy with the initial results in those new markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Suranimala Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD   [26]

And just a quick follow-up to that point. Are you still sort of in that, roughly speaking, 60-40 split with respect to east-west in terms of gross add?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [27]

So it's 70-30, Aravinda, which is in its historical level

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [28]

Our next question comes from Tim Casey of BMO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Equity Research Analyst   [29]

A couple for me. But Paul, just on the subsidies again. I clearly get where you're coming from, but one of the pushbacks or the thrust the other operators are making that with the high cost of handsets is the subsidy model is punitive over the long term. I'm just wondering how you think about balance sheet management in that as high-end handsets are obviously quite expensive?
 And just one spectrum question. Any chance you could talk about how your plans are coming to deploy the 600-megahertz spectrum?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [30]

Thanks, Tim. We've used subsidy not in isolation. So our perspective from reading from your customer [outwards] is more of total cost of ownership structure, so I understand the commentary around the price increases that we've seen in the market on devices, although that has moderated significantly with the launch of the iPhone 11 over in September. We've seen a pretty significant reduction in those entry-level prices, so there has been a bit of shift in the other direction

I'd perhaps provocatively argue that the significant decline we saw in the price of unlimited from the big 3 might have been prejudged to be perhaps a little too aggressive and a bit too early. That's going to be one of the things that factors into their overall cost of ownership as well. So we just don't look at devices in isolation

So from our perspective, we are very comfortable with the level of subsidy we're putting in the market. It has been coming down. It will continue to decline over the course of the year. And in the overall mix, we're happy with the blend that we're getting here. So I don't think there's much of a story there. EIPs that we discussed earlier on are not a magic cure to anything. It just all it has go into the math. And what we saw in August and continue to see is very strong consumer response. So we like our model and we're going to continue to press into it

On 600, I think it's early for that. As I think we mentioned on the last call, we'll continue to make sure that our infrastructure is ready for 600 when it gets unpacked from the broadcasters. So we'll be reporting more on that in subsequent calls as we get closer to the date

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [31]

Our next question comes from Maher Yaghi of Desjardin

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [32]

My first question is on the guidance. Looking at your 4% to 5% growth organic here, well, apples-to-apples, the range is quite tight, $20 million buffers on a total base of 2.2 approximately. What gives you this kind of level of granularity in terms of giving this outlook with such a small bracket?
 And I have a question on the initial cohort -- or I'll wait for your answer before I ask the question on..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [33]

Thanks, Maher. I mean, hopefully, you saw it last year, live within our commitments. Even last October when we came up 2019 guidance of 4% to 6%, there was a lot of questions about that and whether that range was too tight or too conservative. And clearly, we had some onetime impacts that impacted the guidance, but we really delivered it. The management team here is laser-focused on execution and running the business on a daily basis looking at key metrics and KPIs and feel very, very comfortable about the budgeting process and the planning process that we went through in excruciating detail this year

So you're right, it's a fairly narrow range when you look at a company of our size, but we're very comfortable with the range. And we're going to go and deliver this year just like we did last year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [34]

I'll pick up another way. It seems like you're so confident that you're giving this small range. So I'm trying to figure out what made you, let's say, not go to 6% if you had this kind of confidence in giving this range like not quite..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [35]

Yes. I think that's sort of the competitive environment. I mean we know where consensus estimates were at, they were above 5% where in the beginning they want consensus to stay where they're at. I think I walked through and articulated the realities of the Wireline business. But listen, we're very comfortable with the Wireline business and the free cash flow generation of the business. So I think -- I hope investors are really not just looking at EBITDA and EBITDA guidance range, but really focusing on free cash flow generation of the business

And yes, competitive dynamics in the Wireless business are intense. We just went through probably one of the more intense back-to-school periods, and so we do want to get over too much on Wireless as well whether it's growth in service revenue and flow through to EBITDA margins and margin expansion. So we're very comfortable, Maher, with the guidance range that we have out

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [36]

Okay. That gets me into free cash flow because I wanted to ask you a question on that, $700 million, and you said in your prepared remarks that you're embarking on a improving trend in free cash flow. And because of that, you started with NCIB and the DRIP change. What do we have -- if we look further out, what are the things that you like to see the company perform in terms of free cash flow growth rate beyond the $700 million in 2020? How should we look at 2021, 2022? Is that a continuous improvement in free cash flow that you're expecting longer term? Or is there something in 2020 with the CapEx being reduced like that, that is a onetime in nature?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [37]

No, I think I talked about it early on the Wireline capital side, again specifically with the strategy that we embarked on a number of years ago in the transformation. The CapEx savings are real, sustainable and we continue to focus on other efficiency opportunities in front of us well and a lot of those are on the capital side of things, so we feel very, very comfortable about the right level of investment in the Wireline business. And it's moderating, and we continue to see opportunities going forward. So we don't foresee any big CapEx spike

We did talk a little bit already about Wireless. Maybe we're holding a little bit back this year, but it's not that much. And we don't see any significant spikes in Wireless capital from, for example, the run rate that we delivered in F '19 of $385 million. So we continue to see EBITDA growth rates beyond F '20 and we continue to see all of that flowing to the bottom line in that combination of things that continue to generate strong free cash flow above our $700 million in future years

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [38]

Is it fair to say that you're holding back a little bit on Wireless because of what the upcoming hearing is going to bring out in terms of change or not in terms of policy in Canada?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [39]

Yes, a little bit. If i wasn't clear with my previous remarks, that's what we're trying to imply

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [40]

Okay. And my last question is on iPhone and I'm trying to figure out what you kind of implied in your guidance when it comes to the cohort of iPhone customers that you loaded closing in on 2 years now in end of November, early December? What kind of churn rate implied in that cohort versus the churn rate you're currently having in your base and the type of subsidy that you are implying to repaying those customers?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [41]

Thanks, Maher. It's Paul. I looked into the specific levels of that, but I will just give you a couple of guiding principles. First, anytime we have a customer in a 2-year device financing plan, we see a significant improvement in their churn profile, looking more in the sort of 1% range than in the 1.3% range. So when we report postpaid churn that, of course, includes BYOD, which has a higher churn profile. So you can always assume that we're looking up on people into a device financing plan because it has great characteristics on all fronts

When we launched the iPhone in December of 2017, of course, every month, we've been taking essentially another cohort of finance subscribers into our amortization schedule and have not had the benefit of customers rolling off that 24-month schedule. And if you just think about the life -- the average life of an iOS subscriber in Canada, it's 2.9 years according to Apple, which means that once they roll off the amortization schedule month 25 through, say, 35 -- 34, 35, they pop back up to their complete ARPU, so there's no longer an accounting impact to that

So it means that in December, January of this coming year, you'll start to see that first cohort roll off, that will be accretive to ARPU. It's not a big pop right out of the block because, of course, we're also adding people then behind it. But it means that our ARPU story starts to get incrementally better over the course of the last half of the year. And that's a benefit that we have that we're looking forward to. The other operators, of course, have already had that 24-month rule and we've still been filling up that bucket. So we have 3 or 4 more months left of filling it up and then we get to sort of start to take withdrawals from it, which is positive to our story

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [42]

Our next question comes from David McFadgen of Cormark Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David John McFadgen,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Director of Institutional Equity Research   [43]

Yes. A couple of questions. Maybe I'll start the first one on clarification. Just on the 700-megahertz spectrum, did you say that as far as Western Canada goes, you'll be deploying that in calendar 2020? But Eastern Canada, you'll be done fiscal 2020? Can you clarify that?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [44]

I told you David, with that, Paul, just correct me, we meant calendar 2020 it'll be done by in Western Canada. And substantially complete in Eastern Canada by the end of F '20

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David John McFadgen,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Director of Institutional Equity Research   [45]

Okay. Okay. So calendar 2020 first one, F 2020 after. So just a question on Wireless. Post -- now we're in the Q1, have you seen any impact on your loading from the incumbent's unlimited plans?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [46]

Thanks, David. It's Paul. Probably the most significant impact we saw would have been in the early days of it as you had kind of an initial rush in that, that certainly impacted us as I indicated from a churn basis 10 to 15 basis points. So we saw an initial bit of activity there. We continue to like what we see for loading, both the quality and quantity. We've been very clear in kind of telegraphing that we look to have a balanced scorecard the way we manage the Wireless business, which means we're looking to do something in the area of 250,000 net adds over the course of each year and continue to have a strong revenue and EBITDA growth story, and we continue to be tracking nicely on that front. So I think for all the energy and initiatives that we face from the victory, we weathered that storm brilliantly through the course of the summer and continue to do so now

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David John McFadgen,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Director of Institutional Equity Research   [47]

Okay. And then a question just on the Wireline side of the business. When you look at the Video, the cable video losses, they seem to just kind of be hanging in at this rate. Is there anything in your mind coming on the horizon that could actually potentially lower them?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [48]

Yes. This is Jay again. I mean, first of all, we were very pleased with our Internet loads and the right-on strategy for the quarter. We took a significant -- and we're very comfortable with what's happening in the satellite video space, and there's the natural seasonality, which you'll see in Q1. We've got ARPU of $84 in that right now and our business is very profitable, and that'll be a continuation of trend

But I think your question specifically about the broadband and cable video of significant loss 32,000 in the quarter and that really reflects when we launched our IPTV platform in 70% of our customers in the last 5 weeks of the quarter with some of them being launched with 2 weeks left in the quarter. So we're in a little bit of a technology change that we're holding our powder a little dry and also a little bit more focused on [student]. You probably have seen this week that we've launched our next-generation packaging called BlueCurve Total that really brings all of the advantages of the Comcast program, the very best of the Comcast road map to consumers. And so we're already seeing a significant uptake in that percentage of double-play installs this quarter as opposed to Q4. So we won't get ahead of ourselves. I mean the Video business is the Video business steady and we're steady as she goes in terms of how we're pursuing it. But we'd certainly be disappointed if we haven't another number like Q4 and Q1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [49]

Great. Thanks, everyone, and we're really looking forward to FY '20, and we'll see you at the next call or talk to you in the next call

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Vince Valentini of TD Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [2]

Can I ask 2 questions on Wireless and 2 on Cable? The Wireless first. You don't disclose COA, nobody does anymore, but can you directionally give us any sense as to how much may have increased in Q1 versus Q4 or Q3 given all the competitive offers out there and given your Absolute Zero plan? I'd just like to get some sort of handle on how much equipment subsidies and other promotional costs are going up

The second question would be, in December, you finally will be lapping 2 years of having the iPhone, which has lots of positives for ARPU in future quarters, but is there a negative in terms of churn? We already saw churn up in Q1. Is that going to be a little bit tougher when those contracts expire in December? Given all the offers from competitors, should we expect churn to go even higher than 1.5% for December and for all of Q2?
 And then the 2 Cable ones, I'll just throw out there, so Jay can think about them while Paul is answering. One is Home Phone. The decline here surprised me a little bit because it's already declined so much in recent years. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like about 17% penetration of your total households now is the number of people who -- on the Consumer side, who take Home Phone, and it's only like 39% of your broadband customers. Are we starting to reach a floor level here? Or do you expect Home Phone to continue to fall at this kind of pace?
 And then lastly just Business. Is 5% adjusted kind of what you expect now, obviously, adjusting for the data center divestiture? Or is 5% a bit on the low end of what your target range would be for future quarters?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [3]

Vince, it's Paul. Thanks for those 2 questions. I'll take them in order. On your first question about COA. Yes, there's short-term competitive dynamic that we've seen, which has relented a little bit in the last week or so but certainly was well in place through the course of the Black Friday through early January period, probably put about 10% to 15% on the cost of acquisition during that period. I just can -- I kind of classify that as a short-term inflationary dynamic that we expect to and hope to see move back to normalized levels over the course of the next few weeks

On the iPhone cohort. Yes, I mean, we're -- as Brad said, we're really, really pleased with how positively that initial class of iPhone customers have responded to our renewal efforts, which, of course, as you'd imagine, had been about 2 years in the making as we build up that team. The sheer scale and compressed timing of that renewal cohort was really unlike anything we've ever had to deal with before. So I want to -- just before I answer the question, I want to recognize the efforts of the fantastic work that the base management and the retail sales and our customer care teams have done in building the infrastructure and the capability to make sure that we're ready for success here

And I won't get too deep into the math on competitive -- for competitive reasons. But I will say that the cohort is largely tracking as expected. December, if you could dream, you certainly wouldn't graduate your first-ever iPhone cohort into the busiest competitive kind of quarter, really, that I can recall in the Canadian market. So we have seen, as Brad indicated, both increased gross adds as well as increased churn. And I would expect that as long as we're seeing the pressure that we're seeing in the marketplace today that the levels we saw in December will probably continue through January. A little bit early to call the Q2 number, but I would say it's probably in or around that range again

But I don't want to confuse the renewal of the iPhone cohort with just the general competitive dynamic. I'm more concerned about the overall intensity of the market right now and the value that's being put into that market. That and about the renewal, I think we've done just a great job on the renewal, and we've learned a lot. We've industrialized our behavior behind that, and this is something that we're good at now. It's really the overall market that's driving churn

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [4]

Great. Thanks. Vince, we'll keep going. Your question on Home Phone, we -- we're happy with where we are in our Home Phone business. I think as you look at the calendar year, you'll likely see maybe a slight decline in losses in Q2 and then a better result in Q3. The base is getting smaller. These are extremely high-value customers. One of the things you see in Q1 is our snowbird customers overwhelmingly skewed a Home Phone and come back up on in Q3. So there's -- just the base is small enough now, and it's enough within a sort of booming bundle segment that you see a slightly weaker result in Q1 than in subsequent quarters

I think to be clear, though, we're talking about very small changes, the trends that you're seeing are the trends in the business. Notably, as we continue to drive segment to the high-value subs, our BlueCurve Total package, which is a super-rich video package with Internet at $169, and you can add Home Phone for $10. A decent portion of our customers are adding Home Phone for $10, but the $10 and the $169 million is not really the strategic thing that we're driving after. So we're comfortable with where the business is, maybe just a slight improvement

On Business, I think in the medium term, we're right on top of 5%. I know there's a bunch of noise with stuff moving around and the sale of the data center and revenue comp. I think it's important to note the data center really wasn't -- doesn't have any impact on EBITDA comp so probably doesn't have as much impact as you might think. I think in the medium term, we're at the low end of what that possibility looks like. I think that when you think through what's happening in Business, we've got really stable SMB growth that we're very happy with, and it's offset against price competition. And we've got pockets where the economy is impacting our legacy service and large enterprise segments. So lots of moving pieces there. We think in the medium term, an opportunity to tip up above 5%, but I think 5% is kind of in the general range of what we're looking for, for the next couple of quarters

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [5]

So our next question comes from Jeff Fan of Scotiabank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director of Telecommunication Services &amp; Canadian &amp; U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [6]

I've got a couple on Wireless and a quick one, hopefully, for Cable as well. Just on Wireless, Paul. Can you maybe help us kind of dissect the specific competitive behaviors that were in the market during your quarter or through December that may have caused the higher gross adds and higher churn? I know Vince alluded to subsidies, but there was probably some on pricing as well, so maybe you can just help us dissect what was happening, and whether you've seen any kind of let up since the holiday period has ended into January

The second part on Wireless is just on your comment regarding the 2-year cohort that it's somewhat in line with your expectations. Wondering if you can give a little bit of color regarding maybe what those expectations are regarding those that would hang on to the device versus upgrading versus perhaps incumbent win-back activities. And then as we look out the rest of the year -- that's kind of the third question, whether you continue to believe that 2020 ARPU growth for this fiscal year will be greater than 2019

And then the question on Cable for Jay is, it sounds like the BlueCurve Total really had an impact on Video adds. I'm curious why Internet adds didn't quite see the same kind of lift as Video either sequentially or year-over-year. Maybe talk a little bit about the drivers that caused the Video adds to improve so much better than last year and last quarter?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [7]

Great. Jeff, thank you, it's Paul. I'll take the first 3 in quick order. On the competitive dynamic over the course of the last -- I'll kind of characterize it from Black Friday through to last week, I think many of you already noted that the incumbents haven't exactly been paragons of pricing discipline during this period. Really, since the launch of unlimited plans last summer, they've been fairly erratic. And that Black Friday through Christmas period was really no different than that

It's important to kind of observe here. We've seen a significant break with convention from the incumbents in the last sort of while. And in the last number of months, it's been them that kind of led the market down with pretty significant first mover and very expensive spending programs. And it's a long list

So you asked for some specifics. I'll just call out a few things that I think are notable. During this time, we've seen much larger handset subsidies. We've seen massively discounted second lines as low as sort of $50 for 10-gig for unlimited. Many of you will have seen over holidays some pretty expensive gift with purchase bonuses like Sonos speakers and Apple Watches and AirPods. Gift cards in national retail got up to as high as $400 for some relatively modest MRC plans. We saw a $400 airtime credits of, again, similarly kind of mid-market plans. On prepay, which is an area that we didn't spend a lot of energy on in the last quarter, primarily because we saw pretty significant promotions like first month free, we chose to pursue quality rather than quantity on that front

And the incumbents even did things operationally that I was, frankly, a little disappointed in like turning a blind eye to whether a customer was really a business or not and giving them sort of business pricing to consumer level subscribers. There were -- I guess, at the end, the thing that was maybe most compelling were the very, I'd call them, fairly desperate win-back programs that we saw with some really extraordinarily discounted offers over the course of the holiday period

You put all that into the kettle, and I think the sheer scale of that spending in recent months suggests that some of the calculus involved in moving to unlimited so aggressively might have been miscalculated, but it certainly wasn't, at least, mistimed. It is as competitively intense right now and has been for the last 2 months as I've ever seen it. And only really in the last week, Jeff, to the second part of your question, have we seen any relief at all. Some more discipline coming into the market, but I'd still characterize it as early

Throughout that, our strategy hasn't changed. We are continuing to balance growth and profitability. We're not moving off our expectations for this year in terms of 0.25 million net adds. And in response to the last part of your question, we do anticipate that our F '20 ARPU will exceed F '19 ARPU, and we're still confident on that front. So overall, we have a very confident view of this. We love where the market is. From our standpoint, certainly, it was a -- has been a sort of tricky 60, 90 days. It's inflated GAs, it's inflated churn, but we're still executing exactly as we hoped to

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [8]

Awesome. And Jeff, on your Cable BlueCurve question, just sort of level-setting because you probably don't see in Western Canada all of the marketing that exists. At its highest level, BlueCurve enables customer control of the modern smart home, and we're with our customers every step of the way as that smart home evolves. Great start and a bump in our brand after repositioning Shaw as a technology leader. So happy with where we are. What's driven in terms of Video losses is mitigation of BlueCurve Total losses since -- our mitigation of Video losses since October 22. It surpassed our expectations a bit, and it's really combining our bundling content, fast Internet, all-IP experience and our customers love to self-install it, so we've got a -- we've hit a little seam here, and we have some momentum

We love the outcome that we're getting on Video subs, but that's actually not really what we're chasing. We're chasing our segmentation strategy and adding high customer lifetime value subs. And by doing so, when changing all of our sales and churn channels to high-value segments, you can see a pretty material shift in mix in our Consumer business today. So subscribers matter a lot, but anchoring them in segmentation and customer lifetime value is really what winning looks like in our modern Shaw

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director of Telecommunication Services &amp; Canadian &amp; U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [9]

Maybe just a couple of very quick follow-ups. One on Wireless, Paul. On the ARPU greater than '20 versus '19, are you referring to the actual dollar or the growth -- the ARPU growth being higher than 2019?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [10]

The ARPU growth percentage being higher than 2019

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director of Telecommunication Services &amp; Canadian &amp; U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [11]

Okay. And just one follow-up for Jay. So the -- is it fair to say then the -- whether it's gross adds improvement or lower churn, you're seeing the Video base that you're keeping, I guess, higher quality than you would have seen pre BlueCurve Total launch?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [12]

Yes, for sure. And entirely in different segments, you've seen a shift away from -- sort of within the Shaw brand, away from simply driving kind of mobile millennials. And really, BlueCurve is focused on families. It's focused on booming bundles. So Internet and Video churn are both down, which is, of course, what you would expect, and we continue to drive how we plan the 57% of Internet, Internet customers, all that works. What you can't see is Video ARPU is up and it's up over budget as well. So we're ahead of our plans. And that's really because what we've done is we've put the scale of our Video business, quite frankly, leveraging the scale we get also from Satellite, we have scale in our Video business to negotiate better programming agreements that have allowed us do a high-content rich TV package for our customers. And that's enabled us to compete more effectively in segments. You'll see as we move forward, we've fairly dramatically changed all of our sales and churn strategy around those segments. And you'll continue to see those results in families and booming bundles and other segments that drive customer lifetime value significantly lower churn than some of the spaces our gross adds were coming from in the past

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [13]

Our next question comes from Maher Yaghi of Desjardins

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [14]

I'll start with a question for Jay. Just on the BlueCurve plans, I noticed some more aggressive, I would say, pricing structure for these plans with prices around $90 versus a run rate price of $189, $190. Just trying to figure out -- we've had, in the past, some periods where the these plans -- these kind of significant first year prices below the second year price helped on the subscriber front but later on caused some issues on the profitability or the revenue that flows into the second year. What's -- do you -- are you finding that you need to offer these significant discounts to get adoption for BlueCurve? Or what's the strategy behind that -- those significant discounts? And the second question is more related to the overall guidance for the year. With the first quarter at 1%, approximately, growth in EBITDA corrected for IFRS and your guidance of -- for the year, can you maybe just talk through how we should look at the rest of the year, improvements in EBITDA, where they're going to come from and just kind of splitting this between Wireless and Wireline?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [15]

Great. I'll start with your questions, and thanks for that. I think I understand your thinking and how you're thinking about our pricing and packaging. And the challenge with the thinking is you -- it's not with the lens that you can think across the board. We're clearly targeting BlueCurve Total, and it's working at completely different segments than we're, for example, targeting Freedom Home Internet. And so our dual-brand strategy allows us to focus on those segments. Our 2-year value plan customers have a significant reduction in churn over our month-to-month customers. And so the customer lifetime value of customers that are being added on the current model are -- is significantly higher than the customer lifetime value we were adding this time last year

Now recognize, if you compare what our stand-alone month-to-month internet pricing looks like and what our offer is for Canadians to sign up on a 2-year value plan, it looks like it's a deep discount, the math on it, it absolutely works. I think one of the things our competitors are probably struggling with as well is we've got a cost structure now around all of our programming agreements that enables this and, I think, on big packages, gives us a definitive cost advantage vis-à-vis our competitor, and we're clearly going after that as well. So what may look like discounting to you, we're making great money on BlueCurve Total, and it's a great product for us. Again, Video ARPU is up, Internet churn and Video churn are down. I think you'd like the dynamics of what's happening with this space

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [16]

And just on guidance, Maher, we -- I think we spent quite a bit of time on last quarter's call talking about how we're running the business, and it really is about delivery stability within the Wireline side of things. And frankly, Brad's comments and in my comments, Q1 was right on track. We're sort of targeting that $490 million to $500 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis within Wireline. And we feel confident on delivering on that. On Wireless, we continue to see us being able to scale the business and deliver operating leverage. And I think we talked about it last quarter. Again, that will continue to scale during the year. It really is more in Q3, Q4 where you'll see some -- if you look at sort of sequential quarter-over-quarter growth rates within Wireless EBITDA, that's where you start to see the operating leverage within the business really kick in, and it has to do with some of those ARPU and ABPU growth metrics that Paul mentioned earlier in his remarks

So we feel like we're right on track in terms of the quarterly splits, in the delivery of Q1. And again, I would reinforce just the free cash flow, really excited about the delivery of the cash flow this quarter and continue to have a strong conviction in the free cash flow profile of the company going forward, including the approximately $700 million that we're targeting for this year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [17]

Okay. And my last question on Wireless. I'm trying to figure out, it's very hard to understand who is -- who is beginning -- or who is continuing to be the aggressor in the market in the whole scheme of things. When you look at the market in Q4 and how it evolved, some could say it was a reaction to your significant subsidies in the market for iPhones. You say it's the incumbents who are being overly aggressive on the subsidy model. I guess the question is, now that we have seen first move by some of the incumbents to remove those subsidies on iPhone, are -- is that a positive for you to remove some subsidies or you -- your plans and your subsidy model is continuing as is and that's the plan that you're committed to or you hope to remove some subsidies to improve the profitability of the market -- of the business that you're running?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [18]

Maher, it's Paul. You won't be surprised to know that I don't think it's us that's agitating the market right now. If you go back to June 12 of last year, I think you'll get a pretty clear signal on where the market's catalyst was. On the EIP announcement that we've made in recent days, we're going to watch that closely over the coming weeks as it's anticipated to roll out and see what the competition do there. But I think we're probably a few weeks early on a -- for a comment on that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [19]

Our next question comes from Drew McReynolds of RBC Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD of Canadian Telecommunications and Media Research &amp; Analyst   [20]

Two for me. First, Paul, on the Wireless side, could you comment on what you see maybe over the next year or so in terms of your retail distribution footprint? And can you comment at all with your footprint expansion? I guess looking back, let's say, the last 3 or 4 quarters, how much of your kind of incremental loading is attributed to expansion? Or are you, certainly, satisfied with where you're getting that loading across your total footprint?
 And then second question, I guess, maybe for you, Jay. On the base management side, it certainly looks to me when you drill into your Wireline results versus maybe a year or 2 years ago, the base management is certainly improving -- the execution is improving. Where are you from your perspective in terms of that improvement and where you ultimately want to be?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [21]

Drew, it's Paul. On retail footprint over the course of the next year, we've been really, really pleased with the growth over the course of the last 2 years. There's probably 1 or 2 more named retailers that we'll look to bring on over the course of the next 6 months or so, and I think they're a nice positive complement to what we're doing. So you'll continue to see growth on that front. Of course, we continue to focus much of our effort in the major malls in Canada. So you'll have seen us building a number of new corporate stores and renovating those out over the course of last year. And the team has done a great job of really just improving the quality and delivery of our retail experience over the last year. So I'm pleased with where we are there. It's a good positive outcome

On geography, yes, we're starting to see the early contributions from those new markets that we opened over the course of F '19. We saw something like 1% or 2% increase in terms of our gross adds sliding, principally, to the west, that I indicated, I think in the last couple of calls that we would start to see a subtle shift over time as we add markets like Victoria into the mix. So we are starting to see a stronger contribution from the west, which we're pleased to see those have been great markets for us as we start them up

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [22]

And Drew, you're correct, everything's about base management in consumer and so proud of the work that the team is doing, both on revenue and through MRR and also to your value plan now at 57% of internet subs and continuing to grow and continuing to also lower churn in our key categories. Where we are in terms of the industry is we're certainly, with Internet churn, beneath a number of our North American peers. But within the Canadian context and as we continue to drive, we've got some room for improvement here. I think the F '20 story is largely about churn improvement in Consumer. And there's room in F '21 and maybe opportunities with new products in the future, as you can well imagine. So this is our total focus. Love the work the team is doing. We've made good headway, but lots of head -- lots of upside still ahead here

Our next question comes from David McFadgen of Cormark Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David John McFadgen,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Director of Institutional Equity Research   [24]

Two questions. First of all, just on the Video, Cable subs. Obviously, you've made some big improvements there on the losses this quarter sequentially. And I was just wondering if you think you can continue to make improvements like that or you've done a good job and it's probably going to continue to track at this level. And then secondly, given that you've finished deploying the 700-megahertz spectrum in Western Canada, if we were to think just hypothetically, if you wanted to launch Shaw Mobile in DC, in Alberta, like how much would be required in terms of your systems to be able to do that, like billing systems and other systems? Is it quite a bit to do, or it's not really that much and you could go pretty quickly if you decided to do that?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [25]

Great. We'll certainly start with Video, Cable. We continue to be very pleased with how the BlueCurve targeting, which is our focus this year, it's working. It's clear to us that Video losses will improve over F '19. You're seeing extremely strong marketing campaigns that balance results through a pretty solid launch, repositioning Shaw as a technology leader in the consumer space. So whether or not you'll see numbers that look exactly like Q1 numbers, it's really not about us driving a lower Video loss, it's about focusing churn and all of our sales channel on our higher-value segments and our higher-value connected, high-value family customers, our booming bundles, being maximized their lifetime value, bring remarkably low customer churn when you bundle fast home internet with a rich video package. So we're just going to keep doing that, and we're confident we're going to see Cable, Video improvements over F '19, but results of -- probably got a result in Q1 that reflects the strength of the marketing campaign around our launch and some of the excitement around the packaging

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [26]

David, it's Paul. Thanks for the question on 700 and deployment in the west. You're right to point out, we've been thrilled with the work the engineering and IT teams have done in order to get that up and running. So we're in a great shape. That is largely complete now in the west. In terms of system requirements and the potential launch of a second brand, nothing to really report on that today. You're going to see us maybe talk about that or get into some customer-facing things in the next number of quarters, but nothing of significance to report today

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David John McFadgen,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Director of Institutional Equity Research   [27]

Okay. But I mean, would there be a big upgrade required in the systems at Shaw to be able to launch Shaw Mobile and using Freedom's assets?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wireless   [28]

Well, just sort of at the hypothetical level, your -- if you launch any additional brand on our platform, I think our systems are well capable of dealing with that just as the incumbents have multiple brands hanging off similar systems. So I don't think that's a huge lift. Bigger question is as and when the market might be ready for that, and we're not really going to get into that too much today

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Vince Valentini of TD Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [2]

And first, my deepest condolences, Brad, to you and your family and the whole Shaw organization. Obviously, J.R. was not just a great business leader and builder, but an absolutely wonderful man, and he'll be missed by everybody

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive Chair &amp; CEO   [3]

Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [4]

I'll try to leave you alone and direct my questions to your Union President, Paul McAleese. (inaudible) on the appointment. I have 2 questions for you. One on Wireless, one on the Wireline and Cable business. On Wireless first. I know you warned us on the Q1 call in January that there could be a bit of an increase in churn, given what was going on in December, and it obviously came through that way. Can you talk a little bit about how the quarter progressed? Did February calm down a little bit versus some elevated levels in -- earlier on in the quarter? And then also, what are your thoughts on what happens to both churn and equipment costs now that we've entered the social distancing period? That's the one on Wireless. I'll throw out the Wireline one to you just so you can have both. You're obviously, a bit newer to the Cable and Consumer business. And just wondering if you have any early perspectives on that business that you can share with us today?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [5]

Vince, thank you very much for those. Yes, I'm very happy to report that while churn was certainly at a level that was elevated during the last quarter, we saw a really marked improvement in the period between December and February. So you'll recall that we were rolling off the original iPhone cohort from the late December 2017 period. And as I said, I think our team did a great job of managing that really for the first time, a program of that scale. But just for contrast, the churn rate February versus December was about 100 bps lower. So we saw a really sort of significant reduction in that. Rolling forward, of course, with the level of activity or the lack of activity that you're seeing in the marketplace today, I would expect to see churn fall to record low levels. I suspect, across all operators, you'll see that. And we'll be reporting more on that, obviously, in July, but we've definitely seen improvements on that front

On the equipment side of things, with the limited activity we're seeing in retail, we will expect to see elevated levels of EBITDA relative to expectations, of course, because of the dilutive effect of growth. This quarter, in some respects, is going to be essentially a loss quarter for growth for wireless. There's just simply not enough activity at the top of the bucket. So expect to see a relatively neutral performance there or worse

And equipment, well, one part of the equation, I suspect, will be -- we'll have a very solid EBITDA performance to report driven by the lack of equipment activity. So does that answer those questions for you?

Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [6]

Yes, sir

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [7]

Flip to questions of Consumer. It's early days. It's funny, I guess, I officially start today. So thank you for the kind words. It's been interesting to me to spend more time with the team and get under the hood, and we have this fantastic franchise that we've built over the years here and that management have nurtured to a great spot. A number of observations I'd make, and I think these really represent opportunities across the western footprint. My first observation is that there's this striking and probably, frankly, inexplicable to me, difference between Internet pricing in Eastern Canada versus Western Canada, something I think I've always known, but think never really appreciated the depth of which. And I use maybe as example, Vince, the gig pricing. If you visited the Rogers and the Bell websites today, you'd find that gigabit pricing in western -- or rather in Eastern markets is kind of harmonized at about $115. And clearly, the market has judged that to be the appropriate price point for that kind of premium tier of service

If you move westward, Telus has launched gig at $85, which is this sort of -- at least for me, this perplexing Western Canada discount. And that discount really continues right down the rate card. It's just a lot less expensive in Western Canada. While we've yet to launch our gig service, and frankly, I would say Shaw hasn't necessarily been any more disciplined on this front. But it seems like both competitors have been very focused on volume versus quality. That's evident when you look at the lower Wireline margins of ourselves and Telus relative to our Eastern Canadian peers. And moving forward, we're going to want to make sure that we have adequate fuel to manage the significant demand surges that we've seen across our footprint in recent weeks. I suspect those won't relent anytime soon

Second observation on Consumer is what I would really describe as a sort of jarring level of competitive intensity in the west relative to the east. And despite the near maturity of the Internet category, it's odd that in an industry that's approaching 100% penetration, the value of all this back and forth between ourselves and our competitor trading customers, it's not clear to me sort of the value of that. So it kind of brings -- when you look at recent weeks, it brings these strategies under even greater scrutiny for me. I think our -- the utility of our Internet product is at an all-time high. It's being consumed at record levels. It's performing at spectacular thresholds. If we're going to continue to support the massive and structural surge that we've seen in usage, we need to ensure that our pricing supports the investment and the yield that's required. So it's early days. I would say, though, that we're looking very carefully at the rate card. And I would just say, continue to watch this space

Our next question comes from Jeff Fan of Scotiabank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director of Telecommunication Services &amp; Canadian &amp; U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [9]

Let me express my condolences to Brad and the family and the team as well. I hope all of you guys are doing well. I've got a couple of questions. I'll start on the Internet. The self-install more than 50% in the quarter, clearly impressive and especially going to 100%, perhaps that's because of the situation we're in. Are you seeing a bit of a pickup in activation because of your ability to self-install just because I think the telcos have -- tend to have a tougher time to do self-install just because of the way the network is architected? And then the second part to that Internet question is whether there is any switching happening in the early weeks from places where there isn't fiber deployed by your competitors as more people work from home probably need as robust a broadband network as you need?
 And then the second question is on Wireless. Paul, you mentioned Q3 is probably a bit of a loss quarter. And depending on how long this goes, if it goes through the summer, Q4 might be a bit of a loss quarter as well in terms of activations. But if you look across the valley, post COVID-19, how do you think about the landscape? Because by then, we're going to have more pent-up demand for upgrades, we're going to have people with older phones that are looking to upgrade. Do you have any early thoughts as you may cross the valley? I know this is still early in how that landscape may look

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [10]

Jeff, on self-install, yes, I'm so pleased that we made the investments in recent years that we did and the team whether a little bit -- a bit of good planning and a bit of good luck, I suppose, that we were able to take such advantage of it right now. And it's been -- the customer experience has been fantastic. So we're getting great reviews on this. I'd say it's maybe a little early to tell whether there's really any competitive pickup there. There hasn't been a lot of activity on switching, to answer the second part of your question directly. And while you're right, there is the advantage of our self-install relative to a fiber install for our competitor, I think as an industry, frankly, we've all done a good job of accommodating the kind of demand for customers to be able to do some of this on their own. So I wouldn't anticipate a significant pickup there. Honestly, across the board, I think all the major players have done a good job of making sure that customers feel safe in their homes and supported. So as an industry, I would give us a broad amount of credit and not suggest that it's going to create a surge in opportunity for us

We -- on the wireless question, post COVID. Yes, I mean, I think we are in a great place. We're really well positioned competitively, both during the pandemic, and I think, post pandemic. So I'd pull that apart into 2 pieces, Jeff. During, we have, of course, as you know, lower ARPU and probably, fair to say, more overall value than the incumbents. So I think that makes us a less vulnerable household expense than some of our peers. I've had a number of specific instances where people that are on fairly expensive competitive plans have reached out to me in recent days and made the cut over to Freedom simply because they're starting to spend more time looking at their bills than maybe they would have in a pre-COVID world. So I like what that signals for me, it's early days and it's a small sample, but those things usually come true. As you exit the pandemic, and we emerge from this crisis, the value position that we've established for Freedom in the last 2 to 3 years is going to resonate even more with Canadians. And it happens to coincide with essentially the completion of our 700 build. We've done such a strong job with our retail distribution, when all that opens back up and the market sort of starts to seek -- starts to open up again. I think you're surmising this correctly

You're going to see a lot of wear and tear on funds over this kind of close down period. We're seeing certainly a quiet period for upgrades, quiet period for new sales. There's going to be a definite surge. Hard to say where Apple is with their new product introduction in September. We won't know that until the rest of the market. But if they were to come back out with that, you can only imagine that emerging at sort of, some point in the summer, seeing that new product introduction and then all the other things factoring in, I really like where we sit as an opportunity. We're -- we've worked hard to establish ourselves as a high-value player for consumers. And you've seen the same numbers that I have when you see some of the employment figures, these are all households that are going to be looking for better value, but they're not going to be coming out of the Wireless category. So I like where we sit

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [11]

Our next question comes from Tim Casey of BMO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Equity Research Analyst   [12]

I too would like to express my sympathies to Brad, specifically, and to everyone at Shaw. Paul, a couple of questions for you. Just -- it might be too early, but are you -- is there any indication on any implications for supply chain disruption with respect to the expected surge in demand or for all the pent-up demand for phones and whatnot. Any indications on that? And just on the video -- or pardon me, on the Wireline side, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing or what you expect to see in terms of video mix and specifically, how are you treating your sports channels now in terms of credits to customers or whatnot? Because obviously, sports has been so important to keeping the traditional bundle. And I acknowledge that, that's not your focus, but it's still a profitable part of the bundle. If you could just address how you're looking at that?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [13]

Yes. I'd be happy to, Tim, and thanks for your kind words off the top there. On supply chain, we've been really fortunate. There was a few days of darkness where we didn't really have a lot of communication with the major OEMS. I'm just referring to Wireless to start with. And they simply didn't know how their pipeline was going to read. But we -- thanks to the strength of the balance sheet, we've always got a reasonably good inventory position. And we entered this -- the pandemic with a decent size holding. It's been very clear that in recent days, that sort of pipeline looks to be back up and running. So we don't anticipate any issues. Of course, diminished volumes help us there, Tim, as well, right? So we're not we're not seeing a huge surge in demand, but we seem to be getting really good signals from the major OEMs, and that seems quite comfortable. So no real issues there

On the Wireline, trying to answer a question you didn't ask. We likewise have great continuity of supply for all of our major residential CPE as well. So I think across the board, we're in good shape there. So nice to see the supply chain kind of opening up a little bit again rather than where it was a few weeks ago

On Wireline and the video mix and sports, it's a very dynamic situation, as you can imagine, a little color on this. The sports leagues, almost 2 or 1, of course, have not formally canceled their seasons. I know that all of them are looking at options on how they might be able to recover, particularly the ones that are kind of heading towards the playoffs. So they're all looking at options in that regard. I'll let them comment on that specifically, but it does put the people that own the sports rights into a tricky position

We've been fortunate. We haven't seen a great deal of customer inquiry around that. So it hasn't been a pressure point for us. When we get formal notification, if, in fact, these seasons are canceled, that may affect the economics. And if that does, then we'll look at how that might affect the customer billing. At this point, it's actually been sort of fairly static. Customers aren't asking networks -- rather major league -- sports leagues are not canceling. I suspect all of that will change over the course of the next couple of weeks as we hear more about specifically basketball and hockey. But there'll be more to follow there. But right now, it's actually been a fairly flat conversation, and nothing really to report on that front

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Equity Research Analyst   [14]

Have you seen a noticeable uptick yet on the other side on the more general entertainment and movie packages?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [15]

Yes. We've seen a nice uplift in video-on-demand, whether people are just reaching the end of Netflix or what's happening, but it's been a nice short-term lift there, a little more entertainment at home. Compensating, again, for the lack of sports program, I suspect, Tim, as well. So that's been decent. Of course, those are relatively small numerators on our video denominator, but it is good to see good signs of life there. The long-term trend for video hasn't abated. But certainly, the moment where you're turning your home into your primary entertainment instead of almost a cinema, you've seen some of the studios move up their leases and move things right past theatrical and into VOD. So we've had nice uplift from that. But I suspect that the long-term trend on video will remain where it was after this

Our next question comes from Maher Yaghi of Desjardins

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [17]

And I also would like to offer my condolences to Brad and to the Shaw family, team. Ask you maybe just a question on Wireless. With how -- trying to understand a little bit better the consequences of a lower churn in the upcoming quarters on your operation. Can you share with us how much of your net additions during a typical Q3 or Q4 are due to churn customers from incumbents, so customers who are taking a new plan not churning from somebody else?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [18]

Yes. You just blipped a little bit there. I think I picked up the majority of that, Maher. The significant majority of our existing customers are from other carriers that are reporting in a number. So that lack of market activity is one of the reasons that you're seeing us with kind of relatively flat to down performance expectations for this quarter. So we operate best and thrive most in an active environment where people are out shopping and comparing value. And we've always thrived in that scenario. So we are very measured in our expectations for the next 60 or 90 days

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [19]

Right. Exactly. So when I look at -- in a period where churn is likely to be significantly down, you are going to be saving quite a bit of cost on your closures of stores. And on handset subsidies, you are going to be also likely saving a lot of money on that. I'm trying to get a sense on -- when you talk about EBITDA continuing to grow for the year, if we break it down from -- in Wireless versus Wireline, would it be fair to say that on the Wireless side, you actually could end up with the year up on versus your prior expectations, while Wireline would be lower than your prior expectations

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [20]

Yes. Maher, it's Trevor. That's a fair conclusion. That's exactly right. Yes. In the near term, the financial performance of our Wireless business is -- it's probably, frankly, either on plan or slightly ahead of our original guidance. But clearly, there's some more risk in our Wireline business than what we're striving to achieve, which is a very consistent $490 million to $500 million of quarterly EBITDA, and of course, on liquidity pre-IFRS 16 numbers. But you're exactly right

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [21]

Right. So if I take it one step further and I look at 2021. So this I guess, lack of loading that you're doing in Wireless and as there's pent-up demand, what kind of strategy can you implement to make up for the lost time of not loading customers? You are going to be facing probably a refresh cycle from your existing customer base, which -- who took iPhones a couple of years ago. You also have a bunch of new customers that will churn at the same time. I'm trying to figure out the impact on your working cap, on your cash flow requirements at the same time, as we have 5G coming up probably next year with the spectrum auction and investment in that. So like how do you view free cash flow in that context in 2021?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [22]

Well, let me pull apart a couple of bits and parts of that question. So first off, I don't know that we make up for lost ground here. I think the subscribers ultimately -- when the market is stalled this way, I don't know that we all of a sudden see an extra 100,000 subscribers that show up in September and October. So it will just have a notch full rhythm to it. But I would say it's fair to say this probably puts a temporary hold on growth, and that sort of over multiple years will catch up, but it's not going to happen within a quarter

In terms of how this rolls into free cash flow expectations and 5G investments. I think those are all -- this is a relatively modest bump in the road for us. If you think about the impact of adding 50,000 or 60,000 or 70,000 new subscribers on a subscriber base of 1.8 million, and you can do the math, it's just simply not going to be that meaningful in terms of its contribution in the next 6 to 12 months. So I don't think it really puts any of our planning for 5G investments or network into jeopardy here

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [23]

Yes. Maher, it's probably premature to talk about F '21 and a lot of granularity considering where we're at with the environment. But I would say and sort of go back to the strength of the balance sheet, the strength of liquidity regarding spectrum acquisitions costs around the 3,500 and capital required to build our business as we have to probably slow some things down. We've got lots of levers here and lots of financial strength to operate in that environment in F '21 when we're through this

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [24]

That's fair. That's fair. And my last question -- and I agree with you, it's tough to put new guidelines, not knowing when this pandemic is going to be over. You mentioned about the free cash flow. My last question is on CapEx. How much CapEx reduction do you expect at this point in time that you'll see because of this pandemic happening? Is it a significant or material reduction in CapEx that you're now looking at or -- in 2020? Or not material?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [25]

Yes. Again, it's difficult to answer that. We can -- frankly, we hope that's not a material reduction in capital expenditures if we can get back to business as normal quick. But if you look at, for example, year-to-date capital within housing development and success-based capital, that was about $200 million in the first half of the year. Clearly, that category is not going to be as high in Q3 and Q4 with -- in the context of the environment. But it's very difficult to, again, hard to precisely predict how much less -- how much sort of CapEx relief, and I really think of it more as deferral of capital in F '20 because of the environment. And I think that's why we did -- we pulled or withdrew our previous guidance, but we tried to give some comfort around EBITDA growth still this year. And free cash flow is substantially in line. We just need a little bit more flexibility considering the uncertain environment

Our next question comes from Drew McReynolds of RBC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD of Canadian Telecommunications and Media Research &amp; Analyst   [27]

And condolences to you, Brad, and the Shaw family and the organization. And to you, Paul, congrats on the position. A couple of follow-ups on my end, maybe starting with you, Paul, on the -- just on the government pricing objective on the 2- to 6-gig plan. Can you talk to your big picture view on how you're positioned relative to that? And we certainly did see a little bit of jockeying before the crisis hit from the incumbents? Would love your perspective on that. And then second, maybe for you, Trevor, just some housekeeping. In terms of the cash restructuring costs, they are below what you originally provisioned for in the -- the TBT program seems to be substantially complete. Are you expected to kind of meet the full $437 million in cash restructuring? And just second question on the pension funding status. Just remind us, frankly, where that sits. I don't -- I think you locked a lot of that exposure down a few years ago, but an update there would be great

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [28]

Sure. I'll take it first, Trevor

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [29]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [30]

Thanks, Drew, for the kind words. We're big believers in driving greater Wireless value for Canadians, and that's really been the ethos. We've been running this company since we acquired it some years ago. And I think the regional carriers have demonstrated that they have been the drivers of change and the drivers of value in the market really specifically over the last 2 or 3 years, but without us, I think you'd still see the incumbents in a very different place on pricing. So the availability of affordable Wireless is widespread. It may not necessarily exist on the incumbents, but it's certainly available with our subs and our regional peers. And that quality of product, as you know, has increased substantially over the last 2 years specifically. So I'd start by saying that some of this, to me, still looks like a solution to a problem that isn't obvious to me

So with specific reference to the government's 25% sort of directive on 2- to 6-gig plans, we're seeing a natural growth of data usage that's going to push a lot of customers that might be in that bucket today up into a post 6 or a larger than 6-gig plan 2 years from now regardless. You'll recall, Drew, this isn't a staged reduction. It's simply a moment in time. So it's kind of a balance sheet snapshot of it. 2 years from now, the government will take a read and [wouldn't] want to see that decline. It's fine. It's not really going to affect us. I suspect it a great percentage of the market. So probably not an overwhelming measure in the market by the time it's done. Look, we applaud the government's initiative to try and drive change. But we think the market does that best, and we've been demonstrating that really for the last number of years. So it's -- that's really how we have to say on that. I'll hand over to Trevor

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [31]

Yes. Thanks, Paul, and thanks, Drew, for the questions. Just on the restructuring costs. So we're about $390 million into the VDP payments. And we've got about 200 folks left or so that are leaving post Q2, Drew. But just want to remind everyone that we did offer employees the option to defer the payments over 2 tax years. So there will be some payment -- residual payment that's left that gets paid out in January 2021 of that $50 million. That's why it looks like a relatively large number for a relatively few number of employees to leave the company

On the pension status. As of February 28 -- or the end of the quarter, pardon me, February 29, we're at about 85% from a funded perspective. And post quarter end, clearly, there's been a lot of movements, specifically also with executive changes. But also -- which will reduce the liability, but also with volatility in the equity markets, which will obviously have an impact on the asset side of things. So net-net, though, we don't expect a material change from the funding status, but I guess we'll have to wait to see where the interest rate environment and corporate spreads go on our quarter end of May 31

Our next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Unidentified Analyst,    [33]

It's actually [Matthew] on for David. And allow me to extend my condolences as well for the passing of J.R. So my first question is, I just wanted to clarify, I'm pretty sure you are indicating that the EBITDA growth that you're expecting, it's pre-IFRS, if I'm not mistaken, it's not post-IFRS. I just want you to clarify that. And then on the Wireless side, assuming that this current situation could potentially last an unknown length of time, I was just curious about what percentage of Wireless sales or gross adds that you can generate -- have been generating in a normal environment from the online channel. And if you see capacity for that to potentially increase? And also, it sounds like the consumer behavior hasn't really changed as of yet, given the dramatic change in circumstances. You've already spoken to kind of the video packages. It sounds like you haven't seen much movement aside from VOD. But in a typical slowdown or recession, how long does it typically take in the Wireline business to start to have customers reaching out to make changes. It's been said on the call that a lot of these services are kind of indispensable. And I don't suspect lots of people will drop them. But just in terms of generating calls and to make money saving kind of optimization changes, like when would that -- you expect to see that behavior?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [34]

Maybe I'll start, Paul. Matthew, thank you. Yes. It's on pre-IFRS 16 in terms of EBITDA growth. But obviously, on a post-IFRS basis, it's also positive, even better. So yes and yes. Paul?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [35]

Matthew, it's Paul. On your question about online sales. We have, as an industry, really been challenged by this model. It's difficult in Canada, given where there unfortunately is a very high degree of fraud with -- when we open this up. We have had some success, and we'll continue to have success in shipping phones or upgrading phones to people with whom we already have an existing relationship. So that's obviously something that we can progress on. And we've had a bit of an uptick in recent weeks with the sale of prepay SIMs online, which, of course, carries a much lower attendant risk because we're not shipping phones. So I wouldn't -- I would put -- by the way, our online sales are like less than 1% of our total growth. It's almost de minimis. And I don't expect that it will move significantly from that. So unfortunately, the wider you open the aperture of that, the more risk you assume and the more fraud you seem to find. So don't expect, at least with our view of the risk, don't expect us to look to widen that channel anytime soon

On your question about consumer behavior, how long? It's funny. It will come in stages. It probably took about a minute when all this hit for the first customer to call and look to change their behavior. But it's, again, been a relatively small numerator of people who have called and look to affect their pricing with us. Trevor and I were chatting earlier today and during the last recession, and admittedly a different time and different circumstances, but we didn't see significant declines in consumer demand for our product. And I would say that Internet now is materially more critical for the management of a home, particularly with things like in-home education and stuff now. So having that turn down relative to all the other discretionary expenses in household, it's just not something that's going to come in big waves. It's certainly -- we're definitely going to see individuals that are going to have to cut back, and we're going to definitely see some cancellations like I outlined

But in the main, we have a really high degree of confidence in where this is going to settle out. Wireless has its own unique retention capability, but Internet is just -- and you're all experiencing, it is just reaching a level of utility in a household that it simply never experienced before. So when you look at the kind of the cost per day of this and what you get out of it, we're just not seeing that many -- that much pressure on the top line here. So -- and we're encouraged by that. We'll continue to see changes in those performance -- in that performance as we see more and more people unfortunately hitting the unemployment figures. But for now, we're really pleased with the performance

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) The first question is from Vince Valentini with TD Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [2]

I echo I don't really like the timing of this call, but I appreciate the fact that it wasn't because you were going to miss consensus numbers with the results you put up, congrats on that. Maybe a couple for Paul, but one quick one for Trevor first is this $5 million increase in bad debt expense, it seems pretty low to me. Is this like a realized amount? Or are you making estimates of what future results could be, like basically taking provisions for the future based on economic activity?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [3]

It's based on -- the analysis that we did was really based on the future, Vince. Obviously, unemployment rates, we did -- we looked at other periods when there was high levels of unemployment in Western Canada and even in Eastern Canada. In the Wireless segment, we're still -- we haven't noticed -- we're watching the receivables closely on a daily basis, and it's holding up really well, Vince. But we still have some concerns going forward, specifically as some of the stimulus programs come unwound through the government, what does that mean for bad debt and customers' ability to pay their bills? I will just say, Vince, I think it was disclosed in our '19 annual, there's roughly about $40 million of bad debt in our EBITDA on an annual basis. So an incremental $5 million, it's about a 12% increase on that current run rate. So -- but it is really more about looking forward in the provision that we've made going forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [4]

Okay. One Wireless and one Wireline question. Wireless, I think you've pushed back at me in the past, when I've said can Wireless margins eventually get to 40% when the business matures and growth slows down? And I think you've kind of talked me down to -- the industry down to the mid-30s. This quarter, you did 40%. I mean it was a bit of an unintended experiment to shut down all sales activity, but doing 40%, obviously there's some boost from IFRS 16 that you may have not have thought of a couple of years ago, but is 40% a realistic goal a few years down the road once the business matures?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [5]

Vince, yes, thanks for the reminder of our history together. We're loving what the last quarter demonstrated in terms of the leverage that our Wireless business already has in it. But I would still be cautious given the downward pressure that we're seeing on retail pricing and some of the activity that you're seeing out of the Big 3, particularly on unlimited. It is increasingly difficult to get the ARPU boosts that we might have forecasted 4 years ago. Obviously, we had a very strong quarter, but it was against the climate. It is very challenging with the Big 3. So I'd still be cautious there, but it certainly was -- I'd be more confident now than I would have been 2 years ago on that mid-30s target. But yes, I'd still be wary of 40% at this point

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [6]

Yes. I think, Vince, I'll just add, when we looked at the sort of the quarterly expense reductions in Wireless, about $10 million of that was related to sort of commercial costs related to growth that really, frankly ground to a halt. Yes, there's some G&amp;A discretionary costs. Advertising spend was at an all-time low, I would say, during the quarter. So while the 40% margin, I don't want us to sort of -- any of us get too far over our skis, that that's something in the near term. We really do hope that we can come back to sort of scaling and growing this business with subscriber activity and putting the subsidy dollars to work where it makes sense and have a very balanced scorecard on customer growth and profitability

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [7]

It was a lovely test of your thesis though, Vince, in terms of just what this thing can produce when we get to a degree of maturity, and where I think we demonstrated nicely that as you pull back on the engines, it can very strongly throw off a lot of free cash flow and EBITDA

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [8]

Okay. And sorry, one last one on Wireline. You mentioned the downward trend on ARPU in Wireless. I'm wondering about the upward ARPU trend in broadband. Now that you've put these new prices in place as of the end of May, do you have any initial data on what new sub adds and maybe anybody renewing, what the ARPU on those customers looks like versus the legacy base of customers?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [9]

Yes. I'll pull those into 2 pieces. So on the new subscribers, and a reminder that the pricing that we launched on May 27 was for new subscribers in the vast majority of instances, we've seen a nice lift, not surprisingly. The -- we're seeing as much volume, for example, our former highest rate plan was 600 speed tier. And that percentage of volume that came from that tier is now the same percentage of volume that we're getting from our 750 and Gig speed tiers. So we've seen the market shift nicely to the right on that front. And not surprisingly, when you put it on the mix, seeing the kind of changes we saw in rate that we are producing a much stronger cohort now, which I think, frankly, Vince, is reflective of the investments we've made. I mean we've spent hundreds of millions of dollars in the last number of years on improving the reliability and speed of that plant. And this is an appropriate price for that. I think we've seen that and when you start to look east -- sort of east to west here

So new subscribers definitely coming in on a meaningful lift. And maybe the thing that will produce more value over time as we speak with current customers who are either renewing or migrating, we've managed in 1 quarter to turn that from something that has historically been a dilutive conversation to one that's now accretive. So in the old days, when we spoke with the customer, it cost us money. And now because of the availability of higher speeds, and frankly the demand related to COVID and the pressures on residential Internet speeds and just the greater utility we're demonstrating, we've managed to turn that into something that's a positive for us. So it's been a very favorable last 6 weeks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [10]

Our next question comes from Drew McReynolds with RBC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD of Canadian Telecommunications &amp; Media Research and Analyst   [11]

Back on this for you, Paul, just to broaden the conversation over the past 6 weeks. Interested, I know in the opening remarks, Brad and Trevor provided some commentary around kind of how the business is evolving here as we go forward. Can you just flush more of that out? What are -- what kind of sequential improvement are you seeing across the business, particularly as we've gone into the June and July period?
 And then secondly, and maybe related to that, Shaw has been through a couple of recessions before. Have you really seen the recessionary behavior kind of rear its head here, whether that's folks kind of tiering down, cord cutting, cord shaving? You've talked a little bit on the business side, but there does appear to probably be a little lag here once we get through fiscal support through the unusual 3 or 4 months here. I would just love to hear your thoughts if we're still kind of not out of the woods, particularly on the broader kind of recessionary impacts on the business

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [12]

Yes. I'll start with -- in reverse order, if I could, maybe Trevor will pipe in as well. It is early on this because we're still seeing so much federal support for the folks that have been impacted by the pandemic. It is difficult to tell where this is all going to flush out and when that stops. When the music stops, there's definitely going to be a degree of pressure on this household. So, so far, to Brad's opening comments, we've weathered it very well, right up until even today, we haven't seen any dramatic changes in customer behavior. So a nice stable franchise as we like to discuss internally here. Nothing really to kind of flag at this point

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [13]

Yes. Maybe I'll just add, Drew. I mean part of the analysis we did do as an accounting team, we went back and looked at sort of other periods of unemployment levels and things. I mean frankly, on the Wireless side, we didn't see any correlation. People just kept paying their bills just for that service. And again, I think it goes back to the ARPU from that perspective that it's fairly good value for less than $40. So people tended to pay their bills. On the Wireline side of things, not all recessions are the same. And I think that's why we're a little bit cautious on this one to sort of declare any sense of that we're out of the woods. We're still a bit nervous

That being said, in '14 and other periods when there were some oil price challenges, I'd say our business held in fairly well. There was a bit more cord cutting and cord shaving on the Video category during that time period, but it was fairly modest and immaterial, but it is one thing that we're just watching very, very closely. No material changes to date, but it is something that we're still concerned about going forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [14]

And then, Drew, on the first part of your question, I'll speak a little bit to June, but I don't want to get too far ahead of kind of guidance on this thing. We spent, from May 27 until July 8, materially above the retail price points of our primary competitor in the West, and still managed to have a strong month and not see a major competitive shift, which is encouraging. So prospectively, I think that's something that we're confident we'll get back to kind of a normal 50-50 share of net is the way that I view our objective here

Frankly, for the last 3 years or so, we have underperformed on that. Some of that is attributable to the improvements that our competitors have seen on fiber to the home. But as that sort of starts to hit a wall, our expectation, to be plain, is that we will get a 50% share of net broadband activations going forward very soon. And I'm pleased now that we have retail pricing that is more reflective of the investments that we've made so that we're getting the appropriate return on that. And then we're ensuring that our customer experience -- you asked about kind of what else happened in the last number of weeks and months, and we've done a number of things. We started to see pretty significant changes in the way we're able to service customers

So Brad talked about that 72% self-install, we've even seen that number increase in recent weeks. We have moved a huge amount of customer contact into platforms that are more efficient for us and more efficient for customers, things like messaging improved and ramped up materially over the course of the initial months of the pandemic and have stayed there. We've taken a lot of steps to improve our call-center activity. So early on, frankly, we were a little bit overwhelmed by some of the surges in demand for contact. That's flattened out, and we've done a better job of meeting it

We are also now getting our arms around more of our sort of value-based service model. So where in the past we had a sort of peanut-butter approach and spread our care around equally, in the future and really just kind of starting now, Drew, you'll start to see us segment our care to higher-value models

So again, looking to take our best tenured, higher-value customers and have a slightly different treatment for them than we would for customers with lower economic value for us. So we're kind of marrying up those 2 investments. So we've used this opportunity, I think, quite thoughtfully in the last 90 days. We've tightened up some things that needed tightening up. Everything from how long it takes us to answer the phone to how long it takes us to ship a modem have improved over the course of the last 90 days and we'll continue to improve. And customers are responding, and I suspect now because we've got closer to parity with our competitor on the cost of Internet. We love where we are positioned right now. So it's been a good 90 days

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [15]

The next question comes from Jeff Fan with Scotiabank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director of Telecommunication Services &amp; Canadian &amp; U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [16]

I've got a couple of questions, one for Trevor and then another for Paul. For Trevor, it's regarding the guidance, you guys posted a very good quarter financially. You kept your guidance for the year as adjusted EBITDA growth. It sort of implies that Q4 is going to be down, that something is going to happen. So I'm wondering if, is there something that you're forecasting regarding the fourth quarter. Or this is just about being a bit more on the conservative side? And that would pertain, I guess, to both EBITDA and free cash flow

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [17]

Thanks, Jeff. I guess at this stage, it's probably more conservatism. We're feeling really good about the business. Obviously, really happy with the financial performance of Q3. That being said, there's still volatility in the business, talked a little bit about bad debt. We talked a little bit about just deferring some of the payments and costs in Q3 versus Q4 on Wireline as well. On Wireless, you've seen what happens to EBITDA with volume and when the gross sales activity is down so much. It's still difficult, I think, for us to sit here on July 10 to say what does the back-to-school environment look like? And obviously, that's an important point in time for the category of Wireless but also Wireline

So I think we're being probably overly cautious. Clearly, we don't see anything scary as we sit here on July 10. The June numbers are in; we're feeling really good about the business. We withdrew our formal guidance of 4% to 5% EBITDA growth last quarter. We know consensus is right around 2% in terms of what that is after we withdrew that last quarter. And we're feeling comfortable with the business, Jeff, but we just didn't see a lot of benefit putting in a new range at this time for the last few months of the year. And hopefully, we'll be back in October talking about F '21 and talking about an F '21 guidance in an environment that has a little bit more -- is a little bit more stable and a little bit more predictable going forward-looking into the next fiscal year

And again, free cash flow, I think we still have the levers. You can see that we didn't pull back on capital. We didn't need to. In fact, some of the capital projects that we thought were going to go a bit slower actually accelerated, and we think that's good capital to spend in the business. So we're happy with that. And clearly, our free cash flow profile of the company is extremely strong

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director of Telecommunication Services &amp; Canadian &amp; U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [18]

Maybe just a couple of very quick follow-ups, Trevor. You mentioned some trends regarding the business revenue and some of the suspensions. And you quoted some numbers. Did those trends, if you look at it on a month-to-month basis, get worse? Or did things actually stabilize as businesses reopened? And I guess that question may be applying to your $5 million bad debt as well if you think about it from a month-to-month basis

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [19]

Yes. And some of the bad debt is for business customers as well. That's a good question, Jeff. We're seeing sort of slowly businesses coming back. I would say they may not be coming back at the same level they were. The Video category, for example, and hospitality, we're seeing them come back with their broadband service, but Video, just in light of what's happening still with the sports environment and things. So we're feeling good about the business trends, but the growth profile, the new customers, the funnel, while it's looking okay, we're just a bit nervous in terms of what does that environment actually look like when some of these stimulus programs get pulled back from the government, and we're not sure on the timing of that

We probably expect a little bit of sequential quarter-over-quarter when you look at what happened from Q2 to Q3. Similar trends, not getting any worse, I think, in Q3 to Q4 when you look at what happened with the business revenue side, but probably is still a little bit of downward pressure on Q4 business revenue versus what we posted for Q3 just because of timing of the suspension of the accounts and then when they're actually coming back and then, frankly, some not coming back because of the troubles that they're facing. There's a lot of moving parts in that one

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director of Telecommunication Services &amp; Canadian &amp; U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [20]

I understand. But it sounds like things are going well. Question for Paul. So you talked a little bit about how -- since the plan changes that you made, how things are going. It sounds like you're quite happy with what's going on there. I guess this week, TELUS also made some plan changes. Just wondering if you still feel comfortable, I guess, since July 8, with the changes. Not to put you on the spot about what's happened in the last 2 days unloading, but just in terms of where you sit right now. Do you feel that you can get to that 50-50 share of net adds with the construct that's in place right now?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [21]

Yes. Jeff, I won't speak too much about the TELUS moves. I think they were [a] sensible opportunity for them to recapture some of their significant investment in recent years as well in their plant. So we're pleased and positive with the way that the market is priced currently. I don't think we need to be right on top of each other dollar-for-dollar. There's a reasonably close proximity, and we're comfortable that we'll be able to meet our objectives kind of as things currently stand

We're making a number of other changes that we think will support the business and our objectives there as well. So I spoke about some of them earlier in terms of just the way -- [manner] in which we're going to improve the customer experience. But the team -- the engineering and IT teams have done just a spectacular job in making sure that we have the speed and reliability. I think we caught some people off guard with how little we were impacted on the network side with the surge of COVID. And our customer experience has never been better

We are borrowing some tricks from the old Wireless playbook over the coming weeks. So you'll see a number of additional retail stores, Shaw retail stores open in the West. And those are just, frankly, long overdue, where we've had -- we've been underrepresented in terms of the way that we go to market. So if you were to do a quick tour, you'll see a number of locations ready to open over the coming weeks, and we're excited about having greater retail penetration for our consumer products as well. So I think there's lots of things that contribute to net growth, and we know how to do that. So you'll see a number of things come into play that will help contribute to it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [22]

Our next question comes from Aravinda Galappatthige

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Suranimala Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD   [23]

One Wireless and one Wireline question for me. On the Wireless side, not surprisingly, the industry has seen lower volumes, and you see that in your Q3 as well. But as this sort of period extends, naturally, you're going to see sort of a bigger share of free agents in the market, some pent-up demand as some of these contracts go past their expiry. I wanted to get your thoughts on how you see that as an opportunity for Freedom, given sort of where the economic conditions are and sort of, obviously, your pricing differentials would be incumbent, not trying to get sort of near-term views on Wireless volumes for you guys, but how do you sort of approach that opportunity? That was my sort of Wireless question

And then on the Wireline side, with respect to the price changes in the West, obviously, encouraged by what you said earlier. I think it was Paul, you mentioned that you're seeing the same mix in terms of the subs coming into the higher tiered plans

But given sort of the sticker shock there, the significant change, obviously, that we've seen in the last 6 weeks in terms of pricing there, is there a risk that you get some subscribers that start to move down speed in terms of maybe towards 75 or the 150 because of the sticker shock there? Wanted to get your thoughts on that as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [24]

Aravinda, it's Paul. I'll take those in reverse order as well. It's worth noting that one of the things that may get missed when we launched our rate card on May 27 was we also launched a new entry-level rate -- speed tier for Canadian households. We speak to customers all the time and get their feedback on where we are on kind of meeting their needs. One of the things that emerged very quickly into the pandemic was the households that were under economic pressure and duress needed something different than what was on our card. So we introduced what is, to my knowledge, the lowest-priced, non-government-supported Internet rate tier in Western Canada, a $50 plan that is -- should provide a lot of people the opportunity they need to sort of rationalize their savings. And we've seen good movement into that

So when I talked about the kind of a net of all of those things still being positive, that includes the dilutive effect of a fairly significant number of people that have had the opportunity to move down in terms of their obligation. And we're happy to support that. And we think that's just part of our obligation. And so we've built kind of opportunities for people who wanted to harden their internet and increase their speed tier up to 750 or Gig. We've equally allowed people to go in the other direction, and the net of all that is positive. So I'm quite confident that we have the market kind of well positioned there

On the free agent cohort for Wireless, on paper you're absolutely right. This is a group that's sort of been dragging the puck, if you will, for 4 or 5 months, waiting to get their upgrades or their new phone or deal with it. It's a little bit difficult for us right now to predict where that's all going to go, to Trevor's point, given some of the economic things that may happen toward the end of the summer, in the fall the support programs may cease

The other thing to be mindful of is we've got 2 other things kind of pushing the direction for Wireless. One is a, surprising for me, competitive dynamic that is really quite aggressive. I've seen 20-Gig plans from some -- one of the Big 3 as low as $54, regularly priced at $65. We've had a good part of the last month where the Big 3 had their unlimited plans priced below Freedom. So probably better asking them why they're doing that. But I think that's probably going to be reflected in fairly painful ARPU numbers for them in the coming next little while. So some of you have already reported on what appear to be lowering expectations out of our competition

At a point in time, I don't know where the end of the runway is there, but I'd be starting to get pretty uncomfortable if I were piloting that plane. So we are able to continue to grow as long as we have a rational pricing environment. We tried to demonstrate that on the Wireline side. On the Wireless side, I think we have the exact opposite thing happening with our competition. So that is a negative, if it were to continue proceeding

And then a smaller thing, just to kind of make sure everyone's on the same page, our retail stores, while we've opened, I believe, now 90% of our store doors, our best locations, our highest-volume locations tend to be locations in malls that are not yet thriving or kiosks in malls that are not yet necessarily active. So by no means has traffic returned to Yorkdale and Chinook and Eaton Center [and] Pacific. These are all places that are open, but kind of barely. And for us, we need to see that traffic return to its former glory. We thrive as a Wireless business when customers can go to the mall and shop for carriers and demonstrate our value. When it's quiet this way, this is not on strategy, as Trevor always likes to say, so we do need that to come back. So it's a long answer to short question about that cohort

In theory, they're there, we believe that we will be able to meet them when they are. But there are some things that still have to kind of work their way through, the competitiveness being the primary driver. There's -- when you look at where Unlimited launched last June and where it has tumbled to precipitously, the pricing discipline or lack thereof at some of our competition is astonishing to me

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [25]

Our next question comes from Maher Yaghi with Desjardins

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [26]

Yes. I just want to follow-up on your answer regarding that cohort. Does that include the iPhone cohort a few years ago that started to roll off? And can you discuss maybe some of the churn numbers on that -- on the iPhone cohort? I know it's slow motion right now with the market being down, but have you drawn some conclusions when it comes to churn for the iPhone cohort? I have a few questions after

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [27]

Yes. I want to make sure I just understood it. So our iPhone 8 cohort, which started in December, January, 2.5 years ago now, is largely through and has been completely managed by our base management team. We started that, as you'll recall, Maher, back in sort of late summer, early autumn of last year as they tended toward renewal. But the vast majority of those people have either left us or renewed and moved on to another device or simply renewed their rate plan with us. So that's kind of behind us now. And you'll have seen, by the way, in our ARPU numbers, which I suspect will be category leading that we were able to move them successfully. That's a big part of our base, and we were able to manage that very successfully

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [28]

Okay. Great. I wanted to ask you, some of your large competitors in the East seem to have some -- had some material cost in the second quarter to adjust operations to react to COVID, specifically like customer service and work from home, et cetera. I don't see any material such costs in your results. Can you talk about how you managed this transition and not having to have incurred some large cost to make the change in your operation?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [29]

Yes, Maher, this is Trevor. So there wasn't -- we had some cost savings, frankly, from some temporary layoffs, and you don't see that in the numbers as well. They were somewhat offset by some of the COVID-related costs. We're doing other things like topping up some pay to some folks. We were doing some other things where we made people hold on their pay which included commissions that can't be deferred over a period of time related to customer acquisition activity, so we had the expense set in Q3

So there was a lot of moving parts and -- but other than the bad debt expense that we wanted to call out, they kind of all were a bit of a wash and relatively immaterial. So we didn't have any significant huge onetime cost items related to COVID-19 and that being said, not a significant amount of cost savings related to temporary layoffs and people-related costs. So it's sort of all in the numbers, frankly, in our current run rate

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [30]

Okay. And that 10% of your workforce that you temporarily laid off, how much of those have come back? And are you having trouble getting most of them?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [31]

Well, 50% have already been recalled, and we've had no issues bringing those folks back

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [32]

Correct

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [33]

Okay. So they're not going somewhere else. You're not noticing..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [34]

No, quite the opposite, actually. We're -- they're thrilled to come back. I think they were -- frankly, we've -- Brad empowered us to treat that group of people very, very well over the course of the last number of months. And I think it's paying a dividend right now. We've seen fundamentally all of them come back on request

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [35]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [36]

Okay. One last question is on your normal price increase on Wireline. I noticed in my neck of the wood, we have not had an increase in our base Internet, TV, et cetera. I think it's the same in Ontario from BCE. Are you able to pass a price increase these days on your existing customer base? I noticed and you mentioned that you passed the price increase on your new customers, but how about the base?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [37]

I think as an industry, you saw a really empathetic approach to this. And again, we had a conversation early on with Brad around how we wanted to handle this in terms of -- I think we had one scheduled for April or May, and we've held off on that. We have signaled to customers that, again, we won't be doing anything on that until at least the autumn. And we'll kind of reserve the right to do that. So we'll be well behind our typical timing on that. But we're comfortable that that's the right move in light of the economic pressure that a lot of households are facing. So we've held off. And I do think that that's been mirrored marginally across the industry, which is, again, credit to the way the facilities-based players have managed themselves through the course of this pandemic

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [38]

And the only thing I would also add, Maher, we talked about this, I think, last year, that the annual rate adjustment for Shaw is not as pronounced as it once was. We have so many customers that are on new contracts and at different times of their contracts. So the idea of this sort of onetime big bang of a rate adjustment and what it does to you financially and how you see it in the numbers, I think we're pricing and packaging for customers every day, so that annual event isn't as pronounced as it used to be

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [39]

Okay. And my last question is on churn in general, in the Wireless market. In June, have you started to see that churn increase overall for the industry? And if that's the case it should be good, right, for you guys?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [40]

Yes. I think it's fair to say that June, more toward the end of it, but kind of normal services restored. It's kind of getting back to its regular rhythm, which would instruct that we're not going to see a 0.96% churn rate in the fourth quarter. I don't mind giving guidance on that. The -- I think the industry is just starting to kind of come out of its slumber and we'll be back to kind of normal levels, hopefully, of growth and in churn fairly quickly

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - VP, Telecom, Media &amp; Tech Analyst and Intellectual Property Analyst   [41]

Okay. And can you remind us on your 5G plans, time-wise? I mean you've seen announcement by TELUS, Rogers and BCE. What's your expectations when it comes to 5G and deployment and rollout?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [42]

Yes. We haven't signaled too much. I'll just remind people, I think what we have disclosed is we've been making live calls. We have 5G-ready core. We have been testing here in the Calgary market on a number of sites for a number of months now. Clearly, for us the implementation of 600 is a critical bedrock band for 5G, and we'll be rolling out as quickly as we can unpack it from the broadcast side and get access to it. So for us, it's a -- you'll start to see that more toward, rather, calendar '21. But a lot of -- I said a number of calls ago that we weren't going to conduct our 5G launch by press release. I know there's some opportunity out there, and there's some great working product, but it's early

We are narrowing the gap more increasingly in terms of our time to market behind the Big 3 who, of course, have considerable spectrum advantages over us based on their history. But we're loving our position here, and the network team is well ready for it. So more on that probably on the next call in October that will give you considerably more detail then

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) The first question is from Vince Valentini with TD Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [2]

Three questions. I'll throw them all at you. So you can think about them and decide how to order -- how to answer them in order. One is on dividends. So if we look at your $800 million in free cash flow target for this upcoming year, that would mean dividend payments of about $605 million would be 76% payout ratio. If you increase the dividend 5%, that would take the payout ratio up to 79%. It's not a meaningful difference, still well covered. And as you know, your balance sheet is very strong. So your perspective on if and when we can get back to dividend growth would be very helpful. Number 2 would be on Internet, probably for Paul

Q4 obviously wasn't very pretty in terms of Internet sub adds, but you didn't launch Shaw Mobile until August. And I think there was a lot of distortion in June and July from consumer activity and pricing changes you did relative to TELUS. So if you can give us any context on how maybe September and October look relative to the weaker Q4, I think that would help people a lot

And last, maybe for you as well, Paul, on Wireless churn being up 10 basis points. Can you talk about what's going on there? And specifically, I'm not sure how you -- how you treat it when you have these bounty offers from the incumbents trying to steal your customers. If somebody just wants to sign up for Freedom for 2 or 3 days and then switch to an incumbent to get one of their discounted offers, would you treat that as a gross add and then churn? Or does that not impact the higher churn that we're seeing?

Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive Chair &amp; CEO   [3]

Great. Vince, it's Brad. I just -- I'll talk about the dividend, McAleese will take the other 2 questions. As we know at a macro level, it's the dividend increase from a Board decision and both management and the Board are committed to long-term sustainable dividend growth. I would say right now, today, we pay a very healthy 5% yield. And that being said, we certainly are confident about the long-term free cash flow profile of the company. But I'd say in these uncertain times in this environment, we really prefer the flexibility of share repurchase to return excess capital to shareholders

And I would also say that just looking year-to-date at the Class B shares are down 14%, which creates an attractive price to do the buybacks. And I would just say that we have a great -- significant cash balance, which we can deploy $760 million, which I think is very good use. And we continue to -- well, I would just say we continue to make sure we, in this environment, you want to have sustainable dividend growth over the longer term and it's something we feel that we'll continue to address as we go forward and leave that with the Board to make the right decision

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [4]

Vince, Paul. If you're good on that, I'll pick up on the other 2. On Internet subs, you're right to comment that we had during the early part of the quarter a significant price disadvantage relative to TELUS. You'll recall that we moved to the launch of our Fiber+ Gig program in late May, May 27. And TELUS didn't respond in any way until the first week of July on pricing and not -- and didn't at that point come all the way, so we maintain a price premium through the course of the quarter. So we had a relatively slow start to the quarter

And of course, we didn't launch Shaw Mobile until the very end of July. So the things that we expect will over time help improve are Wireline market share, Internet market share. I describe them as a process. We've been very clear about what our objective is here, and that starts with returning our Internet base to positive subscriber growth. But it's a process with a very deliberate set of moves, not dissimilar to what we did in the Wireless business over the last 2 or 3 years

And while I'm impatient, these are all things that are now underway. So the first thing we did during the quarter [you would have] seen is make sure that we improve the product foundation for Internet. And that began with the launch of those 2 new high-speed tiers, getting Gig into the market to make sure that we were there to address the emerging needs of work from home and the other pressures that we're seeing at the residential Internet level

But overall, we felt that through the course of the quarter, we made and continue to make -- and will continue to make in this quarter significant product enhancements for the customer experience. Those product changes are not going to be supported by a broadened and improved distribution model for Internet. You'll have seen and Brad commented that this week we brought Loblaws mobile shop, they've been a fantastic partner for us on our Wireless business in recent years. They've been a fantastic supporter of Shaw Mobile since its launch in late July

And you can expect to see us continue to build on our third-party distribution capability for Internet this quarter as well as continuing to open more of our very effective and stunning new corporate stores, Shaw branded corporate stores in B.C. and Alberta, where we frankly lapped an appropriate retail presence in a lot of markets. We just haven't had been where people wanted to buy us. So those are all things that happen over time

Finally, we see the bundle here, Vince, as a really important part of our growth strategy. It has enormous potential to complement our Wireline profitable Internet business. But we face a competitor in TELUS, a very, very well-managed competitor, who continue to spend very aggressively to acquire customers in a mature market. You don't have to look too far to look to find a $500 Visa gift card for signing up to TELUS Internet bundle. You've heard me in the past, be very plain about our view on the level of swapping between the 2 companies in a mature market, and we continue to think that that's unnecessary and lost economic rent

So we -- as long as we face that economic pressure, those sort of acquisition pressures, we now have a tool in Shaw Mobile that we will deploy as necessary to meet our business objectives. You will have seen earlier this week we launched $25 unlimited plan. And we'll see how that goes. But know that we have our hands kind of firmly on the throttle. And as necessary, if we continue to see hundreds of dollars of investment from the other side of the house, we'll use those tools accordingly to make sure that we reach our numbers

So look, we have -- we operate in a market where our competitor has their bundle and we have ours. We prefer ours. We think mobile is a more compelling proposition from the consumer standpoint. And we'll see how it plays out over the next little while. I would not expect to see a dramatic turnaround in our numbers over the course of this quarter. It is a process, and it's going to take some time. It doesn't -- these things don't happen overnight. But I like the plan that we have. And we've been able to execute similarly in the Wireless business before

So I think there's some good lessons that we can bring from Wireless to Wireline here, and that process is underway. On your Wireless question, yes, we continue to see kind of a disappointing lack of discipline on Wireless competitive -- the Wireless competitive front. It feels like the market is chasing, frankly, at a pretty considerable expense, a very small pool of available growth

With less integration and the financial pressures in the economy right now, I think real growth is at a very, very modest level. And the promotional pricing you're seeing out there is intense. You'll have seen this week, that all 3 competitors now have what I'll loosely call an EPP, but I think we all know is broadly just an available plan that has 20 gigabytes out at $50, that was $180 18 months ago. We are the fourth player in the market. We have less than 20% of the subs of the big 3 each. We do not drive this ship. And if we're going to see that lack of discipline, it's -- I think any casual observer would come to the conclusion that you can't solve the service revenue problem, an ARPU problem by discounting at this level. Particularly when there's not a lot of market growth

So in the end, if we're going to see these bounties back and forth, as a new entrant with a smaller, less mature network, we're going to need to be priced below the incumbent. So there is a real risk that if this continues, it will drive us to price lower. I'm an optimist

So I'd like to think that the market pressure on service revenue growth will ultimately prevail here, but we'll have to see. In answer to your specific question, if a customer get back and forth to take advantage of a bounty, we count that as a negative gross add. It doesn't affect our overall churn. So the 10 basis point inflation in churn was related to the impact of this kind of activity and just the general macro competitive pressure

The next question comes from Drew McReynolds with RBC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - MD of Canadian Telecommunications &amp; Media Research and Analyst   [6]

Vince covered off a lot of my questions, maybe 2 or 3 follow-ups here. I think, first, from a CapEx standpoint, Trevor, you alluded to, obviously, a nice reduction in overall CapEx. I think it was $1.4 billion a few years ago, now $1 billion guided for this fiscal. Just can you comment on kind of the degree of sustainability of that level of CapEx, given both of your Wireless and Wireline segments

The second, maybe to you, Paul, on 5G. I think Brad just mentioned that, that will be kind of launched in market, I think it was said this year, I'm assuming that this fiscal year. Maybe comment on where Shaw is currently on that build-out? Are you still intending to be a fast follower as more and more 5G developments play out over the next few years

Lastly, on the operating environment, more on the B2B side, you do sound cautious. I think everybody is cautious out there. Maybe Trevor, could you provide what you're seeing as of today in terms of the trend from businesses, that would be helpful

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [7]

Yes. Sure, Drew, thanks for the questions, and I'll start on the CapEx sustainability. Obviously, you've seen our CapEx intensity moderate over the last few years, as you correctly point out. And again, most of that is frankly within Wireline. And I'd say a big part of that is just related to our transformation that we embarked on a number of years ago, and we see that as being very sustainable. I would say, the continued sort of slight decline this year versus F '20 in terms of what we guided towards, the majority of that is within Wireline again and again, self-install supports that. Our networks are in fabulous shape, our Wireline network

And I'd say, again, that is due to the significant investments that we've done over numerous years. We're going to continue to invest in the Wireline network as we need to. But again, that is moderating. We're sort of looking at more of 17%, 18% CapEx intensity going forward. On Wireless, we continue to make the right investments to improve the network and the customer experience in general. We look at that sort of bucket as being very stable this year versus last year, around the $300 million mark

And we don't see significant sort of forklift capital required in the future. I think we can really live within the roughly $1 billion sort of CapEx envelope to fund the investments that we need to drive this business going forward. So we're pretty confident, Drew, in that CapEx and that profile that we've got going forward, that of course, really supports a very, very attractive free cash flow profile as well

So we have a lot of conviction as a management team and the Board about the free cash flow profile of the company, which reflects a moderating capital intensity in the consolidated business. That being said, we're not starving the business of capital either. We're still spending roughly $1 billion. And we think that's the right envelope now and into the future

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [8]

Yes, Drew, on the 5G question, following on Brad's comments, we'll -- you can expect to see us live in the market in early calendar '21, so kind of in calendar early -- kind of mid-calendar Q1. And we're hugely optimistic and bullish on 5G's potential. I think you've seen from other operators and globally just the potential that this has

That said, in the short term, while we are essentially a fast follow simply because of the way that the spectrum auctions work and the fact that 600 hasn't been unpacked yet. We're excited about this, but I think in the short term, the voice of the customer is kind of what's really important here. We do extensive research, as you can imagine, about this. And while the industry is talking up 5G, I think, in a quite sensible way right now, there isn't really a compelling use case

Even -- we've done some research in the last number of weeks against in tenders for the Apple 5G iPhone. The people that are buying it from us tell us they want the new iPhone, but they're not really that interested in the 5G part of it because there's not a use case that's really driving that at this point. So that will happen and it will happen in time, and we will take advantage of that. I think the industry may want to reconsider how it monetizes that over time. We're kind of a little bit disappointed that at this point, the signal from the Canadian industry is that it will be not directly monetized, but sort of just moved up into specific rate card -- rate tiers. That's a strategy, I suppose. I'm not sure it's necessarily the best one

But over the early part of F '21, you'll see us fairly prominently in the 5G game. And until that time, we'll be able to service our customers with a fast LTE network, that is more than capable for the vast, vast mass majority of the uses that consumers are applying it to today. So excited about it long term. I think it's got great potential. We continue to believe it's going to open up all kinds of new doors for Shaw, particularly given some of our other relationships in Western Canada and what it might do for businesses. But at this point, we will be slightly behind the market in terms of timing, but not concerned about that delay

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [9]

And Drew, I think your third one was just on the overall sort of environment with respect to the SME and the business market here in Western Canada. And clearly, it's something that we're extremely proud of in terms of still delivering 2% growth during the last year. I think the teams led by Katherine Emberly did a fantastic job working individually with each one of our customers

We had a lot of customers in the spring that went on temporary. Suspension of services, a lot of those have come back. However, I'd say they've come back at reduced services, specifically within hospitality and the restaurant industry. They lit up their Internet service again, but their TV services and some of the others were maybe not to the same levels

Really, you can see from the revenue trajectory, it really has stabilized over the last couple of quarters. And there's still some uncertainty going forward through. It's -- the Western Canadian environment is -- still continues to be challenging. You've started to see some consolidation within the energy landscape recently. And I think most are anticipating that, that will increase. That being said, the teams have actually done a great job in terms of some additional sort of enterprise wins, new business

And the announcement yesterday, I think, around the tech deal is, again, another example of sort of these innovative solutions that we're providing to the business market. And also I'd just say, generally speaking, the disruptor, the value proposition that we're providing to small and medium businesses, we're pretty encouraged by the product suite that we have in front of us

We've launched some additional products that's really focused on helping businesses and their employees work from home. So there's puts and takes, but it's clearly something that we're very cautious on, Drew. It's one of those things, like, one of the reasons why we're not necessarily prepared to come up with more of a -- as prescriptive as guidance from an EBITDA perspective as we historically have

We've been generally growing that revenue on our business segment around 5% a year over the last number of years. This year was 2% because of the pandemic, and it's really tough to see where that's at, but we think we're doing the right thing for our business customers, and it has stabilized. So I don't want to scale investors, but it's really tough in terms of immediate line of sight on where things are going here

The next question comes from Jeff Fan with Scotiabank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Director of Telecommunication Services &amp; Canadian &amp; U.S. Telecom and Cable Equity Research Analyst   [11]

A bigger picture question for Brad, perhaps to start, and then I'll ask the others as well. The big picture question is, I guess, over the last few months since we spoke last quarter, there's been more news about the potential for cable consolidation here in Canada. So, Brad, wondering if you have any kind of high-level comments that you want to make about cable M&amp;As in Canada and what role potentially Shaw will play in that

And then the other question is just on the Wireless growth as we look out to '21 and perhaps even beyond. And this is probably a question for Paul. In light of the competitive landscape that you talked about in light of the Shaw Mobile launch, do you see a bit of a shift in terms of how service revenue growth, Wireless service revenue growth looks and the contributors to that, i.e., like subscriber growth versus ARPU growth?
 You guys have done a good job of growing ARPU in the last couple of years. Wondering if there's a shift there in terms of a greater focus on driving subscriber growth, especially if this environment kind of continues? And also, like in light of that, can you still grow EBITDA and margin if ARPU growth slows down?

Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive Chair &amp; CEO   [12]

Jeff, it's Brad. Thanks for the question. I kind of expected something like that would come on this call. Just a couple of things. Certainly, as a family, we're very committed to the long-term strategy at Shaw. We have a solid strategic plan. We're delivering on our commitments. We have substantial and growing free cash flow. And I think when you look at the balance sheet and be a financial position, right, with strong liquidity tied to that. And I just -- when I look kind of going where we're going from here, and we just launched Shaw Mobile and truly believe we have some untapped growth opportunity realized both on the consumer side and then eventually on the business side, which also includes, of course, a 5G service

And then I just -- I think about just the technology and the partnerships we have with Comcast and which really allows an enhanced video and broadband services. And finally, I would just say, 50 years in business as a company, we're very proud of our legacy of serving our customers and our communities over that period of time. And we're pretty comfortable where we stand now with where Shaw looks and are comfortable in that position

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [13]

Jeff, on your Wireless question, which was quite broad. So if you just indulge in a moment. We've been clear for my time here over the last 3 years that we look to grow our Wireless subscriber base by something in the range of 0.25 million subscribers a year. And we will continue to reiterate our expectation that we will grow our Wireless subscriber base by 0.25 million subscribers a year. So just in case that's unclear to anybody on the call. The means by which we'll get that may change over time

And you'll certainly see, for example, the stronger bias to Western Canada than we would have had in the past. And we signal that some time ago, historically, Western Canada has been about 1/3 -- 30% to 33% of our gross adds. That number is clearly shifting upwards with our new priority on Shaw Mobile. And ARPU, and this is probably a longer conversation for another day, but ARPU will, of course, start to moderate as a result of lower revenue Shaw Mobile customers, but of course, there's a value trade there with the Wireline side

So even if you look at the move we made earlier this week, it's $140 plus for our customers to buy that $25 plan on our Gig. So it's going to -- that will have a dilutive effect on ARPU, but it will have a materially positive effect at the residential level for Shaw. So we may be prepared or are prepared to trade some of those traditional metrics in a way that enhances value for the organization. So I think there's going to be some kind of reporting things. We'll have to get to probably next fiscal, then may change that

But just as you start to watch our metrics, know that there's going to be some impact from that over the next little while. I'm thrilled with how well ARPU performed. I think we were nicely above consensus on the [beat] this quarter. And certainly, the more successful we are on -- in kind of Western Canada, you'll start to see those numbers moderate. We are definitely seeing impairment, not to the same extent of the big 3, but we're seeing impairment that looks semipermanent on roaming. (inaudible) was a larger -- rather a smaller percentage of our overall ARPU, but that's difficult to replace

And it's certainly difficult to replace against the backdrop of the Wireless intensity that we're seeing. So my earlier comment about my optimism was driven by the fact that I think it's hurting the other guys worse than us. And if you are a believer in how well managed this category has been and I am over the years, you'd like to think that kind of greater sense prevails. Maybe it's worth observing that for a long time, these have been growth businesses for the big 3 and right now, they're just not growth businesses, not really on a net basis. There's a lot of stuff kind of buried in the numbers as we all know in terms of new subscribers

And maybe they need to be managed more like a mature business than a growth business. And if that was the case, then I think we probably stopped doing stuff like 20 Gig for $50 and chasing the other around -- around the market. So I'd like to think that MRC is going to be a bigger contributor to ARPU than it has been in the past. It's going to need to be if overages are gone, if roaming is impaired, and those look like, unfortunately, longer-term propositions at this point

So we remain enormously bullish on our Wireless business. We continue to believe that our growth aspirations are manageable and achievable. But we are at the whip end of the market on a lot of things here, right? We're a small player, and we don't dictate the terms of market conditions. So maybe a question you need to ask some other folks over the coming weeks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [14]

The next question comes from Aravinda Galappatthige with Canaccord

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Suranimala Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD   [15]

A couple from me. First of all, I think you alluded to sort of the Teck deal that you announced, I think, yesterday. I wanted to kind of build a little bit on that and get your thoughts on that sort of product line, particularly in terms of economics as well as sort of the runway to kind of expand in that particular area, private networks is getting more and more popular. So wanted to get your thoughts on that and perhaps any kind of capital commitments that you'd have to employ to further that area

And secondly, on bad debt provisioning, I wanted to get a sense of what you're seeing in terms of collections? Is there any sort of variances that should be highlighted? And a quick follow-up on the Internet net adds. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the retention aspect. I mean it sounds like it's mostly gross adds, but just on the retention aspect at the high end where there was, there continues to be sort of a more meaningful differential in pricing. I'll leave it there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [16]

Thanks, Aravinda. It's Paul. I'll take the first one and the third one, and Trevor will take the second one. Yes, I'm thrilled with the Teck deal, and Katherine and the team, I think, did a great job of bringing up to market, really a first of its kind private LTE deal in this country. And we think the first of a number that we'll look to announce over the course of the coming quarters. This is a decent-sized opportunity and really a great spark. It's a great indication of the fact that there's still life in the resource sector in Western Canada in a lot of regards

We are seeing a lot of interest on deals like this, there's been inbound even since the release. And the team continue to work that file. It is very efficient for us. It's one of those sort of wonderful opportunities of -- that's not spectrum that would have typically been deployed in any residential or consumer way. The fact that we're able to deploy it in a manner that is so useful for those companies is really, really exciting, and it does kind of signal a new opportunity just broadly for our Wireless business

The CapEx side of it is actually quite efficient. Oftentimes, we're able to work the cost of that right into the deal. And this is typically equipment that is owned and operated by the company themselves or third parties that they brought in on their behalf. So it's quite efficient from a CapEx standpoint, and we are expecting to see more progress here over the coming quarters, but great work from the team there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [17]

Yes. Let's say they're sort of -- generally speaking, there have been a long-tenured deals as well. So there's -- but to Paul's point, each deal is somewhat unique from a capital perspective, but most of that is generally covered by the customer. From a bad debt perspective and just collections in general, I'd say we continue to be extremely pleased from the payment history, both on the Wireline and the Wireless customers over the last number of months or 8 months since COVID-19 came about

There hasn't been any significant material issues that we've had to deal with. We're watching it on a daily basis. If you remember, Aravinda, we took about a $5 million charge last quarter related to bad debt across the enterprise. We did take some incremental expense related to bad debt in Q4. However, I would say it was fairly immaterial and was less than the charge that we took in Q3. So overall, we think we've provisioned it appropriately. It's less than about $10 million, just around $10 million, a little bit less for the year

And again, we're very, very, very pleased with the payment of all of our customers. And I think it goes to value proposition, specifically on the Wireless side in terms of the average ARPU, just over $40 and the utility that we're providing to customers in their home and to businesses, they are paying their bills, and we're watching it closely. But it's clearly a risk going forward, Aravinda, and we'll update you and the entire street if there's material changes. But as we sit right now, here at October 30, we feel like we're in good shape

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [18]

And Aravinda, back to me on your question about retention on Internet, and I'll maybe answer it a couple of different ways. We -- for a number of years, we were, frankly, losing ground to tell us in terms of the way the customers perceived our Wireline network, specifically the Internet product, and the launch of Fiber+ and our new rate plans back in May has very quickly started to turn that around

So while I acknowledge the softness in Internet net adds in the quarter, I would draw your attention to the fact that we also had significantly better than expected contribution from that line of business as well. So we focused a little more on quality during the quarter while we were rebuilding that game plan that I spoke to earlier. And one of the things that has been a nice outcome is that we have started our 715 gig speed tiers, have started to appeal to part of the market that we were previously losing on a pretty much exclusive basis to TELUS. Those more affluent families, those folks that are looking to just simply improve and harden the network quality within their residents really are now provided with a choice in the market where previously there wasn't one

And we're seeing a nice uptick in our shift in demographics in terms of who's now buying that product. So encouraging signs on that front as we kind of move up into the right on the speed tiers. And then just on a separate related comment on retention, I'd also tell you that while it's early, Shaw Mobile is, by definition, a tool designed to secure and entrench our relationship with our existing Wireline subscribers. So by definition, to be a Shaw Mobile customer, you need to be a Shaw Internet -- qualifying Shaw Internet customer

So as we grow that market over the course of the coming quarters, we will essentially introduce into the math a cohort of subscribers who are essentially very, very well secured and very well protected from competitive offers, and we essentially fall out of the denominator of potential churners. So while it's early, we're starting to see some nice security on that front. And again, as designed, Shaw Mobile is there to protect and cover our Internet base higher-margin product side

Your next question comes from Tim Casey with BMO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Equity Research Analyst   [20]

A couple for me. Paul, I'm wondering if you could expand upon your comments about your concern regarding the monetization model for 5G that you see out there. What kind of model would you be supportive of or aspire to with respect to that? And maybe if you can talk about how you're monetizing the private network model with Teck as (inaudible) foray into that?
 And the other question was, could you talk a little bit about your digital onboarding ability in Wireless? Reduced foot traffic, those type of things, obviously, would hinder a traditional retail distribution model. Just wondering if you can give any stats on how you're progressing with respect to onboarding people without the traditional model, be it a hybrid model or a pure online onboarding model?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [21]

Yes, certainly. Thanks, Tim. Thanks for those. Yes, the comment about 5G monetization was more a reflection that I was hoping that the industry didn't simply absorb the cost -- the incremental costs of that 5G spectrum and build out into a declining pricing environment. And I appreciate that initially there was a signal from the market that it would be temporarily suspended and then monetized to some incremental degree, perhaps $10 or $15 more for those faster rate plans

And it looks like the market's kind of come off that. And now we're simply saying we're just going to -- as long as you're on a certain level of plan, we will include 5G. It's -- I would have liked to have seen a little more of a consumer test there and to see whether or not there was a capacity and willingness to pay for that. Anybody that operates in Toronto and drives along the toll road, that is the 407, knows that sometimes you pay for faster lanes and you're willing to do so

There would have been nice if there was an opportunity to kind of test that, and I'm not sure that we're going to get that opportunity. So the risk here is that we spend billions of dollars on spectrum and build-out and simply just absorb it all. So from my standpoint, I would have preferred to see something that maybe look a little bit like the 3G LTE pricing back in the day where it was bit of a step-up to the higher speed

But again, we're not the driver of that particular pricing strategy. So we will probably be the kind of the price taker on that front once the market decides where it's going to net out. On the private LTE deal, where the terms of those deals are, as you imagine, are confidential, but suffice it to say that we, as Trevor pointed out, these are long-term deals that are -- because they're built into these facilities are very, very secure, essentially no churn and very, very encouraging kind of from a pricing standpoint

So we like the partnerships there. Digital onboarding, I would characterize us as being somewhat behind the industry, but I'll kind of charter -- we will fill in the blanks on the why. When we look at our Wireless business today, which has been historically 70% in Ontario, we compete against operators there, specifically Rogers and Bell, who have had the opportunity to curate their residential partners or residential customers for credit. So really, a lot of what they -- when they talk about kind of clicks and bricks, I think they're often talking about really hybrid of recognizing that they know the creditworthiness of a lot of these households because of their Wireline relationship, and then able to sort of manage them accordingly

So today, in Ontario, for example, if someone wanted to buy a new iPhone 12 and gave me their address in Oshawa, we would have a really difficult time determining whether that household was sufficiently creditworthy and kind of trustworthy from a fraud risk standpoint, because I think we don't have any other relationship with them. Rogers or Bell, if they have a payment history with them on that home for the last 3 or 5 or 10 years, is in a much better position to establish whether or not that's a risk they can take. We -- so I think on Wireless in Ontario, they have an advantage there that is probably structurally permanent relative to us

In the western part of the country, we've been busy working with our finance colleagues to develop exactly the same capabilities. And to make sure that our data analytics and our digital capabilities are one of our top development priorities. I'd say we're rapidly closing the gaps that exist between ourselves and the incumbents, but I'm quite comfortable saying that this is an area where we have lagged

Frankly, having been the owner of this Wireless business for 4 years now, most of our priority early on, Tim, was making sure that we brought our network quality and distribution up to speed. And these are some of the things that lapped. It would have been nice to have been more on top of the digital capabilities and I'll take responsibility for not having done that over the last couple of years because I was in the seat

But it is something that we're now quickly bringing things up to speed on. One of the reasons I'm so excited about having partnerships for Wireless in the West that look like Walmart and Loblaws is because regardless of what might happen in traditional malls, a good friend of mine says people still need to eat

So we will continue to see traffic, considerable traffic in Loblaws and Walmart's retail footprint here in Western Canada. And because of the strength of our partnership with them on the Wireless front, we'll continue to have opportunities there as well. So expect us to get better at digital, recognize that we probably have a structural disadvantage in Ontario and in the West, we will then have a structural advantage

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Equity Research Analyst   [22]

If I could just squeeze one follow-up in. Regarding Internet loading, and the aspiration you had set out earlier this year to get more of your fair share of net loading in Western Canada, do you think that's an achievable target for fiscal '21? Or are we more likely to see something trending to that in '22 or '23?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [23]

Yes. There's nothing like someone bringing back your first comment from being in the new job. Thanks for that, Tim. We -- I have enormous aspiration and confidence in our team that we'll be able to get our fair share. Let me maybe take this opportunity to redefine fair share. It's a tricky piece of evaluation, and we had this conversation yesterday with our Board around what is actually in the denominator for ourselves and tell us when we report

And without trying to sound like I'm hedging on this, one of the things we struggled with here is the lack of transparency, probably from both organizations on what's in Internet net adds, is difficult to make an apples-to-apples comparison. So I don't think there's any debate that we have been in a losing position on market share over the course of the last number of years. But what I want to make sure we do as accurately as possible is not over or underreact to competitive moves that we may not necessarily have even an opportunity of sharing

So I'll use, for example, the market of [golden out] here where a large ski community that is covered by TELUS' wireless network but not really doesn't have much of a wireline presence for anybody. And TELUS have a very strong presence for their wireless hub product, which I believe gets reported as an Internet net add in which we have absolutely no ability to have any market share there because we don't have deployed spectrum in that market

So that likely counts in their net adds. There is the Internet for Good program, which they've been very aggressive with during COVID, which is obviously a very low revenue piece of the pie. Our aspiration here, Tim, to be clear, is to ensure that we get our fair share where we compete. And I should have been more specific about that when I talked about it in April. So I'll clean that up now. But where we have facilities and where we compete against tell us, that's what we're looking to get our fair share of

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Equity Research Analyst   [24]

Can you put a parameter on that? How much of your footprint would you say you have the ability to compete?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [25]

Well, honestly, Tim, we're doing that analysis now. Our -- and when you think about fixed wireless, for example, that's an example -- we have probably somewhere between 200,300 thousand households in Western Canada where we have wireless coverage but not wireline coverage. I suspect that number is significantly higher for TELUS. That's where we're doing that math now. But it's probably going to have to wait for the next call for me to give you a more thorough answer on that one

Operator   [26]

The next question comes from David McFadgen with Cormark Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David John McFadgen,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Director of Institutional Equity Research   [27]

A couple of questions on Shaw Mobile. I don't know if you can provide us with these data points, but that would be helpful. I was wondering if you could tell us what percentage of your net adds were actually Shaw Mobile in the quarter. And then of those Shaw Mobile net adds, what percent are taking the bundle? I would imagine, it's probably 100% or close to 100%

And then lastly, when you look at the Internet performance in the quarter, has Shaw Mobile delivered any brand-new Internet customers for you? Or is it just too early because it just launched and all the Shaw Mobile customers are pre-existing Shaw Internet customers?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [28]

Good question. Thanks, David. Yes, in order consistent with what the treatment that the incumbents used for delineating between brands, we won't be breaking out Shaw Mobile versus Freedom brand at any more than the others do between their flanker/fighter and primary brands. So that -- just going forward, you won't see us break that out at any point. It is, if you'll recall, we launched on July 30

So we only had a month of that activity within the year's numbers. So (inaudible) quarter's number, so you can kind of get a sense of how that may have impacted the quarter. You're correct, 100% of the people that are on Shaw Mobile are in the bundle. So again, today, a qualifying event for Shaw Mobile is that you need to be within one of the applicable Internet plans. And to be clear, if you were to remove yourself from that Internet plan, your pricing changes on Shaw Mobile. So there is essentially a reward for staying within that bundle

And so far, we've seen essentially everybody stay within it. So the churn on that group is exceedingly low during the quarter. And then -- sorry, the third question was on new subscribers, new Internet subscribers. Yes, fundamentally, the early appeal of this, which you won't be surprised that reward disproportionately people that take our higher-value plans, that will have a higher pull-through of competitive users, I suspect

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David William Barden,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - MD   [29]

Okay. And then maybe if I can just have one follow-up. Did you see any discernible negative impact of Freedom from the [wins] of Shaw Mobile in the marketplace?

Paul McAleese,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [30]

I wouldn't call any of it negative. There is certainly a small degree of brand migrations, which we are very comfortable with. So we do have people that are on Freedom who may also be a Shaw customer, and we were very prepared and quite happy with them coming over locking -- moving from Freedom mobile over to Shaw and locking into the bundle. We love that value trade. And if we can secure that, we'll take that all day long. It's a relatively small percentage, though, David. So I wouldn't characterize it as something that's going to have an impact on any of the Freedom metrics

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [31]

This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the call back over to Mr. Shaw for his closing remarks

Questions and Answers

Samuel D. Bush,  Saga Communications, Inc. - Senior VP, Treasurer &amp; CFO   [1]

Yes, we do. We have 2 questions today

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Edward K. Christian,  Saga Communications, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Chairman   [2]

That's nice. That's nice

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Samuel D. Bush,  Saga Communications, Inc. - Senior VP, Treasurer &amp; CFO   [3]

It is, it is. Somebody cares

The first question is..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Edward K. Christian,  Saga Communications, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Chairman   [4]

Only 2 people care, I guess

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Samuel D. Bush,  Saga Communications, Inc. - Senior VP, Treasurer &amp; CFO   [5]

The first question is, do you see a stabilization of revenue or a continuing downward trend or what?

Edward K. Christian,  Saga Communications, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Chairman   [6]

Well, that's a good open-ended question. It depends. And that's not a ducking answer. But let me just share some information. And like any good scout, I always keep my ear down to the railroad track. So I can tell when the trains are coming. And that's an old thing I don't really put my ear to the track, Sam, just so you get that straight. What I'm hearing is in the larger markets, the top 10, top 25, whatever it is. There is a fear that they have reached a new norm, which in the larger markets is running like minus 20 from comparable years. And the fear is that this is going to be where they are. And for several months, they've kind of hung in there, and they're not seeing minus 15, minus whatever it is. In the secondary markets where we operate, we do have some -- we are not in the top 25, but I think 7% of our stations are in the top 50 or 25 to 50, whatever it is. It's more down in the lower teens, 12%, 14% and holding kind of right there for now

Now, is that going to change? Well, that all depends. It depends on where the economy goes and everything else. But it seems that the larger markets are getting hit harder than the secondary markets where you have more ball control over what you do in terms of sales where you can be creative. And you have a smaller universe to play in, but a bigger playing field within that universe itself. So do I see anything catastrophic coming up? No. But that could change tomorrow. That's asking me to look into some sort of magic ball and figure that out or do it in the (inaudible) board like we did years ago

That if we get down to 12%, and that becomes a new normal for a while, we're okay. Because we have made, as you noted, and they're without giving exact figures. We have reduced our overhead substantially without impacting the effect of our organization. We've had no risk to speak up. We don't go in there with wholesale laying off of people and announcing a 40 or 50 people are gone. That hasn't happened with us. We have crafted surgically, literally, a pass that reduces expenses that holds us there. So we're good. But the question is, is it 20%? Is it 12%? It depends on the marketplace. It depends on the size of the market, and it depends on the station itself. So it's a very hard question to answer. Am I optimistic? Yes. Do I think that we're going to be right back to where we were last year? No

I think 2021 is going to be another slagging year as long as the economy keeps some momentum moving forward. And it's not a quick turnaround is other issues

Okay. That's my answer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Samuel D. Bush,  Saga Communications, Inc. - Senior VP, Treasurer &amp; CFO   [7]

Very good. And the second question is, Nielsen has made a policy change under which it will no longer include the ratings for nonsubscribing radio stations in the summary data set that fuels the major buying systems used by agencies and advertisers. What revenue impact do you expect the policy change to have in Saga's markets where it doesn't subscribe to Nielsen ratings?

Edward K. Christian,  Saga Communications, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Chairman   [8]

Well, okay. Good question, actually. It's the hot topic in the industry right now. I presume that, that's written by when the question comes in from one of the trades. I won't ask you then. We don't discuss that

Well, what I mean by first saying, there is no secret to this. And Saga is not a client of Nielsen. And so therefore, what I'm saying is not based on a client relationship with the Nielsen company. Let me explain to some of those who don't understand exactly what's going on here. Nielsen surveys 2 different sets of markets. One is the diary market, which is, in my opinion, a highly automated way of surveying, where you're asking a responder to carry personally a diary for 7 days and contemporaneously fill out line-by-line what he listens to, what radio station, what time it starts, what time it ends. And well, I'll give you an example on this. Because this will take a few minutes to answer. When I was an adjunct professor at Central Eastern University, one of the lectures that I did was with grad students. When talking about statistics and ratings and (inaudible) in broadcasting, radio and television, but primarily radio with that case. And we would sit down and I would say to them, and I had from Nielsen in that time diaries, they punch holes in them so they can't be used. And I pass them out to the -- it was like 15 grad students in the class

Past month, each one of them have looked at the kind of strange. So nicely explained to them. You're right now expected to, as a class exercise, carry this for a week and contemporaneously record your radio listening. These are, again, grad students, so we weren't talking about freshman or anything like that. Contemporaneously record your radio listening for 7 days and then mail diary back. And by the way, for this -- doing this and keeping this, I will give you a 6 pack of PBR, which at that time was about $5, which is what Nielsen has raised is what they pay. And I submit to you that, that was flying back 40 years ago when it was a proud thing to be a Nielsen to Emily or whatever it might be, and we have a responsibility to fill out on recording with that, but that doesn't happen now

So that's part of -- and the other one is the PPM, which is the meters that are attached to people's belts and it warrants for up to 2 years for listening. When they gather this information then and put it out and in the PPM form, there's plus or minus 2 standard deviations of the norm involved. So if you chose that you have an 8 share, you could have a 6 share or a 10 share, either one of them is statistically accurate. When they send this information out, people -- radio stations subscribe "to the information" and the same with the people meter, they subscribe for the information. It then is also sold to the advertising agencies at a highly discounted rate compared to what stations pay. And what they are doing now with this new proposal they've come in. And by the way, this has been creeping up because each -- several years, they cut out another feature punishing nonsubscribers like us. I won't say punishing but changing to benefit subscribers. And now there's -- the agency has got 2 levels of information, summary data and respondent data

Now the summary data is, basically, you get the information, you feed it into a strata computer, and it shows you exactly what the market looks like so that you can determine your buying

Now the summary data, which is what, 30? I don't know what percentage, but not all their subscribers. This is the basic one. And I think there's 65 -- they say 65% in one of their releases. 35%, we get the other, and I'll get to that in a second. But 35% get the summary data or vice versa, whichever it might be. I'm sorry, I'm not quite clear on that. If they get that, the summary data, they can put it in and see the entire market and make their buy at the agency level

By the way, I must say this is a terrible disservice to the advertising agencies by eliminating this. This, in many respects, invalidates the whole thing. On the last, you decide now that the summary data, which is most popular, is to be replaced by the respondent level data, which is more information than the agencies really need and therefore, really don't buy it. Because it's got ZIP code analysis and a lot of things that gets into -- very granular things for the meter and eventually for PPM acknowledgment

What Nielsen is doing is essentially increasing the rates by 50% or more to the individual agencies that subscribe to just the summary data. If you want the respondent data, in other words, eventually, the summary data will not be able to be used as buying service because by -- because it doesn't show the entire radio market. The number of AM radio stations that are there are probably going to go away or any of the secondary stations. However, as a kind of benevolent gesture, Nielsen is keeping the public radio stations in there, and I don't believe charging that much at all

Now for years, they wouldn't show up on NPR because they didn't consider them real forces in the advertising market. Now they do. But with this said, what happens is that every agency that has a conscience in terms of being responsible as buying service for the clients has to pay at least 50% more to get the respondent level data. And then because -- otherwise, you can't even manually enter it really. And you have to use Tapscan, which is a company that's owned by Nielsen. So that could be more. I'm not sure if that there's a thing on this. But Nielsen is blaming the radio stations, well, any station that doesn't subscribe shouldn't be shown. The agency shouldn't -- nobody exists unless you pay us 50% more and then you can see it. So it's unfair to blame the radio stations. We have enough relationship issues with Nielsen without pointing a finger and saying, bad dog, bad dog. And that's what's happening on this. I'm taking way too long to answer the question, and I really should kind of shut up on this

And I would be glad to discuss this with anybody that wants to know about it, wants to hear about the media rating console and how many markets they don't have in the PPM thing certified by MRC or the efficacy of the diary method or the way that they're approaching agencies, trying to put the blame for them forcing the agencies to pay more to get the same product they had with a summary level data

And I'll close yourself with the quote that I read this morning and another trade sheet right now from Jerry del Colliano. And Jerry's trade sheet this morning said, it's like doing a census, but not including the people who don't pay their taxes to Cesar as if they didn't exist. And this is essentially what is occurring here with Nielsen. Like it or don't. And I'm sure they're sitting there rumbling at me now for my diatribe. But all I want is honesty, and I want to have a level-playing field for everybody to going to show radio stations, and you're going to measure correctly and properly, and that leave out, in some cases, 40% of the radio market because they don't subscribe your service, that's punitive. And that just almost mean spirited in some respects. Have I said too much, Sam?

Samuel D. Bush,  Saga Communications, Inc. - Senior VP, Treasurer &amp; CFO   [9]

No, I think you've covered, and you certainly have said what you feel, as you always do, which is great

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Edward K. Christian,  Saga Communications, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Chairman   [10]

No, it's all logic

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Samuel D. Bush,  Saga Communications, Inc. - Senior VP, Treasurer &amp; CFO   [11]

It is, totally

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Edward K. Christian,  Saga Communications, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Chairman   [12]

It is what it is. And nobody is taking the thing, they're being powered into, well, maybe we're better radio stations. You're not. Like us, we have the relationships with our clients one-on-one. They know what we can do in the community. And this is something that Nielsen has a little problem understanding is that radio stations can be successful through one-on-one client relationships because they can see and feel and touch and believe what happens in the community. I'm done. Okay

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Samuel D. Bush,  Saga Communications, Inc. - Senior VP, Treasurer &amp; CFO   [13]

Absolutely, when somebody walks in their store and buys, they know why it's there, is why local direct is doing what it's doing, which is terrific

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Edward K. Christian,  Saga Communications, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Chairman   [14]

It works. Do I have time for one more quick story? In our -- the retraining of salespeople, our new salespeople. One of the things that we have kind of mandated is that you can't sell short. Everything has got to be long on it. And so one of the new salespeople went out there in one of the markets, and I'm not going to do who or where. But why don't and was trained, went through all the certification. And she was out calling out an HVAC dealer. This is a category we've really started working very heavily to get HVAC companies in. Because in a depressed economy or an under economy, if your air-conditioning or heater goes out, you need to call somebody. So she sat down and did the presentation to the owner of the HVAC location and went through it all. And he finally said, okay, yes, I think I'm trying radio. I know. Let's do it for 3 weeks. She said, sir, I'm sorry, I can't sell you 3 weeks. He said, fine. She said, no, sir, I would -- I can't -- our minimum at the radio station, it's 12 weeks. Because if we sold just 3 weeks, we wouldn't be doing you any good. Because there's not enough repetitions. There's not enough imaging, there's not enough chance for us for brand building and everything else like this. Finally, the guy said, okay, I'll take 12 weeks. Under the old school of thinking in a radio, the salespeople would come in and say, hey, I just scored so and so for 3 weeks for a new advertising. No. We're going in to prove the radio works and we do it for 12 weeks. That's where we get the results and get the returns from people. So now I can shut up and say, Catherine, please sign me off. Okay

With the CapEx increase of 50 million or so, you said that there's some acceleration of facilities projects. So, if there is an acceleration, does that imply we're basically taking some CapEx from '09 and bringing it forward into 2008, and therefore, we could see a drop in spending in '09?

I think it's a couple of things. Peter, or Brad, if we go over the node segmentation to keep our performance high, we have split more nodes this year than we ever have in the past. Is that right, Peter?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - President   [4]

Absolutely, Jim. And with regards to facilities, we have acquired a piece of property that will actually occur this quarter. And so you'll see that reflected in this quarter's results. We've also been accelerating node segmentations. We've been initiating a project which would see us consolidate as many of our smaller head-ends as possible. And in order to do that, capital is required for the placement of fiber optic cable and, of course, new equipment in these consolidated head-ends

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - Vice Chairman and CEO   [5]

Brad, we consolidated how many head-ends this quarter?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP of Operations   [6]

Approximately six

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - Vice Chairman and CEO   [7]

And we're on track to do probably another six or eight over the balance of the year?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP of Operations   [8]

Yes, we are. It will actually continue throughout -- into next year as well, Jim, as the fiber is placed, and we extend -- we actually complete those head-end relocations. So, the benefit of doing this is that when we make changes to our channel lineups, or we add high-definition channels, rather than having to put equipment into 100 or so head-ends, we're able to do that in a smaller number, approximately five or six consolidated head-ends across Western Canada

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [9]

That all sounds like those are good projects. I'm just curious, looking a little bit longer-term, some of your peers are saying that CapEx should migrate down to 18 to 20% of revenue over time; I believe that's what Comcast is targeting this year as well. Do you see a similar trend after you get over some of these lumpy projects?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CFO   [10]

Vince, one of the things, as you know, that we've tried to do in building our longer-range plan is to make sure that we maintain CapEx as even as possible, and not have big swings up and down. So our plan, as Peter said, for node segmentation and for improvements in the network, have taken that into account to try and level that out. The facilities purchase that we're talking about, which we'll close this quarter, is approximately $50 million. And you'll see that in the coming quarter's MD&amp;A. It's an opportunity for us to create a campus environment here in Alberta, and move and consolidate some of our operations in a more streamlined fashion, and also to allow us to accommodate further growth as well in an efficient and streamlined fashion. So that's one of the big impacts that has affected the capital number for this year. So it's not a number of little [ones and twos]; that's a significant project in and of itself

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - Vice Chairman and CEO   [11]

I think, Vince, if we look at it -- and I'm going to ask Brad to comment on this -- we're trying to keep our capital balanced so it kind of maintains a certain level rather than have a big up and a big down. Like the launch we were just working with Time Warner Telecom; we were down to see them last week, and working on a whole bunch of stuff with Level 3 to now facilitate the Shaw business phone environment, which we have integrated now with the cable operation across the board. Right, Brad?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP of Operations   [12]

Right, Jim. And we've seen -- we continue to see benefits and we continue -- as we integrate and look for synergies within the groups, and driving it through cable as we've had a lot of success, we're certainly going to see that grow. We're really preliminary with Time Warner stuff, but we're looking at opportunities where on the business side we can do deals (inaudible) fulfillment

Rob Goff, Haywood Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Haywood Securities - Analyst   [14]

Would you say that your growth was at all gated by your availability of labor? And as a second question, is there one contributor to your [RDU] growth where you see a greater opportunity to push?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - Vice Chairman and CEO   [15]

Brad, why don't you push on that. You've got the biggest group

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP of Operations   [16]

As far as labor goes, we've had some success in certain markets ensuring that we have the labor force in place to grow the business. We still have certain challenges, such as in Alberta. But as we've -- we had a little Internet slowing down, we've been able to move some resources around within the groups to make sure we deliver on the growth targets. So, the labor is still a challenge, but we've been able to manage and we'll continue to do that. The second question?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - President   [17]

Some of the growth actually came through the Christmas period on our digital -- where there were more high-definition television sets sold through that period through retail than we have experienced in the past. And we were delighted to be able to provide high-definition PVRs to those customers who bought those high-definition boxes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP of Operations   [18]

We saw a [68]% increase in the quarter for digital set-top box through third party, and we've had -- with the digital phone growth, it's been launched in new areas. We've launched new product offerings into Shaw digital phone that has slowed down churn as we address more of the full base of market. And going forward, we had a record quarter, and we see that somewhat slowing down into what we've always said, that 40, 45 range. And we see that going forward. And the digital set-top, Q2 has always been our strongest quarter retail Christmas, and as Peter mentioned (inaudible) TVs still coming down in cost and are -- and the cost of set-tops. So we saw a very strong quarter. But going forward, we could see that slowing down a bit

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - Vice Chairman and CEO   [19]

And I think, Rob, the last thing I would just like to throw in there is that we, even though we're having labor issues, we have not seen a benefit by us really charging into the labor market even harder trying to bring people on and not achieving our goals. So, we're pretty comfortable kind of maintaining or adding a little bit to the level we're at. And as you know, we've got a lot of people cycling through with 10,000 employees. So we've got a fair amount of turnover, so we're pretty comfortable at this level, and feel we can manage it and get some really decent growth

Jeff Fan, UBS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  UBS - Analyst   [21]

First, on the satellite business, it looks like the price increases you guys implemented early in the year, in the calendar year, helped. But if we look at the, I guess, improvement in the operating profit line for satellite, can you talk a little bit about what else contributed to that improvement from what we saw in Q1? Second question, again on CapEx, I'm wondering if you can help give us some guidance to what was spent on the (technical difficulty) for CapEx this quarter, or so far this year, perhaps, for the first half?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CFO   [22]

Just repeat the second part of that question there on CapEx

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  UBS - Analyst   [23]

Just on CapEx for telephony, how much you spent on that in the first half of this year. And the last question is on HD again. Can you just review for us what your current HD lineup is, how many channels, what your plan is going forward, and, just big picture, how you plan to monetize that?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - Vice Chairman and CEO   [24]

Why don't we start with you on the satellite side, and then we'll kind of dig into the other guys

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Cummins,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - VP of Operations, Star Choice   [25]

The quarter was certainly very strong for us. Our customers are certainly enjoying the packages and the setup that we out up for HD. As you know in the press release, we actually surpassed our 200,000th HD customer, and they are certainly seeing value there. The $3 rate increase happened, actually, the revenue occurred for two months of the three months as of January. And we currently don't report churn, but I can tell you that it was positive, and certainly consistent, and our customers certainly continue to see value there. On the HD side, on the Star Choice side, we currently have 36 HD channels; 26 of those channels are in our no-additional-cost fee package. And we recently also through this quarter moved TSN and SportsnetHD into now our revenue generating package, with really little churn

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CFO   [26]

Jeff, we saw the margins in satellite go from 33.5 to just over 36, and that was the range we kind of talked about previously that we would be in, remembering that it doesn't take a lot to move those margins here. The price increase that Jim talked about for two months contributed about 1% increase in the margin quarter-over-quarter, and the reduced sales and marketing costs and the impact of the churn was pretty well the balance of it. So that's [likely] the range of where we are now, down to that lower level book where you'll see us [operating] going forward

In terms of the CapEx on phone, we've done about $45 million of CapEx on phone in the first half of the year, which brings us to about $290 million in total. And the phone business right now is performing very well for us; the margins are over 40%. And we're very pleased with how that is all running in line with some of the things we talked about two years ago this quarter when we first rolled it out

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  UBS - Analyst   [27]

One last thing, on the HD for the cable side. What's your offering now, and what do you plan to go to?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP of Operations   [28]

We have approximately -- just to give you an idea, we have an HD+ package that covers about 115,000 customers of our 270,000 HD customers, and they give us approximately $9 per month. We have two packages. One is a standard free package that comes with about six or eight channels of free HD, and the number we would have [in service would] be about 25 HD services. So the rest would be in the pay package. And we launched that a couple quarters ago, and we're seeing nice growth on the HD platform. Our focus would be to continue to make sure we try to get people into that package as we go forward and continue to grow the base of the box as it comes down in price

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  UBS - Analyst   [29]

I think one of the things that Brad and, of course, Peter and Jim are working on to a large degree is now this -- basically, we're going to have a block of buildings, and we're going to have kind of integrated call centers. So we're deploying some new latest-generation telephone software that the CSRs will be able to answer different calls around, and we think there's a lot of synergies we're going to be able to add to the operation as we develop. And sales, we're going to -- Peter, I always forget the name of that software, where it prompts you to ask for the order, and it prompts you -- so when your account comes up, it will tell the CSR instantly that you don't have HD, or you don't have digital phone. So we can prompt into these sales areas, and we think there is a huge gain to be had by the operation in doing that

Dvai Ghose, Genuity Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [31]

The first is on promotional activity. I understand that a second line home phone only costs $1.95 a month. That promotion, I think, was for the last two months of the quarter. So, to what extent did that boost the home phone numbers? What does that mean for home phone margins, because I presume you can't make a lot of margin at $1.95? And what do you think it means in terms of potential response from Telus and commitment to rational pricing?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - President   [32]

We haven't -- we're not aware of that promotion you just told us about, so that might be a telephone company's promotion

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [33]

It's on your Web site, I think

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - Vice Chairman and CEO   [34]

Let us look into that. I'm not totally sure. I know -- I thought we had something around $4, didn't we, Peter?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - President   [35]

I'm going to have to look at that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - Vice Chairman and CEO   [36]

We'll have to have a look. I just can't remember

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [37]

That's fair enough. Let me move on (multiple speakers)

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - President   [38]

You might be talking about a distinctive ring feature as opposed to a second line

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [39]

I can send you the link which shows $1.95 (multiple speakers). That's fine. The second one -- I understand you can't talk about the auction, but maybe I could ask you, without being too philosophical, this question. On the Cogeco call today, Louis Audet basically said that Canadian cable is growing very nicely today, but the growth is not sustainable. So he's prepared to see near-term dilution in order to expand growth by going to Europe. That's not your strategy. I'm wondering if you see any analogies with wireless. Are you prepared to sacrifice near-term cash flow growth in order to enhance longer-term growth by getting into wireless? Just a philosophical question, nothing specific with AWS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - Vice Chairman and CEO   [40]

Of course, you know we're not going to talk a lot about this, but the one thing we can say is that when Shaw deploys, we've been able to come up with a mixture for our consumers that has made pretty well every investor money across the board. And Shaw will not deploy if the economic model does not work in the long term. And when we see the economic model on wireless, it looks to us like it works. Of course, there's always a little bit of equipment issues that you have to deal with, as there was with digital phone. And for guys to come in and compete against us, like, let's say, MTS and other people, it's going to be really hard when we're offering a full suite of products for them to come in across the board. And as always with Shaw, it will be a slow and steady rollout. So we'll get to judge, as will you, as tracking the Company, get to judge how well we're doing. And certainly, Shaw would not put any capital at risk unless it saw an opportunity for its shareholders

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [41]

That makes good sense. I would love to follow-up on the promotional thing off-line because I'm just looking at your Web site now -- second line, $1.95 a month; distinctive ring that you were referring to, $3.95 per month each. If we can follow-up later on, that would be great

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [43]

First, Telus TV. They've stepped up their efforts in part of your market. We're not seeing the impact in your overall numbers. But you, obviously, see the numbers sort of market by market, so I'm wondering if you could comment a little bit on what you're seeing there. And secondly, if you could give us an update on what you're doing in the small to medium business effort with telephony and data. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - Vice Chairman and CEO   [44]

Brad, why don't you do that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP of Operations   [45]

Telus TV launched on mass market, print, radio and TV February 3rd (inaudible) Super Bowl, and they've continued that advertising right through. A bundled offer with a contract. Triple play $96. Of course there's a few limitations -- two TVs per household, only one HD as of this moment. Of course the free hardware is included. You require Telus' enhanced Internet. And what we've seen, there is still some small pockets in Edmonton that the service isn't available. They've only launched for one full month in Q2 '08, so we're still a little early on this on the full-scale market. But we haven't seen any significant impact to date. And at the end of the day overall, we're focused more on what we do and doing it well than what Telus is doing, but that's kind of where it is. And what we're seeing from a disconnect point of view is really between three markets -- Vancouver, Edmonton and Calgary. The numbers aren't significant. But, to give you a sense, the disconnects are maybe 40% Edmonton, and the other two would be both 30%

Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [46]

How would that run rate compare to where it was, say, prelaunch?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP of Operations   [47]

Of course that mix is changing a bit with Edmonton launching, but it's a little early for us to tell just how much that's changing. We're still seeing activity, but the activity is really minimal when you look at the overall base

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [48]

And no launches yet in your other markets. Am I right?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP of Operations   [49]

We think there might be something going on in Calgary here, but that's only just a couple days old. We need to do a little more work in just seeing what's going on. But we expect to launch Calgary, and then in a little while Vancouver. So we're just making sure all our ducks are in order

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - Vice Chairman and CEO   [50]

But I think, given our offering, Glen, that we're pretty comfortable that we are very competitive, and not that they won't be either. But, every service has a little bit of an anomaly to it. And the 40% number seems high, but that's of the total disconnects we had. Brad, didn't we see in Edmonton where they launched a big marketing campaign, and actually our adds picked up?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP of Operations   [51]

Yes. Good point, Jim. We had -- actually, prelaunch, we had more disconnects in Edmonton than postlaunch. And it is early, it's only a month, but that's just some preliminary information

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [52]

And you're still selling your set-tops at full price, and they're bundling them in -- is that right -- in that market?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP of Operations   [53]

That's correct

(OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). John Henderson, Scotia Capital

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Henderson,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [55]

A question on sort of the dividend, and wireless again. It's kind of like device -- just wondering how sacred the dividend is. If you see wireless as a great opportunity, is the dividend actually -- that's absolutely solid and going to stay as is?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - Vice Chairman and CEO   [56]

I think that's a pretty big board discussion. Steve can go through the numbers a little bit, John. But when you look at it, we've been able to maintain, grow, and have the free cash flow. So, even in let's take the worst-case scenario, which I don't think will happen at all, we're pretty able to fund the dividend and all the other stuff on a go-forward basis, and achieve the plan that we're kind of setting out for you, and the growth level we're talking about. Right, Steve?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CFO   [57]

Exactly

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - Vice Chairman and CEO   [58]

So we don't see a lot of risk in our management profile of where we're going here, and we don't think you should be that concerned about the dividend going away. Shaw likes the dividend. The Board is committed to delivering extra [cash] back to shareholders if there is some, and also growing the internal business

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CFO   [59]

Let me just add that we've come an awful long way in the dividend. Over the last month or so, we've been ranking in the top 10 of the TSX 60 in terms of dividend yield, the top 20 of the TSX 300 in dividend yield. Now, that may change a little bit with today's numbers, but a very solid, income-oriented investment for investors with the kind of growth potential you're seeing here as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Henderson,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [60]

Exactly. And I think this is just what those investors want to hear. Could I just get a clarification on the facilities purchase this quarter? That is not -- that is part of CapEx; it's not an acquisition?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CFO   [61]

It's part of CapEx. That's correct

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - Vice Chairman and CEO   [62]

That's correct. And also in that, too, John, we're going to -- you'll see us -- we're going to clean up a couple old properties. So the number that comes out won't be as large as it looks. I think it was -- it's around a $50 million purchase. But we're going to retain up, Steve, I don't know, 25 million of that out of existing buildings. So it's really just an integration of us trying to get all our operations working together under one umbrella

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Henderson,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [63]

Just one last one, on the Part II fee benefit. Is there -- can you give us any indication of when we might hear a decision on that?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CFO   [64]

We're not aware of any -- where that's going to be. It's before the courts right now, and it'll have to move forward before the courts. One of the things for the benefit of everybody in terms of understanding where that's at, we stopped accruing the Part II fee after the first month of the year, after the CRTC notice came out in October. So the impact to us in the year is about $2 million per month, or about 22 million year-over-year. And that we're tracking in our contingency (technical difficulty) the financial statement (inaudible). You can make your own decision in terms of Part II fees and the risk that those might be payable. But the number is there for you, and it's disclosed in the financial statement. So you can make that assessment yourself and determine what the [quantum] is

Peter MacDonald, GMP Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [66]

Just a couple of follow-ups on John's questions. That $22 million in fees, is that included in your free cash flow guidance number?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CFO   [67]

Yes it is. And that's included in the EBITDA as well, obviously

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [68]

The facility that you're acquiring, can you give us some indication of what that is? Is it just fiber, or --

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - President   [69]

No, it's a building. It's actually -- just to be clear, it's four buildings on a piece of property adjacent to an existing piece of property, which allows us to integrate all of our divisions working on that in a campus-like setting, which allows us to benefit from some of the economies of scale, some of the back-office systems, and also [attribute] to engagement of our employees

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [70]

And gives room for future growth as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [71]

Why does that come up as CapEx rather than as an investment?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CFO   [72]

We're buying it like we would buy any other facility. So, it's a CapEx item

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [2]

Thanks, good morning. Just if you could give us a bit of color on the competitive market, I know you spoke a bit about the TELUS TV launch in a few markets last quarter and obviously that has expanded. A mean your numbers obviously speak to that a great deal given the good subnumbers you have had for your products this quarter, but any anecdotal commentary as far as what environment you are facing, how much change in some markets just so we can sort of expand on that? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chair &amp; CEO   [3]

You want to go ahead, Brad?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Operations, Shaw Cablesystems   [4]

Sure. Bob, it is Brad here. Yes, you are right, we have seen -- from a TELUS point of view, they have launched through the quarter in the three big markets and we have seen them aggressively price the product at a discount of approximately 40% to 50% off our pricing. Listen, we are ready for that and we have done a lot of work on our save and win-back offers and continue to fight it out on a day-to-day basis with them. And from there, it is a little too early to say how that is all working and how that is all going to flesh out, but we are in definitely a competitive mode

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [5]

Does the new digital platform, the basic, does that play into that competitive package and can you just remind us on the timing for the launch of that just so we can sort of gauge where it is in our numbers?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Operations, Shaw Cablesystems   [6]

So the Shaw Digital basic was launched in approximately mid-April, end of April and yes, that has helped and as you look at any customer and as they have choices and stuff, it is nice to have options where you have different product levels at different pricing to meet their needs as they change or as they change their patterns and so we have found it to our advantage to have that other product offering

 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [9]

Hi, guys. I suspect the Hockey Night in Canada song is probably the easier one to learn. And I also want to thank you for holding this conference call in the morning. I think an afternoon conference call would be just mean. Two quick -- actually one quick one and then a more detailed question. The quick one is knowing the timeline now, do you guys -- are you prepared to talk about what the expected timing could be when you would tell us about what your wireless plans are?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chair &amp; CEO   [10]

Yes, I think you have got to give us a little bit of time, one, to know how much spectrum we end up having or not having and how that configures across, whether you roam with others. I think there is a lot of work yet to be done here, but the one thing that I can tell you is that Shaw, as usual, will take a very prudent approach to delivering a product that creates value for its shareholders

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [11]

I am sure that you will based on the track record. The second question, Jim, goes to you. This competition policy review panel, I notice that you were quoted in the newspaper reflecting the logic of that. I would join you on questioning the logic of the half measures. When you throw in the CRTC proposed moves that we have seen recently, government seems to be in its various forms moving against the telco cable industry or at least the bias is moving in that direction

Does this weigh into the Company's consideration of how much to rely on price increases versus subscriber growth when you are looking at your targets for overall revenue growth because it seems pricing is the hot topic for government these days and I note that it was specifically reflected to in this panel report? Do you have any comments on that?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chair &amp; CEO   [12]

I guess that what you are seeing though on our pricing -- well, we are able to achieve great growth. One of the things we have been able to do is bring a lot of new products to market. So we have given you a lot of different options within a cable realm, whether it is the one Brad was talking about, the new Digital Phone Lite and so we are able to tailor it a little bit more so if you want to lower your bill, you are able to do that

And I think that also what they don't realize, one, from a CRTC point of view and when you talk to Heritage or Industry, that if they go with a licensed 50 channels that only 50,000 people watch, there is a big cost to that and so the whole system is going to pay and worry they are not going to launch them when the rates are going to go higher. And I think they are asking for more capital investment on that side and more push on digital. So I think they are part of the problem too and I think they realize it and we sure may have been very vocal in talking about it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [13]

Point taken, Jim. Does this still make the Board and the Company management think a little bit more about maybe not increasing prices as much as you have in the last couple of years and maybe relying on greater subgrowth? I mean clearly there is some give and take on those two sides and not increasing prices would probably make it a little bit more difficult for the government to waive this whole -- Canada is just a bad place with a monopolist flag

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chair &amp; CEO   [14]

So, Greg, it was interesting, Greg. There was the misconception even amongst the CRTC when we appeared before them recently to talk about the PDU regulations. We were able to demonstrate to them that this notion that rates keep going up and up and up, but if you took a basket of products -- the telephone, the cable and the Internet -- and you look at it over the last five years, the rates have actually gone down for those products and it will go down by virtue of our bundling approach, which is the more you take, the more value you get. I think the commission was actually surprised by that, that there is this perception that rates keep going up, but customers can actually do better by bundling

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [15]

I'd have to say that we have been able to do a great job of balancing increases with products and on a consistent overall basis and we have not hindered the growth. But I can tell you we talked about it

 Rob Goff,  Haywood Securities - Analyst   [18]

Thank you and good morning. It always seems ahead of the launch of new services, there is a 20% threshold. The pundits say you can't do it within three years, the aggressive people say you will do it in three years and then you do it much better. How would you look at wireless with that perspective?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chair &amp; CEO   [19]

Good observation. (multiple speakers)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Haywood Securities - Analyst   [20]

It's a leading question

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chair &amp; CEO   [21]

We are not going to -- you won't get much out of us on that question

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Haywood Securities - Analyst   [22]

Okay, then can I ask a different question, non-wireless?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chair &amp; CEO   [23]

Okay, sure

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Haywood Securities - Analyst   [24]

In terms of the labor marketplace, can you say how tight that is and are you at full scaling or are you looking to expand there?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chair &amp; CEO   [25]

I mean we think, over the last year, we have actually grown significantly in our technical operations, our call center, all again trying to achieve certain levels of customer service and response that, given the footprint now of our digital phone, we have added sufficient resources in most of our systems to support all of our products and so we would see ourselves at virtually a full complement

 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [28]

Thanks, very much. I understand you can't talk about your wireless strategy, the auction, but it does appear as if you're going to get some independent new entrant wireless operators like Global Life [gave], maybe an [NT Venture] and so on. To what extent do you see them as being a threat, nevermind in terms of wireless, but to your core voice and even Internet businesses if they pursue wireless substitution? And I assume, but perhaps it is a wrong assumption, that you are not interested in wireless substitution yourself being a big wireline provider of both voice and Internet services, but would that be a fair assumption?

Unidentified Company Representative   [29]

I don't know if we have gone that far yet. I guess that -- we were one of the first people that took the high-speed product and offered a Lite product and were able to do it without cannibalizing the high-speed product and we were one of the first ones that came up with an Xtreme product and then we added PowerBoost, then we added Nitro. So I would tend to think that if you looked at our track record, we are open to a lot of new products that we would develop around our networks

The problem that new entrants are going to have is the same as everything. One, they start with no infrastructure, no call center, they might have a billing system, they might have some expertise, they might have -- maybe they have got lots of money, but it is that back office that really makes the service work

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chair &amp; CEO   [30]

And the existing relationships with customers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [31]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [32]

That's a very fair point. If I can just follow up on one more thing on the new entrant side, it was brought up at the beginning of the call in terms of foreign ownership restrictions and your position, wouldn't it be fair to say as it stands today all the incumbents -- yourselves, TELUS, Bell, Rogers -- actually benefit from foreign ownership restrictions because it does make it more difficult for some of these foreign players to come in who have shown interest?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chair &amp; CEO   [33]

I don't know if I would look at it that way. Wouldn't you look at it the other way where you would say all you have really done is drive it up for -- drive the price up for the new entrants in Canada and they will have to charge more to consumers? So how is that good? If your mandate is to deliver quality new products to Canadians, how can you do that when you bring in a whole bunch of people to drive up the price? Then I'll have to charge you more

Jonathan Allen, RBC Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [36]

Thanks very much, good morning. Jim, a question about the CapEx profile. Excluding what is happening in the wireless business, in the last few years, you have had some pretty big chunky spends, whether it be upgrades, head-end consolidations, node splitting, billing migrations, all the rest. And it seems that some of those big projects have been going on now for a few years and hopefully I think we are reaching the tail end of that. So when I look at the $700 million odd spend that you are doing this year, excluding the wireless, if you look over the next couple of years, should those big projects start to finish and start to bring down the overall CapEx budget, which I guess would in turn lead you -- give you some more flexibility on the wireless side?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chair &amp; CEO   [37]

Okay, why don't I let Peter run you through that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [38]

Yes. So you're absolutely right, Jonathan. You would expect there would be an end to spending. I think that we are seeing maybe a leveling off in the next couple of years, not including wireless, of course. But many of the -- our node segmentation will continue, but we are now getting into much smaller nodes and the costs of doing that are coming down. We are looking at upgrades, which are coming to an end in our major systems and are now going into our smaller systems and ultimately will slow down. So we see a leveling off I guess at levels that might be slightly less than what you have just described

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [39]

If you had to quantify some of the big chunky projects that you've got ongoing right now, could you characterize it as being that, instead of leveling off, you might even see CapEx coming down by, what, $50 million, $100 million or something when you think about all of these existing spends?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [40]

We would love to say yes to that Jonathan, but the reality is we are supporting -- we are growing, as well as with the cost of growing in terms of supporting customers over and above sort of success-based. Our networks really have to be first top rate networks, reliable and so there is a cost of doing that. But there will be a leveling off, but it is not going to be going from say $700 million to $400 million or $500 million

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chair &amp; CEO   [41]

Yes, it would be fair to say we feel it is going to remain generally consistent

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [42]

Okay, so if I can now try to put words in your mouth here, when you do get into the wireless business, then there would have to be at least some increase then in the CapEx. You wouldn't be able to just smooth it out at the current CapEx run rate

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chair &amp; CEO   [43]

Well, there would be some dual CapEx, so some CapEx that we are considering now in the $700 million would already contemplate any wireless plans we have. So it is not going to be 100%, it is not going to be that zero would not be included in the $700 million

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [44]

Peter MacDonald, GMP Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [46]

Thanks. Without getting into the specifics about wireless, can you discuss how you balance the funding requirements of those sort of initiatives against returning cash to shareholders? And to be more specific, would you be willing to use the debt capacity that you have on your balance sheet to fund these initiatives and then use the separate free cash flow from the rest of your business to return to shareholders as you are currently doing?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [47]

Well, let me first of all say that the cost of the spectrum will not be a reduction of free cash flow; it would be a use of free cash flow. So just to be clear, we talked about our guidance this year of $450 million of free cash flow. The cost of the spectrum will be netted from that after the $450 million. So it won't come out of the $450 million. And we have got a tremendous amount, Peter, of debt capacity and so we would be prepared to fund that on a debt basis. It is a relatively small amount for us, so we do look roughly at the levels where we are today versus our capital structure and our capitalization in total. So it is really not a major issue for us

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [48]

Outside the $200 million though when you look at the startup costs of the initiative, we don't know what those would be at this point in time, but would you also consider looking at funding that through debt capacity and so there is no real concern about you changing your philosophy with respect to returning the cash flow that the Company generates to shareholders?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [49]

I think as Jim said, anything you see us do will be prudent as you have seen the prudent behavior that we have exhibited over the last short period of time. And I think it is early to be talking about startup costs in the wireless business yet because we haven't come to that decision. We haven't announced anything there or talked about timing of that. So I think when we get there, we'll talk about that and we will give you -- if that is the direction we decide to go, we will give you a complete report as we did with Phone we launched a couple years ago. We gave you targets and metrics and what to expect from a margin point of view and we expect to do the same thing if and when we make that decision

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [50]

Okay. Could I just ask a quick maintenance question on the $16 million CRTC charge?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [51]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [52]

To get to the normalized EBITDA, do we just add that straight back to EBITDA or is there an ongoing cost that has to be reflected in the quarterly number as well?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [53]

Well, it's an ongoing cost. So let me just make a few comments on that. First of all, when we increased our guidance for EBITDA from 10% to 12% to 13% to 15%, some people noted that that was because we weren't going to be accruing Part II fees, which amounted to at that time for the year about $22 million. The Part II fees we pay are about $2 million a month. Now we have accrued the Part II fees. The $16 million charge relates to both the amount in the current quarter and $10 million that relates to the first two quarters

So what I would like to highlight for people is first of all when you look at our $356 million of EBITDA that we have just reported for the quarter and add back that $16 million charge, it is actually $372 million is the performance in the quarter

Looking at the -- the Part II fees, also from an analytical point of view just to help you out here, $10 million of the $16 million that we booked relates to prior quarters. So in other words, we would have booked $6 million in Part II fees this year had they been payable anyway, which is similar to the $6 million that would have been in the third quarter of last year. But there is an additional $10 million charge in this quarter that relates solely to prior quarters. So if you make that adjustment in both cable and satellite, you need to add $7 million back to the cable EBITDA and about $3.5 million to satellite. So about $10.5 million in total

And just to put that in perspective because I think this is important, when you exclude the charges then from those prior recorders that all got lumped into this quarter, the cable margin for this quarter would in fact be 49.6%, which is a record from what we have seen for quite some time and tremendous performance on that 19% growth and the satellite margin would go up a full two percentage points from 33.5% to about 35.5%

So going forward, as I said, about $2 million a month is the accrual and all of that is included in our guidance and so even with that $22 million charge for the year, we are still going to achieve that 13% to 15% growth and still going to achieve that $450 million of free cash flow even after we take out the substantial facility purchase that we have just made

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jeffrey Fan, UBS Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  UBS Securities - Analyst   [56]

Thanks very much. Two questions. One for Steve is can you review for us what your cash tax situation is looking out to the next couple of years? And secondly, more on the level of homes [passed] and the growth there, are you seeing a leveling off of construction activities in the last couple of quarters now? Are you seeing more of your adds in particular in digital phone coming from existing homes rather than new homes because obviously that has been a pretty big growth driver for you guys over the last few years? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [57]

Well, Jeff, let me talk about cash taxes first. So as we said in our guidance previously in one of our earlier quarters, we expect that, for fiscal 2009, we will be cash taxable partway through the year and that will be somewhere in the $100 million to $200 million range in terms of cash taxes for next year and then we will be fully cash taxable in fiscal 2010

The one thing I would caution for folks is that our effective tax rate is in that low 30% type range and the way it works for us is that that will actually reflect and be a close approximation of the actual cash taxes that we have paid. So I don't -- some of you take a discount off that assuming there is some depreciation or other effects that cause the actual cash taxes to be lower, but in our case, they actually do pretty well approximate that effective rate

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Operations, Shaw Cablesystems   [58]

Jeffrey, on the new homes and where we are getting the digital phone customers, pretty well most is coming from existing homes and we still have our Welcome Home program that we do for all newbuilds and we certainly have success, but the majority is coming from the existing base

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  UBS Securities - Analyst   [59]

And do you see that mix kind of continue to skew towards existing homes? Have you seen that trend kind of increase over the last few quarters?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Operations, Shaw Cablesystems   [60]

I would say it has been pretty well the same, steady-eddy, and we are still seeing that same type of mix and listen, on the [Welcome Home], us and TELUS -- we are really fighting it out in Vancouver and Calgary and Edmonton for MDUs and the residential piece. So we are still seeing a trend for existing

Glen Campbell, Merrill Lynch

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [63]

Yes, thanks very much. Sort of one general question, a couple of numbers questions. On the general point, where TELUS is offering TV service, are you still staying with your policy of not subsidizing set tops and equipment or are you sort of altering that on a win-back basis or in targeted areas to defend the base?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Operations, Shaw Cablesystems   [64]

I will answer that. We are -- on saves and win-backs, there is a little bit of a subsidy happening and on equipment when we give them an offer for six months or three months, whatever that may be. But on the retail side and in the market, we're pretty well -- we have maybe a slight subsidy we are [writing] on the equipment, but it varies quarter to quarter depending on programs, but this quarter may be a little heavier, but we are pretty consistent on trying to maintain no subsidy on our equipment from an acquisition point of view

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [65]

Super, thanks. And on the detailed points, Steve, could you talk through the mechanics of the rate increase? The press release indicates that it was partially implemented from April. So I'm just trying to get a sense of how much is in there and how much is still to come for subsequent quarters

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [66]

Well, for roughly about half the quarter there and going forward as we said, it is about $6.5 million per month or $6.5 million per quarter. So that is what you should expect going forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [67]

So it wasn't staged; it was just that it came in partway through the quarter?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [68]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [69]

Okay, super. And then --

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [70]

Sorry. $6.5 million to be clear per month, so it is about $80 million in total per year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [71]

Okay, super. And then a last one on the OpEx side, are you still sort of spending money with Bell Canada to support your phone service or have you transitioned that down or out to where you want it to be?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [72]

Yes, we have transitioned it virtually all out. So there still are some residual customers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Operations, Shaw Cablesystems   [73]

We still have some 911 and some services, don't we?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [74]

Yes, so operator services don't come through Bell, but long distance -- we are looking at -- we have another [class bore] or switch going in, which will allow us to be fully reliant on ourselves as opposed to anybody else

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [75]

And so the Q3 numbers you just reported would reflect that. In other words, that is true for the whole quarter, not just the current state, is that right?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [76]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [77]

Super. Thanks very much

Thank you. Good morning. My question is around the telephone business. Can you talk about how many you added in basic versus the sort of $55 a month service, so the $30 or $35 a month versus $55 a month service? And is there any reason for the acceleration in the growth rate of the telephone subs this quarter?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chair &amp; CEO   [80]

Yes, I think that while we wish we could give you that number, the number of our competitors are on the call would force us not to give that to you, but we can say that both products continue to grow well and that one is not cannibalizing the other and that is basically what we can tell you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Lambert,  Canaccord Adams - Analyst   [81]

Okay and just around the move away from Bell to your own interconnection, have you got an idea now how much you might be able to save on an annual basis from basically doing your own interconnections?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [82]

Well, we are saving it now, actually, so you're seeing that in the numbers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Lambert,  Canaccord Adams - Analyst   [83]

Yes, just trying to back out how much that is

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [84]

That's a number, David, I don't think we want to be too specific about, but it is all reflected in the EBITDA guidance that you see for the year and that superior kind of growth rate that we are forecasting

 David Lambert,  Canaccord Adams - Analyst   [85]

Okay, great. Thank you. Appreciate it. Great quarter

John Henderson, Scotia Capital

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Henderson,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [87]

Good morning. I don't want to focus on any kind of negatives in such a great quarter. I just wanted to ask though about DTH EBITDA. I mean I guess there is some rising expenses, a little more than usual it seemed other than the Part II. It looks like about 4% adjusted EBITDA growth. I wonder if you could provide some comment there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [88]

Well, first of all, before Jim steps in from an operational point of view, just let me remind you again that there was a $6 million charge against that satellite number in the quarter. So if you add that back in, that takes it up from $62 million to $68 million and would actually be ahead of last quarter and again, the margin adjusted for those prior quarters where the Part II fee has all been booked and lumped in this quarter would take the margin from 33.5% up to 35.5%. So a full 2% reduction and then Jim can talk about some of the additional operating costs we have in the business

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chair &amp; CEO   [89]

I think, like Steve said, I think the numbers reflect pretty positively what we have done in the quarter and we continue to hone on making sure that we drive every little bit of cost that we can out of the business and especially in the call center area, adding the third call center a year ago has made a big difference in us looking at opportunities to move things around a little bit, so I think it is pretty positive. And so it's just more of an accounting that makes this quarter look a little bad, but generally we are up and I think we generally have to say we are pretty pleased with the performance of the group this quarter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [90]

We were actually delighted that once again our call center in Star Choice was rated as one of the top call centers in North America in terms of customer response

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Operations, Shaw Cablesystems   [91]

And satisfaction, very pleased

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Henderson,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [92]

Great numbers. Can I just follow up on one thing on the CapEx at $700 million leveling off, that would include I assume plans, potential plans for switch digital video, that sort of thing?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chair &amp; CEO   [93]

Well, we are still not there on switch digital video. It is not totally ready for primetime. The industry hasn't decided whether it is going to really, really get down and deploy it. There is, of course, a lot of ongoing discussion between all of the major cable operators. It sounds really good consumer-wise. Technically, it is a bit of a challenge. We can do it, but is there a benefit behind doing it? And so there is still some questions out there. I think what Peter was saying is we got -- we still have ongoing long-distance, fiber and local fiber node-splitting and supporting the -- I don't know -- what are we, nine million calls a day now, Peter?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [94]

Yes, nine million telephone calls a day

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chair &amp; CEO   [95]

And how many e-mails? 60 million --?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [96]

Oh gosh, it is --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [97]

70 million

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [98]

70 million emails a day

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chair &amp; CEO   [99]

So we -- just to host all that stuff, we are going to have to maintain a certain level of CapEx going forward and we will drive efficiencies back and forth as best we can

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [100]

We look at our means, we prioritize CapEx because we can't do everything at the same time, so we do manage our capital as closely as possible and on the switch digital, it is interesting. Even in the US, cable operators are now looking more for upgrades for channel capacity than switch digital because it creates some complexities that would really undermine in some areas the quality of the service that customers are receiving because of the reliability of the [plant]. So upgrades are, as much as they are traditional, we have sort of factored those into that $700 million CapEx level and whether it is MPEG-4, 8PSK, new modulation schemes that might be coming out, DOCSIS3, we will work within our skin and within our means

 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [103]

Thanks. A couple things. One, regarding the upcoming decision on the -- I guess the specialties [in] BDU hearing. I mean the fee for carriage still seems to have some life and your positions on that are well-known. If they were to introduce some sort of fee for carriage, do you expect you will still be able to put through your regular price increases without any pushback from consumers? And secondly, could you talk a little bit about spectrum management on the data side? There is a lot of speculation out there that the video uploading that is going on by consumers now is going to start to put some pressure on networks. I am just wondering what your thoughts are on that and how you will manage that trend. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [104]

Well, the trend is -- every year, it seems like we are doubling the amount of data that we are handling on our networks and one of the challenges that we have said is and one of the things that we are prepared to do is to continue to scale our networks to be able to support the kinds of traffic that our customers are generating, whether it be telephone traffic or Internet traffic and we have managed to do that from the time we had 10% penetration now to the time that we are over 70% penetration. Customer usage and their habits are changing. Yes, they are downloading videos and more [bit torn] types of things, but we are managing our network to accommodate that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chair &amp; CEO   [105]

I guess one of the things, Peter, that we have talked about that we are kind of watching is the bid capping process that seems to be happening [through] the US for very, very high users that look to us like they are trying to take our top Internet service, use it as a commercial service at the degradation of all the Internet customers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [106]

And it is basically managing our network and there is going to be high users and there are going to be low users and they both are paying customers and so to the extent that we can accommodate them within the rate structure that we have, we will

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chair &amp; CEO   [107]

And on the fee, we would pass it through instantly and we might even put it as a separate line item on the bill. That would be probably Ken and John's recommendation and I think that there is a lot -- I wouldn't worry about it too quickly. I think there is lots of -- going to be lots of scrambling around that now as politicians finally realize what that would mean and how many calls they would get just over the fact that they are supporting people that made bad decisions in business and/or regulator with no real generation of any quality Canadian programming

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [108]

I think the hearing actually provided a great opportunity for us to demonstrate just how false the proposals without the broadcasters put forward as for their need for it and for the consumer reaction to it. So I think that the hearing was actually positive to demonstrate the value of cable and the uselessness of such a charge

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Totally

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [114]

I think Roger has indicated that they are prepared to go to the courts if the commission went and approved a fee for carriage. So I think yes, we will exhaust all of our avenues

 Adam Spielman,  PPM - Analyst   [117]

Hi, thank you. Just a couple quick ones. Could you just repeat what you said earlier about CapEx? I think you said guidance this year for over $700 million and then I think you commented on just generally about trends in the future

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [118]

I think what we said was that trends in the future, irrespective, so not including wireless, that they would be in that $650 million to $703 million range. We would expect that that would continue over the next few years as we finish our [upgrade] projects and as we finish our head-end consolidation and as we continue to segment our nodes. I mean our nodes have gone from 1100 customers per node to now 750 and it has had a significant positive impact in our reliability and our ability to handle the kind of increases in usage on a network that telephone and Internet are providing, as well as accommodating new HD signals

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adam Spielman,  PPM - Analyst   [119]

And in CapEx, is it correct to think that you benefited (inaudible) to the weaker US dollar? You are buying a lot of boxes and other stuff in dollars, is that correct?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [120]

We buy -- a lot of our vendors are US-based and so certainly our boxes are coming primarily from the US, all from the US actually. And amplifiers and fiber and modems

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [121]

And it goes the other way too

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Operations, Shaw Cablesystems   [122]

And a lot a lot of that is passed through to the consumer as well and lower consumer premise equipment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adam Spielman,  PPM - Analyst   [123]

Okay. And then just kind of contrasting what -- your performance has been very strong even relative to the rest of the industry in North America. I mean is it correct to think about -- I don't hear anybody asking about any economic weakness and housing problems. Is it right that the economy is just, particularly in Western Canada, still remains very robust?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chair &amp; CEO   [124]

I would say very robust in Western Canada, probably a little lighter in Saskatchewan though, a lot of activity in the mining and oil exploration side. Manitoba, generally just consistent. So I think we are certainly in two of the big growth areas in provinces in Canada

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adam Spielman,  PPM - Analyst   [125]

Okay. Just a couple quick ones on the balance sheet. I see letters of credit, $400 million or something. Is that related to the wireless auction process?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [126]

Yes, that is correct

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adam Spielman,  PPM - Analyst   [127]

Okay. And then your leverage is very low. I guess two questions on that. Have you spoken to the agencies recently? Is there any discussion of an upgrade and on the secondhand, do you anticipate keeping it that low or do you think it is probably too low right now?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [128]

Well, we would certainly love to see an upgrade here. We have postponed discussions with the agencies until we are through the spectrum auction until we can put some better definition around that. We will be doing that in the fall with the agencies. We are already rated investment grade by DBRS and in fact, they have moved that trend up to positive as well and so that is good

But we will be having further discussions with our Board. We are talking about our budget for next year today and we will be having discussions in the fall about [possible] target structure and one of the things, Adam, that we will want to make sure is that we don't become underlevered as we move into a situation where we are cash taxable. So we will be finding that sort of nice balance that works for us both from a financial point of view and from a strategic point of view

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adam Spielman,  PPM - Analyst   [129]

Okay. Final one, I promise. Just remind me, on the Star Choice business, how many satellites are you using and which ones -- do you own those are do you lease those from somebody, I forget?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chair &amp; CEO   [130]

It's Jim. We have two up there, F2 and F1R

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Operations, Shaw Cablesystems   [131]

And the transponder capacity is least

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chair &amp; CEO   [132]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adam Spielman,  PPM - Analyst   [133]

Is that from Telesat or from somebody else?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chair &amp; CEO   [134]

Telesat

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adam Spielman,  PPM - Analyst   [135]

Telesat, okay. Thank you very much

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

Thank you. (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS) Please stand by for your first question. Your first question comes from Tim Casey, BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [2]

Thanks. A couple of questions. Jim, I'm wondering, can you talk a little bit about as you go forward, where you think you are potentially vulnerable to a slowdown in consumer activity. Presumably, broadband and core cable is quite a defensive business. But where do you expect to see some pushback from consumers? And as a follow-up to that, could you talk a little bit about your ability to manage costs and preserve margin in light of toughening economic times? And lastly, just a quick one for Steve, can you remind us what the cash tax outlook is for 2009? I know at one point you expected to incur some cash taxes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [3]

Right. Steve, why don't you answer the cash one first and then we'll go backwards

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [4]

On the cash tax, we are not providing specific cash tax guidance right now. As Jim said, one of the reasons we pulled back from the CapEx guidance as well is we think it's important for the shareholders to know what the EBITDA growth is because that's a key valuation metric. We operate the business in a way that we're essentially making, as best we can, as we can foresee the commitment, that we will generate at least $500 million in free cash flow for shareholders but there are a whole bunch of moving parts at this point. One of them is CapEx and Jim talked about the additional rental program. There may be things we need to do to respond competitively there. Other things we may advance. On the tax side as well, we have executed and we are currently in the planning stages on certain business reorganization activities, which will have tax savings, but we haven't finalized those. And, of course, you've seen what's going on with the Canadian dollar as well, which has an impact on our CapEx and how we manage that over the next year. So there's a whole bunch of fluid things in there. Our message today for shareholders, we are going to generate strong EBITDA growth and you are going to see free cash flow growth, even in a year of continued CapEx investment and cash taxes but we are not going to be more specific at this time

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [5]

I think, again, when you looked at the business on a broader base that, basically we don't feel -- it's our feeling that Internet would be one of the last things to go from the home. And I think all the surveys throughout Canada and the U.S. provide backup to that with saying -- people saying in a recession only 2 or 3% said they would consider getting rid of the internet. You might see some variation in product in that people might downgrade -- maybe a movie network might be an example. You will also see people upgrade on the other side, where they have people say, gee, tonight, we are just going to barbecue. We normally went out on Friday night. We are going to stay home tonight, order a VOD movie. So we think our planned expansion and big digital push will provide lots of room to get all our products in there

And our brands are pretty competitively priced and even if you look at Shaw in comparison to where U.S. cable companies in the margins, they -- the prices they charge to consumers, we are really well positioned in that home. We are really flexible. We have all sorts of plans. So -- and it provides good value. That's why we think on the phone front and even on the cellular front, when people are looking to pick up dollars, when they go for our bundle, they will be picking up savings there and that will allow them to in turn come back and order an extra VOD movie or upgrade a TV and really kind of focus on the home thing, especially when some people might be losing jobs and that kind of thing. So really, you are going to have to focus on your home as your base and we don't see a long recession. In fact, if Brad had his way, he would probably like to have a month off to catch up on all the installs and stuff that we are behind on. I think we are still running 18,000 phone installs behind, like almost all the time with number ports and everything. So we probably could use a week or two of breather, but we don't see that in the market place

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [6]

And how about on your ability to manage margins?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [7]

Well, I mean, we are -- we are certainly the leader in North America in margin, and I can tell you that any U.S. supplier to Shaw, if they haven't received a call, will be receiving a call as Shaw goes back to renegotiate any pricing differences caused by the devaluation of the Canadian dollar. So that's an ongoing process here. I think even if you go historical and you look in times, I wouldn't look for a lot of retreat on the margin side from us. We are pretty -- pretty tight in there and we keep a really strong eye on it. So that wouldn't be of concern to me the all

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [8]

Okay

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [9]

Thank you. Your next question comes from Bob Bek, CIBC World Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [10]

Thanks very much. Just a couple of questions. You talked about 00 a bit about the competitive environment and some of the activities from Telus and your market. Can you give us a bit more color on that with the context of what you just talked about as far as the value proposition in your bundle and what kind of pricing and competitive response you're seeing Telus and any broader thoughts you have on fiber to the home activity that you are seeing into the future

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [11]

Okay. Well, I will go with the broad brush and then maybe Brad can give you some market specifics on what we are seeing in the cable operation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [12]

Great

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [13]

I was down in New York the other day and we were down with all the CEOs of all the top ten cable companies and we were going, over some stuff for cable ads and competitive positioning and this and that. And we ended up talking about Verizon. We got talking about their fiber to the home system and how they were spending $30 billion to take fiber to the home in this economic time to only at their estimate get 25% market share. So we just don't see the value proposition in that. And that's why we think we are better off to keep focused on our core business and have wireless come when the wireless model is ready for us. We are a believer in wireless, but we are saying during the economic times we are in now, it is not prudent use. We feel we are better to come up and launch a new 100 megabit service to provide another level of competition to provide like the frame and more HD product and a bigger VOD box server you should see from us, more offering of movies and content to get more flexibility to our main consumer which is still the residential home. So to go and build fiber in this community and then a bit in this community and a bit in that is really hard. What it tells you is by these big companies doing this, that they are scared to death of the broadband type because it has so much capability and so much flexibility across the board that the broadband type falls by fiber nodes and the networks that Shaw and Rogers and some of these other companies have are second-to-none in adding products and deliverability and flexibility at the consumer home. And then, Brad, what about on the local level? Well, there's -- well, when we talk about Internet, just for example and Telus TV, launching for the full quarter in Edmonton and Calgary, we certainly see aggressive offers from them and continue from MTS and SaskTel. And also on that we see a shrinking dollar base in Western Canada. But we are pleased with where we have been from the internet growth. And also the opportunity we are seeing is a real upgrade strategy in moving up our base on the internet. As the needs of internet increase and more video and more broadband and more multimedia and so we've had a lot of success in moving up the base. So we see opportunities going forward. We still see Telus on a tremendous discount of acquisition in the offering and we have tended not to match them. We continue to look at value and it being a premium offering to them. So we are consistently looking at ways to offer that. As Jim said, we've had challenges on the installs in doing that, but as we move our work force around, we are able to address that. That gives you a sign of the business and how strong it is. Along with that phone comes all the other things of TV, internet, and we certainly see the growth opportunity there, but there is some slowdown we are seeing in some of the new build and that type of thing. Yes, I always find it funny, Bob, too -- you know, I mean, to go, well, we are not going to give out our numbers of how many TV customers we have, because Shaw wants to find up -- well, if they don't think we are not that close to the market to know the number already, they don't know what they are doing. Because we are tight to the market and we know what's going on there. So the fact that you can launch a product and four years later not even say how many subs you have or how much it costs or what the economic model is, is amazing to me in today's financial reality world

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [14]

Thanks. That's very helpful. Just a quick one for Steve, if I may. Can you remind us where the spectrum -- I see it is in the balance sheet on "other" is there an offset on the payment or I just want to understand that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [15]

Yes it's $190 million and it's sitting in "deposits and other." And on the asset side, we had paid the 20% deposit, so there's $152 million that was owing at August 31st in accounts payable. That's part of the reason why you see the growth in the accounts payable year-over-year and that was all paid at the beginning of September

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [16]

I will leave it there for others. Thanks very much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [17]

Thank you. Your next question comes from Jonathan Allen RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [18]

Thanks very much. Jim, aside from what's happening with the financial markets and the turbulence that we are seeing there, has anything else changed on wireless in your perspective, have you found that would make the economics look worse than before, has (inaudible) proved to be harder to get or have costs of deployment increased beyond what you had looked at?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [19]

No, I would probably say it's coming more in our favor. I think that when you look at recent transactions -- I mean, just take, for example, the Telus and the Bell joint announcement on build. More cooperation between players. People are more willing to entertain more ideas now to reduce CapEx. We feel that some of the market players aren't going to be able to make it through the -- through the tide here. There's no doubt we are going to make it. We were never the first in internet, yet we came out with one of the most profitable models and now have the highest penetration. So we don't feel the burning need to get out there and get in that game. We are very optimistic about it. And when we enter, we want to be prudent and really know the structure and be able to provide the level of service that really Shaw is known for in western Canada. That's why as an incumbent, we are so strong, is because we continually focus back on that consumer. So we are really hesitant to go half cocked and launch a product to the detriment of our core business, where we see so many opportunities in front of us right now and to risk a lot of capital -- and I'm not going to say it is going to be a lot, because I guess it's not real, real material, and attention over to that when we have what I will call all of these things laying on the road that we can pick up, put in our tool kit right now, doesn't look prudent to us

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [20]

Well, Jim, you mentioned investing in the core business and launching DOCSIS is 3.0. Can you give us some guidance on what the cost would be for deployment? And second of all, I believe Comcast earlier this month had been giving some estimate that the OpEx cost of actually serving the customer under DOCSIS 3.0 was something like $5 cheaper than under the previous system. Have you heard something similar to that?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [21]

I don't know if I -- I wouldn't think that there would be that much operating cost. I mean, we are going to have some embedded software upgrades and there will be some network management tools we will have to put in place, but, I mean, we didn't see it as a big material cost difference. It's really a transition to the next level of cable modem that will provide just an unbelievable service to the consumer. We are just starting to work on the pricing for that right now, but it's not going to be a cheap service either, but for those guys that game and really want the thing to fly, we'll be the only shop in town that will have it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [22]

Well, if I can ask just one last clarification on that. Aside from the modem costs, what is the network upgrade cost? I think in the past you mentioned something like $30 million or $40 million

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [23]

You know, I -- it's in that range. It's in that kind of range

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [24]

Okay. Thanks, Jim

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [25]

Thank you. Your next question comes from Vince Valentini, TD Newcrest. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [26]

Thanks very much. I just want to explore wireless a bit more, Jim. You had talked before about doing a bit of a test in Calgary, play with it a little bit, see how the consumer response is, the technology works. When you say no material investment in 2009, does that mean even a bit of a technology or market test is off the table as well?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [27]

Oh, I wouldn't rule everything out, but I mean no material -- what I call material. So, we are still -- we are always fooling around with the network a little bit. We are running different guides and we try different modem speeds and we are trying different phone products on the residential. So we are always jigging the thing around anyway, Vince. So we will be doing a little test. We will be interested to explore some of the roaming arrangements other people have come up with. We will be interested to talk to other parties about that. We are interested to talk to new players about maybe some cooperative stuff. We are just saying it is not going to be a material item for Shaw in '09

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [28]

Talking about those discussions on cooperation, would one of the things on the table for you still be potentially just doing an MV&amp;O agreement with Rogers rather than spending the CapEx to do it yourself?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [29]

I think that we are of the mind-set where we wouldn't rule out anything. The one thing you know, at least with us, we have the financial power to do -- to roll it out or not. And so I guess then it just works out to be which is the economic prospect and you get down to who owns the customer and all of those kind of nitty details, which at the end of the day are where make all the money. I can say that we haven't talked to Ted Arnott, because before the economic model worked great for Ted but not for Shaw. Maybe something has changed there, maybe it ihasn't. But you are seeing all the wireless players starting to do a lot more together, more than they have in the past, as the try to build out their networks with more capacity to handle all this data. I mean one of the things about going to the new service, the DOCSIS 3.0, we are having to spend a lot of this capital anyway, fiber nodes, segmentation. We were busy with node segmentation last year to bring the network up to speed so that we can handle all the traffic anyway. So moving to DOCSIS 3.0 is a natural evolution and I think the same thing will happen as wireless players get used to new guys coming. Saying whatever we have. We said we don't want to be the biggest guy but what we have, we want to have a good return for people to put up the money and a good value prospect for the customer. And I think we have delivered that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [30]

One last one, Jim, if I could. In this environment, obviously with share prices for everybody being weak but credit also being tight. Can you give us the updated thoughts on how you view use of cash for dividends versus share buybacks at the current levels

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [31]

Well, Steve and I came up -- or we came up -- we talked to the board yesterday about coming up with a general matrix, kind of what we call a tool kit of where and what we are going to do with free cash flow and how we manage it and maybe, Steve, why don't you just outline the broad parameters that we are going to kind of operate under

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [32]

As you know, we are in great financial shape. At August 30th, our debt to EBITDA was 2.4 times, down from 2.7 times last year and 3.2 the year before. We've consistently decreased it every year for the last six or seven years. And so from a debt point of view, we don't need to be doing much more. What we were talking about yesterday at the board was sort of the strategic view of where we see the leverage going forward. We are comfortable with the range we are in right now. We think it's important that we continue to increase the dividend, because that's an important value proposition in increasing the value of the stock. We are comfortable with the yield where it is. But we will target further dividend increases which you will see more in line with the EBITDA growth on annual basis. Obviously, it will be very high up to the point where we are today

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [33]

And I think that we have talked with the board about -- we have always kind of floated around investment grade and not investment grade and whether we should put more effort into making it, not making it, and I think we are -- in the turbulence going on now, we are probably more of the opinion that we should probably work a little harder towards investment grade and so I would think that would be one of the goals that we'll come out of here with

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [34]

So we have tremendous amount of flexibility. We think we are there from a metric point of view. We can operate in this band, which is a great strategic band to be operating in, which will give us flexibility down the road. We are also talking about making sure that we don't become undercapitalized in the future as well, because that's not shareholder friendly or tax efficient or efficient for the weighted average cost of capital. So we were looking at some of those options for the future, but just looking now our run rate on the dividends is $340 million per year. Our free cash flow is going to be over $500 million, $500 million plus for next year. So we still have room to increase it through share buybacks. As I say debt reduction is not a priority, so lot's of flex here for shareholders

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [35]

Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [36]

Thank you. Your next question comes from Dvai Ghose, Genuity Capital Markets. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [37]

Thanks very much. I don't want to belabor this point on wireless, but Jim, as you know, it's a growth industry and understand you entered cable modems after Rogers, but you had no competition there. Telus didn't have an ADSL service for the first three or four years. This is the most penetrated market in Canada, in particular in B.C. Isn't there a risk that you are managing for short-term cash flow and to impress the street at the cost of long-term growth in cash flow. And in particular, isn't there a way of having your cake and eating it too? You talked more about partnerships on this call than you have before. Would you, for example, consider partnering with [Global Life] who is another new entrant in your -- most of your western Canadian markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [38]

I guess one of the things when you look at Shaw, the big -- the best thing we have is we currently have a relationship now with 3.4 million customers on video, data, and various forms and it's always Shaw's intention to lever those the most. I don't think you could look at call them one of our moves that would imply that we manage for short-term growth and not long-term gain for shareholders. So any time we entered anything -- I mean, even on digital, we were really cautious and we could have went right to the wall and got it out there and maybe jumped up our revenue and hurt our margins a bit. We never went and did that. And so we just -- with Shaw, you get a very cautious, conservative approach to market entry. I don't know if you are just coming to the network and you're just bringing money, then why would we ever want to partner with that person. What do they bring? Do they bring a really high level of expertise? Do they bring just money? I know they run a network over in Europe. There's some -- they have some guys. We have lots of people that can do that too. You would have to tell me that what they would bring to entice Shaw to have a partner like that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [39]

Well I won't speak on behalf of Global Life, but I'm sure they would say, number one, two people sharing a network is cheaper than building two, overlapping networks regardless of who those parties are. Number two, they will have 100 million subscribers, Alcatel Lucent's biggest customer in wireless in the world. Things that no Canadian can be as a stand alone Canadian entity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [40]

But if you looked at -- you said -- I mean -- I mean you could partner with Bell, maybe they are not that penetrated in western Canada, and Roger's penetration in western Canada is spotty. I think there's lots of ways to approach it. And they still have to build the whole network here. Another incumbent, part of your lease, they bring towers, roaming and different capabilities. So I think there's a lot of things in the equation you have to consider on the partnership side, and we have tended to go alone

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [41]

Sure. No. I appreciate that. There's lots of reasons for that. Okay. Two other ones which are more here and now. Record phone adds are really pleasing, especially when others are slowing down on the cable side in terms of phone growth. You started later and were more cautious in that as well, but to what extent is this being stimulated by the $20 to $30 basic customers and if you can just review the impact on margins and so on. Do you still think that it's lowered costs and therefore the margins are comparable?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [42]

We have it broken down for competitive reasons the split between the products. All the products are doing well. The light products having come out recently is doing very well. The margin in all of the products are strong. Obviously, the ARPU levels differ. What I can tell you, though, is that we've had a tremendous uplift in the margin in that business this year. And overall, in our digital phone business, we are running well over the 40% margin that we committed to three years ago when we came out here and launched that product with shareholders. All the products are contributing and are helping to make that business successful. And that's one of the big reasons why you see the uplift this year in cable EBITDA and also the fact that our cable EBITDA is substantially higher last year on a percentage basis

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [43]

I think, too, when you go and you look at it, we were really, really cautious when we launched light into the internet access, when we launched our -- what we call kind of a light high-speed product, so above the dialup, kind of more of an ADSL type product. We were worried that everybody would migrate off of high speed down to those products. In fact, it turned out to be a great conversion tool to get you into the product and then once you use the product, we are finding more people going up to high speed, power boost and then up to extreme and now making the move up to nitro than ever before

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [44]

Right

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [45]

So actually, while it's a good entry point, it's just a starter to get you moving up the ladder

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [46]

It makes sense. And last one, real quick one, it's obviously frustrating for all of us that Telus hasn't given us a TV subscriber number, even though they've been at it for a long time and spent a lot of capital. How much do you think they have?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [47]

You know, I can't tell you for competitive reasons. Isn't that what Bob says?

Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [48]

Touche!

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [49]

It's in the formative stage

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [50]

It's in the formative stage. We're just forming our opinion on that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks a lot

Thank you. Your next question comes from Glen Campbell, Merrill Lynch

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [53]

Yes, thank very much. A couple of detail questions and a bigger one. On the details, could you talk about how you will be impacted by the lower Canadian dollar in terms of your equipment and set top purchases going forward? How far are you protected on the exchange rate there and what impact do you expect? That's my first one and then I have a couple of follow-ups. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [54]

I don't want to be too specific at this point. We have seen a tremendous move here over the last two weeks. We will manage the CapEx as we always do within the parameters that we are talking about today and this is going to be one of the issues. One of the things -- one of the reasons why it's difficult to be specific at this point, we do have a portion of our exposure for the year hedged, so a third of it is hedged to favorable rates. So that's good for us. Another part of the equation is what we are able to pass through to customers as well on those rate increases in pricing and, as Jim said, we are going back and looking at the cost now on that U.S. based supply. So there's a whole bunch of different factors here. I think that's something probably we can be more specific on later in the year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [55]

Yes. It is a big focus for us. So have no doubt that it's high on the agenda

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [56]

Okay. Thanks. Then my follow-up was on the phone lines that you've got. The gains are great. Could you us a sense of how much of that is the small business segment and also how much of that is second lines. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [57]

Well, we don't really break out the -- the small business, but I tell you, it is strong in what we call the small business environment is strong, and you will see Shaw continue to build its regional teams in the areas and then as we get -- are we at 90% coverage on the phone now?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [58]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [59]

90?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [60]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [61]

And it's one of those things it's kind of like the internet in the old days in Fort McMurray. The smaller the town, to some extent the better we do in getting the local pizza guy and all of those guys signed up because they got no service. We have trucks on the ground. We have a guy who lives in the community. We are very accessible. So we are really finding a large take-up of our products. And, again, the products are designed to get you in at a modest level, get you comfortable about handling your phone traffic and then migrate you up the system. And then on the second lines, I don't know what we do there. They are separate lines

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [62]

We have to get back to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [63]

I don't know that off the top of my head

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [64]

Last one is on the wireless CapEx. You're saying it's not going to be significant. I can imagine that you do a lot of ground work during fiscal '09, lining up sites, organizing back haul, doing your negotiations so that really the actual heavy dollars would not come in fiscal '09 but early the next year. Is that how you are thinking about it or have you fundamentally changed your approach so that it is a go slower approach and you are really having second thoughts about how quickly you want in?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [65]

On the -- on the issue of wireless CapEx, the lining up sites is not really a capital intensive item, it's essentially just trying to figure out the topography or the geography of a particular market is going to look like, figure out where you want to be, what's available. You determine what you have to build, but you probably wouldn't do it until you absolutely had to. And bear in mind that we generally have fiber running everywhere which puts us in a fairly unique position in terms of back haul. There's very little extra that we would have to do. We know where all the sites are now, so I wouldn't see a whole lot of expenditure in that area at all. I think, as you know, every venture in the world wants to come in here and see us and is more than willing to spend a lot of capital for us if we want them to do it as long as we say their name at the end of the day. So I think we have lots of options in that area

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [66]

So in other words, we can expect this kind of activity to be going on through the year? And then --

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [67]

And it won't be noticeable to you is what we are saying

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [68]

Okay. Thanks very much

Operator   [69]

Your next question comes from Rob Goff with Haywood Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Haywood Securities - Analyst   [70]

Two different questions, if I may. The first would be on the high speed internet. Looking ahead, do you see the momentum being sustained more from dialup versus DSL migrators or is it the business starting to kick in? And then after the -- the other area of questioning, which is on the materiality and momentum of the Sojo and plans to migrate that up to the SME market place

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [71]

Why don't you do the first one and then Brad and I -- Rob, this is (inaudible - background noise). We mentioned a little bit earlier, we are certainly seeing opportunities migrating our customer base up as their habits change and using the internet. It is true that the dialup base is shrinking. We believe the offering we have and the premium service and value we offer for our internet service gives us an opportunity to look at competitive win backs in which we are taking a more serious focus at to see what opportunities are there. And we -- we believe with new builds, there's still opportunities there. There's some shrinking but we are -- we know the base is getting smaller and so we are going to look at opportunities to migrate the base up and in turn look at how we can turn on the competitive side

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Haywood Securities - Analyst   [72]

Okay. Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [73]

Thank you. Your next question comes from Jeffrey Fan, UBS Securities. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  UBS - Analyst   [74]

Thanks very much. This is more of a macro question. Over the past three or four years, we have seen very strong population, household growth in the west driven by the commodity boom and that's led to better than suspected subscriber adds, giving you a lot of pricing power. I guess my question is, as you look out the next couple of years and you just completed your guidance for 2009, I'm just wondering what are some are of the underlying assumptions in terms of some of the macro trends regarding households, population, labor costs, et cetera?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [75]

Okay. I guess when -- when we look at it, certainly we are forecasting to probably lead Canada in household growth, but which would be down from the kind of level they were at, I will call it a year ago. And while we are still seeing a continuation in Calgary here especially and in Vancouver of pretty good market places we are starting to notice some deterioration in house building in what I will call the secondary markets which would be Cologna, Saskatoon, Red Deer, kind of the fringe, maybe Lethbridge, those kinds. We are still family strong in what I will call Edmonton, Calgary, Vancouver, Victoria is not too bad. But they are all gradually going down. That's why we really feel a lot of our growth and increases will come from the new products that we are developing in home to existing customers and not be so reliant on basic customer growth. Now we were happy with last year at the 1% growth rate, roughly. I think it was at 20,000 for the year and that's always been our standard. We think that will continue to be, but it is not near as robust. The people are not moving around as much either now too

We are not finding the pressure for labor. People aren't stealing Shaw's employees quite as much as they used to. So that's helping us out. So I think we are looking at the labor situation being fine. We just made a milestone two weeks ago. We hired our 10,000th employee. So I don't know if that's good news or bad. I'm hoping that's still good. But things seem to be strong. We are not seeing any resistance from a pricing point of view at the consumer home level and we will continue to do periodic rate increases as we have done in the past. We don't tend to follow guys that just drop their price, like SaskTel would be a good example of a price dropper. MTS has gone away from that model and come back up. And we have seen rate increases from them. We assume over the long term that the larger telephone company in western Canada will take the same approach. You can compete on price if you want. We would rather compete on products and service, but I guess everybody at the end of the day has to run their own company

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  UBS - Analyst   [76]

Is there a risk if you look at the last three or four years inter-provincial migration has been very beneficial for Alberta and BC, and could -- is there a risk that that may reverse or -- I know you are probably not seeing that right now, but as you look out, is that a risk that we should, as investors, consider?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [77]

We don't -- we don't really feel in Alberta essentially and BC, to a large degree, that that's going to be an issue. While the markets are taking a bit of a kicking, a lot of the oil guys and I'm certainly no oil guy, is -- I mean, certainly $70 to $80 U.S. oil converted into Canadian is still a pretty good return. And so maybe they've had to migrate and adjust their business plan a bit, but it's still pretty robust for the Alberta and the British Columbia economy to a large degree. The date that we've looked at from CMHC and from (inaudible) across our cable operating territories, we have seen new housing growth at the rate of 2.1 to 2.4% over the last couple of years. Forecast over in next couple of years, we're in that sort of 1.7 to 1.9 range. So down a little bit, but not substantially different. And as Jim said, there's still a tremendous need for infrastructure and infrastructure support and the housing that goes around that in these economies

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  UBS - Analyst   [78]

And just one last quick one regarding your labor cost, you have seen cost inflation because of shortage of labor. What's the timing in terms of seeing that maybe come off a little bit? Would we see a benefit in 2009 or not as much of an increase in '09? Or could it be a --

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [79]

I think it would probably be flat or maybe up marginally. I mean, to control the labor costs, Shaw moved to a lot of what we call UBEs or unit based employees to fulfill the work orders. So we got the maximum sales potential, maybe paid the guy a little bit more and got a couple extra hours of work out of him every day, and we are able to handle the customers better that way. And so you'd probably -- we'd probably still continue with that, so I don't know if I would see those costs dropping a lot, maybe kind of flat to uppish

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  UBS - Analyst   [80]

Okay. Thanks for the insight

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [81]

I don't think I answered the last part of your question there. We are actually doing no work to migrate from the Sojo up to the large user on the telephone side. We don't really feel it's our nitch, plus the guys that we -- they always get new pricing. So we go in with a price and sure enough, the cell phone guy shows up with a different price and it's really competitive and the margins are really skinny. We don't think that's an area that we are going to look at for sure for a long time. We have our hands full just trying to do the Sojo medium and small market down. And that's where our focus will be

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [82]

Thank you. Your next question comes from David Lambert of Canaccord Adams. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Lambert,  Canaccord Adams - Analyst   [83]

Couple questions. First of all, just wondering now that you've delayed your wireless launch, if you could do something like Cablevision, which is launching some sort of Wi-Fi service to -- to dip your toes in the water of that wireless?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [84]

I guess that's something we could explore. We've -- we're up what I will call -- up to speed a bit is what Cablevision is doing there. We keep an eye. One thing good about the cable companies, they share information between themselves. I mean, I'm sure we could see a good business model there, we would come back to you. Right now we haven't seen that so far. They are pretty condensed system in the whole New York area. So their demographics are a bit better than ours, because they fit them so tight and ours is a very spread out type of system. So they are a little bit different to operate. And I guess it's another tool in the kit, but I wouldn't see it being right on the forefront

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Lambert,  Canaccord Adams - Analyst   [85]

All right. And is there -- are there any regulatory issues you guys are dealing with right now that should be aware of that could help you reduce the costs?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [86]

No. I mean, it is -- there's a review coming up, and (inaudible) also there's a review coming up of some potential internet regulations that they are considering. We think they have a little or slim hope of getting that done, given the environment and the openness of the internet and certainly we will be there opposing any extra tax on Canadians. There's some talk about fee for carriage, which decision is coming out fairly soon. We have been pretty well against it. To us looks like another fee for carriage and a tax on existing Canadians for products they receive now for no cost. And that -- all you need are those things that do happen will be passed on by Shaw so there will be no internal risk to us. But there's only -- and every other provider will have to do it too. So it really just means that, again, Canadians are paying for something they don't really need and the government wants to intervene on

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Lambert,  Canaccord Adams - Analyst   [87]

All right. Great. Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [88]

Thank you. Your next question comes from Peter MacDonald, GMP Securities. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [89]

Thanks. Just trying to get my head around the guidance. I'm really -- I think it's a little bit on the conservative side when I look at it. I mean if you look at -- you had really strong growth last year on your subscriber loading, it looks like you have good momentum going into this year and even if it does slow somewhat on some housing issues and maybe some maturity in your products, there's still good growth there. You've always increased rates, even in difficult economic times, and you said today that you're going to continue to look to go down that road and as well you talked about the margins being pretty safe and a company that's pretty resilient in difficult economic times. So when I look at last year, doing 16% EBITDA growth on cable and then this year going to 10%, it seems conservative. I wonder if that's the way I should be looking at it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [90]

I guess at then of the day, you are the analyst and I'm not. I think -- I guess when we look at it, we are really optimistic about some of our new products we have coming. Some of them will take a little time to mature before they provide really solid bottom line, what I will call bottom line profit in there. But, listen, it's a number that when you feel comfortable putting out is achievable. We are not a company that likes to disappoint. We try to do better and certainly I know the team here is trying to do better than these numbers. But we wanted to put something out there, to put a range or put a matrix in place that we felt comfortable talking about

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [91]

Okay. Thank you

Operator   [92]

Thank you. (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS) Your next question comes from Adam Spielman, PPMA

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adam Spielman,  PPM America - Analyst   [93]

Two quick questions, on Star Choice any kind of different views on the future that this is within the Shaw portfolio, obviously not that big and then some changes over on the Bell side. I'm wondering if you guys think about that differently over the long term?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [94]

No, I mean, the margins are good. It's got a stable base of customer. We got a great team running it there. We are pretty comfortable with it. It also provides a whole bunch of back haul capability to Shaw and delivery to all of its other cable networks. I wouldn't say it is a half part, but it's a really nice part, we like it. We are comfortable with the business. We've really turned it around from four or five years ago, when it used to lose $100 million to $50 million to where now it's a solid contributor to the bottom line and to free cash flow. So I think we are pretty comfortable with it. We, in turn, have some plans to try and make it a little consumer friendly, do a little bit of work on its look and feel, which will be coming up in the next quarter or two. We are actually pretty excited about the prospects there. I think it's just one of the family

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adam Spielman,  PPM America - Analyst   [95]

Great. And then just one for Steve. Steve, as you point out correctly, the balance sheet is in pretty nice shape. It seems like you are not investment grade all ready, you probably should have been a while ago. You do have some kind of some bonds coming due, you know 2010 and '11. Have you given any thought how the balance sheet might look over the next few years?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [96]

I should probably invite you to the meeting with the credit ratings we are going to have soon

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adam Spielman,  PPM America - Analyst   [97]

I tried!

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [98]

Because we feel the same way. As I said, we are comfortable with -- from a strategic point of view, the debt being where it is today and that's 2.4, 2.5 times level. We might see it go down just -- we won't be paying off debt, but we could see it go down to around the 2 level and then we start to consider at that point, I think, perhaps some rebounds and looking at potentially doing some opportunities to recapitalize the balance sheet. But these will all be in line with opportunities that might present themselves at the time for things like share buybacks. There's nothing guaranteed. We could let it go lower than that as well. Again, we want to make sure that we are not undercapitalized and not inefficient from a capital structure point of view. So very much in the range that you're kind of seeing right now, not likely that you will see increases, unless some significant opportunity happened here for a share buyback or something, which we don't see in the near future

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adam Spielman,  PPM America - Analyst   [99]

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first comes from Bob Bek of CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead, sir

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [2]

Thanks, good afternoon. Jim, could you perhaps give us a bit more color on the landscape. Obviously you had a very strong quarter but you mentioned in your release about increasing telco competition. I guess you talked about that last quarter, having some you aggressive offers from TELUS in the market on the TELUS TV. Could you update perhaps on that environment, on any changes as far as how aggressive your competitors are being? Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [3]

Okay. Why I don't get Brad to run through that a little bit. Bob, just to give you an idea, we saw compared to Q1, 2008, to this past quarter of Q1 2009, about a 60% increase in TELUS TV disconnects. So we're not seeing -- we're continuing to see aggressive competition but we still see them challenging with some of the technical challenges, and getting bandwidth to the home. That number is around 4,000. That gives you an idea of just where that number is going

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [4]

Part of the view out there is obviously strong numbers from yourselves and from other peers through November. And then concern perhaps that the December numbers might be a little tougher. Anecdotally looks like you're still talking fairly strong tone. On the digital side one would expect December was pretty solid. Any broad strokes you would want to characterize on December, Jim

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [5]

When you look at it, across the board we're in great shape. I mean, some of the matrix we achieved in first quarter were year-end analyst targets so that's the way I like to start out a year. So I can only go better from there, at least, if nothing else I'm only even. But the way we look at the market right now, the take-up of our new digital rental program product which is really designed for what we'll call the average consumer, the value bundle across the board, we have seen very little slowdown and in turn we're seeing our Internet data traffic increase as people move to spending more time at home, more time on YouTube, more time doing online shopping or whatever they do and so we're actually seeing the Internet matrix go up as they migrate up from high speed to Nitro or to what's the other one called? Extreme. Extreme. So we're seeing a lot of migration there. We're seeing a fairly strong take-up of VOD and increased digital product across the board. So, I mean, what we see right now, it's looking strong and I wouldn't call for a large weakness. We think that in Calgary in the marketplace that while there's been a lot of wealth devaluation for a lot of people in the marketplace, the job devaluation, there hasn't been a lot of job loss here and I think that's reflective in how strong our numbers are

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [6]

That's helpful. Thanks. I'll leave big questions for others. Just a couple of model questions perhaps for Steve. The part two fees that were in this quarter but not a year ago, do you have a ballpark as to the amount in the quarter? We see that again in Q2 as well right, where you're paying fees that weren't there a year ago; is that correct?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP, CFO   [7]

The variance year-over-year in the quarter is $4 million in total

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [8]

Okay. Thank you. And just on your taxes, I guess the same sort of broad commentary for the cash tax for the year at some point during the year, sort of 100 million to $200 million, does that still apply, Steve?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP, CFO   [9]

It will be somewhere probably towards the lower end of that range. I think what we'll do at this point in terms of -- as we said last time we haven't provided specific CapEx guidance. I think we still need flexibility in the business to be able to adjust. You can see how well the digital program is running and we want to see how that sort of plays out. So we come to you in the next quarter conference call I think we'll be maybe a bit more definitive where we're going to be but for now for CapEx and taxes, we'll defer the guidance. But you're not far off the range there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [10]

 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [12]

Thanks, good afternoon, guys

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [13]

Good afternoon

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [14]

After today's 5% dividend increase, the payout ratio of free cash, I think it's a little over 70% on your current $500 million guidance. That's partially non-cash taxable. And assuming for next year, fully taxed cashable, fully cash taxable, somewhere toward 80% and so number one, I want to know if I'm correct in the cash tax assumption there? Number two, more importantly, I'll admit to being a little surprised to see another dividend increase. Could you comment whether you actually have dividend payout targets and if you do, can you share that with us? And secondly, where's the Board getting the comfort? Obviously, there's some flexibility on CapEx with respect to demand. As time goes on I'm anticipating that you should see an absolute decrease in CapEx as subscriber demand starts to diminish but I would also think that there's a possibility of significantly higher upside on the operating cash flow. I think you're probably thinking both of those things. But either way, I would be interested in knowing where the Company and where the Board is getting its comfort level on the dividend payout, vis-a-vis where the Company's free cash is right now? Thanks a lot

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [15]

I guess that while we couldn't put it in our original release because of course the Board didn't meet until the next morning and I think by regulation, Steve, we had to have our statements out yesterday, not today. So just a little bit of a timing thing on regulation reporting. Otherwise, it would have been in there so you would have got to see the whole picture all at one time so it's a little more awkward, even for us. I think when we looked at the growth and the Board looks at the five-year model, they look at all the models and we continue to update it and they update it quarterly, I can tell you we had some Board members that thought it was not high enough. And -- but I think the general consensus was that in a Company like ours, that a modest or moderate return, that return basically half of the increase that we received year-over-year back out to shareholders, that comes in the second half of the year, right, Steve, was it was a fairly moderate thing to do and I think they also felt that in looking at the Company's financials and growth prospects going forward, they have, like, pretty serious confidence that everything will be there because you know dividends are easy to get in but they're hard to get out and I think that just reflects their position on the internal workings of Shaw and what they know about the Company and where it's going. So they look for that as a consistent approach, not to generate the stock to maintain a certain level so people can exercise or do whatever. They don't worry about that at all

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [16]

Okay. And so obviously you're not going to give me any indication of--?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [17]

You're exactly right

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [18]

On the target, right. But can I ask this. Does the Board and the Company think about telco for example, telco targets on free cash and earnings payouts somewhere in the 60 to 70% range, is that -- do you think about those sorts of things?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [19]

I -- I'll give you a little scenario that we spend -- even though the odd time we probably -- I would never do it but people here take shots at other competitors that might be ARBOCs. I'm probably a little kinder and gentler than that. But basically we don't -- we spend all of our time focused on what we're doing. And so we wouldn't -- we don't look at matrix for what Rogers pays or what they do. The only thing we would like to know is are we in the margin range, is there some specific like, say, capital input that they're doing that we haven't thought about. Is there some competition. Like when Rogers' numbers came out, our big worry was that our numbers are quite a bit different than theirs. Is there something happening in their marketplace that we should know about, like something that the ARBOC came up with that makes us or made Rogers usually not as competitive over the quarter. When we're seeing something different. So that's the only time we really have a good, hard look at it. And other than that, it's usually, if we're talking ARBOCs, it's usually almost always them catching is

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [20]

Can I ask a quick follow-on thing to Steve? It's a bit of a modeling thing. The release itself makes reference to the IFRS accounting changes expected in 2012. Steve, I'm happy to take this offline if the answer is too detailed. But I'm wondering if at first blush you could say whether you know if this will have an impact on the capitalization versus expense issue vis-a-vis customer install costs?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP, CFO   [21]

Well, I'll say two things, Greg. One that is we haven't first of all concluded on IFRS or the potential of going to US GAAP. We haven't made that final conclusion yet. We're still studying IFRS and the implications of that or the implications of going to US GAAP as most of the comparatives in North America are reporting on US GAAP and will be doing so for quite some time going forward. We're also still -- we're studying the issue of what you asked there about capitalization of the subsidy under IFRS and we have no conclusions on that at this point

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [22]

Okay. Thanks a lot, Steve

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Allen of RBC. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [24]

Thanks very much. Hi, Jim. You mentioned actually in the last remarks about benchmarking some of the competitive differences between yourselves and some of your peers and looking at Rogers in particular and whether something was happening specifically in their markets. I'm curious what the conclusion was that you came up with on that?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [25]

I don't know, I mean, I think that we concluded that we couldn't see any material difference. Maybe our only conclusion was that the economic slowdown in Ontario was a little bit stronger on the job loss side and that might have slowed -- people may have got a little more hesitant to change within that period. When your family goes into a lot of turmoil, change is not something you really kind of adopt very quickly and then our other conclusion was maybe the value -- the value proposition that they proposed to the consumers was maybe not there, maybe it was there. We don't get quite that deep in there but we wanted to make sure that at first blush, we hadn't missed something that would come back and a quarter from now I would just find out or in a month from now I would find out, well, this happened and they did this and Rogers lost that and we didn't know about it. So it's just that kind of thing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [26]

Well, do you worry that maybe there's just a lag between what's happening in Ontario where manufacturing and autos were hurt a little bit more through the course of 2008, and maybe there's just a lag as we start looking at job losses starting to pick up out West, I think half of the national job losses last week came from the West Coast, so you're not really seeing any signs yet in your markets?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [27]

We haven't seen any signs of it and our numbers would not reflect that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [28]

But as far as dividends and all the rest, I assume you're taking a little bit of a cautious internal forecast?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP, CFO   [29]

Well, I think we're still very comfortable with our forecast of in excess of $500 million of free cash flow for the year and I'll just go back to dividend question as well, remember that at the rate that we're going to pay now for the year, we'll pay $350 million out in dividends, that still gives us a $150 million of cash head room on an aggregate dollar basis. As Jim said, the Ontario economy has been a jobs led recession where in Calgary we've gone from 3% unemployment, to 4% unemployment which is still effectively full employment out there. So it's a wealth effect, things may change going forward in the future but I think the circumstances are a little different between the two regions at this point

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [30]

And we're just not seeing it yet. I'm not saying that next quarterly call when we see it, we'll tell you when we see it. We just haven't seen it and our numbers don't reflect it at all

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [31]

That's great. One follow-up question for you, Jim. Since digital was just doing so well this quarter and from the numbers you disclosed in January and December, have you seen any sort of flow-through or cross-sale opportunity? Like digital sold so well so customers were picking up other services as well? Did we get a bit of a boost this quarter that may not be sustainable?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [32]

Wondering, Brad or Jay can--? Yes, you'll see some of that pick up. Our digital plan is focused right at the analog base. We're really going after our core and protecting that. We have opportunities to upsell Internet. If our speed changes increased right across the board, except our lights, is really nice enhancement for people to jump in there and we're finding some good opportunities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [33]

Can you give us any numbers, to sort of flow through or upselling?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [34]

We haven't -- I mean, our first market with DOCSIS 3.0 comes up this month, Saskatchewan is up this month so they're the first ones. As we said, we got them all in '09 so we're really looking forward to bringing that product out, especially if you have to hang around home and job hunt from your house

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [35]

Great. Thanks, Jim. Thanks, Brad

Operator   [36]

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Fan of UBS Securities. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  UBS Securities - Analyst   [37]

Thanks very much, good afternoon, guys. First question is regarding ARPU. I know you guys don't disclose the individual product ARPUs, but I was wondering if you can just discuss qualitatively what you are seeing across the various products? And the second part to that question is regarding pricing. From my record it looks like the last time you guys made any meaningful price change was back in April of 2008. Just wanted to verify that you guys haven't done any since then and just the general plans around that? And I'll leave it there and maybe have a second question follow-up

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [38]

Hi, Jeffrey. We'll continue to, as we have in the past, have regular increases in our product pricing and it's constantly a balancing of value and we think by doing the kinds of things we do in terms of enhancing our products, that is increasing our speed of our Internet, increasing the actual quantum of services that we carry on our digital services, that customers still appreciate the value proposition, irrespective of the fact that there might be a slight rate increase. The increases went -- I don't remember when they were -- September? September for Star Choice and April. April would be the cable one and as recent as September on the satellite side. And we've brought the gap together on some bundles and spread it on others. As we see competitive things happen in the market we do a little fluctuation on promotion and what you get. You get a couple movies free if you sign up, that kind of thing. That's just more of a market-driven process

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  UBS Securities - Analyst   [39]

So it would be reasonable to expect some price increases in this April for the current fiscal year?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [40]

I don't know if that will be when. But it will be reasonable to expect that once a year the product numbers would change

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  UBS Securities - Analyst   [41]

Okay

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [42]

But the timing you would have to leave to us. We're going to be a tempter of the market, competitive type of issue, with us doing a little comparison around and saying now's the time or now's not the time. We could do it two ways, we would do it by increasing our top price but we could also do it by consolidating the margins when you're a double play or triple play customer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  UBS Securities - Analyst   [43]

And any color on the individual products ARPU in the current quarter in terms of year-over-year trends?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [44]

Well, the overall -- sorry. The overall ARPU for all of of our products is continuing to grow. It's a great trend and if you go way back from Q1 '04 all the way up to current time, quarter-over-quarter our ARPU continues to increase. Some of our products like on the telephone product I think you can see that the ARPU might diminish as we're getting into more competitiveness but it's actually a factor of how you consolidate that ARPU into an overall product bundled ARPU which is going--. You drag other products along as you promote the product--. Exactly. Then on the digital, before I think we said about $20 ARPU and we're a little early in the stage on the digital rental programs. So we'll have to see how that goes forward. But I wouldn't suspect much different as we get going. Brad is right. It's early days on additional rental, but the ARPU on digital is running over $20 and we'll see how that lines up and how well it bundles as well. There's some great opportunities there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  UBS Securities - Analyst   [45]

Okay. Thanks very much. I'll leave for others

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [46]

Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter MacDonald of GMP Securities. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [47]

Thanks, just before I get to my questions. Clarification. In the beginning in your comments, Jim, were you suggesting that your strong growth is more of a market share benefit for you rather than market growth in general?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [48]

I think maybe market share of the products, a lot of talk about HD TV, a lot of people expanding into it, even over what I'll call a slow economic time, only because they're spending more time at home. So it's becoming more of a priority. Star Choice has done a great job with their HD promotion on their product across the board. Cable is doing quite good on theirs. Our digital enhancement. So I'm saying within market expansion rather than market growth expansion, I think

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [49]

And on digital, what were the digital terminal adds in the quarter and I would assume, tell me if I'm wrong, that those would be primarily leased versus sold?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [50]

Yes, we decided, Peter, to stop reporting digital terminals because the figure has largely become meaningless over the years. If you look, for example, we did 60% better at retail activity on digital boxes this year, primarily HD in December than we did last year. We're one of the few people selling pieces of consumer electronics equipment that did well so that digital figure, when you start to look at it with the HD in there now and the addition of the rental boxes and all that, it's really become a figure that doesn't mean an awful lot. So I don't have that figure for you and we won't be reporting it going forward. What would be -- we sold -- would the majority have been rental or sold? Open rented. We're probably like 80%? 95. 95% we were just told Just the one box line that we're doing. We've only done one box line on the rental program so far and I would assume down the road you would look toward us to do more than one box rental program. What I mean is that where we're selling HD boxes, a lot of those are to existing customers who are upgrading. That's why the terminal figure is becoming less relevant. We take the other ones back in and we rehab them and give them a little credit then we take the new one and change, it's just getting to be kind of a churn thing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [51]

If I look at digital in general, so we've had a number of quarters here with good results, great results, looks like that flowed through into December and maybe a bit into January. I would assume that a lot of that has to do with the leasing program but you still have a very large penetration gap compared to the other cable companies on digital. So should we be looking at this as a pent-up demand in -- for demand for digital, possibly enhanced by the Christmas selling season, or should we expect that you will continue to have strong loading in digital and maybe close that gap up a lot more from where it is right now?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [52]

I think it's our intent we'll close that gap, right? Yes. I mean, we've already said over the years that if you want to put the pedal to the metal and focus on digital, we could. The time is right now with the advent of the DCT700 box which is a low cost box, it was a terrific time for us, an opportunity for us to get into those analog customers that have never experienced digital that haven't taken the opportunity to get an HD box or the previous DCT boxes and there is a pent-up demand. We see that demand continuing to -- there's no reason why, given the same kind of circumstances, that we wouldn't have a similar kind of penetrations as they do in other cable systems. We think in fact with our plan that we can exceed that. To be clear, so you're not confused, we're only renting the DCT700 today. When we talk about retailer activity and the high definition side, all those boxes are still being sold to customers at this point. And this is really easy installation, that's the other thing. So a lot of of our boxes are just mailed to our customers and they install it themselves so our cost of getting the box to the home are very low

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [53]

Okay. Thanks a lot and good quarter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [54]

Thank you. Our next question comes from Vince Valentini of TD Newcrest. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [55]

Thanks very much. First off, want to clarify, Brad. You said before in the 4,000 disconnects from TELUS, is that how many subs you lost to TELUS TV or how many came back to you from TELUS TV?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [56]

I would have to dig a little deeper for that, Vince, I just have an overall number here. I think that's taking in and outs and the whole flow back and forth. I would have to follow up and get you more detail. 50% of the customers that call us to go to TELUS, actually end up not going to TELUS. And then we're finding certainly with their technical challenges, a certain number of customers are coming back. That can't get it installed. Yes, or there's a limit on the number of boxes. I thought it was this. I didn't think the speed would change over the network and it does. And I'm on the Internet while my dad's watching NFL and that kind of thing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [57]

Also clarification for you Jim. In your opening comments you emphasized a couple times cash is king and you guys are going to be prudent with free cash flow deployment going forward. Are you giving us any sort of signaling here with regards to wireless in the future? I know you said those investments would be minimal in 2009. Are you at this point thinking that even in 2010 you wouldn't be spending any money to deploy that wireless spectrum you bought?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [58]

I think what we're going to do is we'll have a good look at that, probably another quarter or so, I think that what we do see is we see a big opportunity on the the digital rental side. We see some good opportunities within the Star Choice group and essentially in the cable group too. We want to do some different kind of bundling. We have a couple new products ideas that are available there to return cash to invest in capital that returns cash flow right away to shareholders and stakeholders and you'll see us do that first. I'm not saying we won't do anything in '010. We haven't made that decision. But we're still sticking by that we're not doing anything in '09 and we're going to consider '010 what we're doing then

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [59]

Last one then, with the dividend increase spending more money on the dividend this year now, does that imply that you may be a little less aggressive with share buybacks or is there room still to do both?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [60]

Well, if you could tell me the price, I could give you the answer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [61]

Pretty sure now it's about $20.60

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [62]

Well, I mean, I'm not allowed to trade until tomorrow, so maybe I could tell you but then I'd have to kill you right after. I think it's no different than always. We'll be prudent with our capital. We like to kind of nibble away at everything. We felt it was time for a dividend and that's why we moved ahead. So Steve and I and the team will evaluate the share buyback going forward. I would always look for some. I wouldn't probably look for a huge amount

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [63]

Okay. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [64]

Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Goff of Haywood Securities. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Haywood Securities - Analyst   [65]

Thank you very much. There's a lot of talk on the economy. Can you actually use that to your advantage in that the tough times actually makes a heightened consumer value position that you may be able to offer, you may get more attraction as wireless within a bundle? And also given the tight or tough capital markets your financial strength is more of a competitive advantage. So is there a different way of looking at the economy and seeing a reason to perhaps push the wireless ahead?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [66]

I think you're seeing us do exactly that without the wireless. And our big debate would be whether we include the wireless in that or not but that's where you're seeing our total focus is on our internal bundle and how do we take everything and lock and load them all together and that's why I think we've had such a successful quarter is that the team here has come up with a way that we continue to lock and load all our customers, across the products we have in front of us today and that's why they're so excited about DOCSIS 3.0 and some of the other products we have coming towards us. Barring -- wireless yes or no wireless, either way it looks to us like our value proposition is so strong that we'll be really successful, whether we have wireless in the mix or we don't. So now it's just -- it's a matter of taking our attention and what do we want to focus on more. We've tended to go to, we focus on the dollars that are in front of us, not the dollars we could possibly get

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Haywood Securities - Analyst   [67]

Okay. Thank you very much

Operator   [68]

Thank you. Our next question comes from Dvai Ghose of Genuity capital Genuity Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [69]

First of all, your margins remain very good, especially given your strong subscriber growth but they're relatively flat year-over-year. Albeit last year was unofficially high because of Part Two fees. Have your margins now rebounded to as high as they can get on both the cable and satellite side or do you see further margin gains?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP, CFO   [70]

Well, first of all on the satellite side as we said before, we've seen satellite in a fairly consistent range over the last couple of years, anywhere in the sort of 33, 34, 35 kind of range. On the cable side, we've seen solid growth over the last couple of years, up from 47.4, 47.8, 48.5 last year. We're down a little bit in the first quarter this year. That's because we have our normal salary increases at the beginning of the year. We have some network fee increases. We have additional advertising and maintenance. But certainly, Dvai, there's room for some further growth and margin improvement. We're still seeing improvement on the digital phone side. That's doing very well on the margin side across all of our various products. And as the digital rental model comes on and we get the ARPU uplift from that, all of that is opportunity for us. And remember, we've got the biggest opportunity in North America in terms of our digital penetration so there's lots of potential growth there which is profitable growth for us and will drive margin

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [71]

That makes sense. My second question relates to CapEx. Obviously the success based CapEx in the quarter was very high which is a reflection of your success. Having said that, how religiously do you take this $500 million free cash flow guidance because you can perhaps envisage a scenario where you continue to add far greater subscribers than you have in previous periods and therefore incur the CapEx and depress of free cash flow temporarily. Is $500 million of free cash flow the be all and end all or will you sacrifice that for growth?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [72]

What would you rather we did?

Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [73]

Well, the dividend makes it a little more difficult. Personally, I would sacrifice the $500 million for growth

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [74]

Okay. Let's go with that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [75]

Okay. Couple of other quick ones, the AWS license, have you got your license yet? Are you still waiting for Industry Canada?

John Brasso,  Shaw Communications - VP, Regulatory   [76]

We filed our --

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [77]

They were just coming here. We filed what, John?

John Brasso,  Shaw Communications - VP, Regulatory   [78]

We filed our application with Industry Canada. They are now examining it and we're waiting for their response to it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [79]

I'm assuming if they wanted to give us back the money, we might give them back their Spectrum. No, I'm just joking. I don't think they're going to be fooling around with that. Next thing you know, they'll be wanting us to qualify as non Canadian

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [80]

Fair enough. I think you're about as Canadian as they get

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [81]

Thank you, mate

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [82]

Last question, Jim. Little bit more of a personal question about some of the insider selling we saw at the end of last year. Your family and your Board have accumulated a huge amount of stock over the years. There's been some chatter because of some insider selling at the end of last year. I don't see it as particularly material myself. But perhaps you can address the audience and give some color around it?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [83]

Sure, sure, I'd be glad to do that. We had some options that some of the execs here have that are all expiring within a year. We have very little time frames that we can exercise within. The Shaw family, I'll just talk about the family, because I know that one the best. Its core holding is still running about 49 million shares, is what we hold, I think. Somewhere in that range, Steve. I think we bought in the last couple years 9 million. I think if we took the whole exercised amount after you got to pay for the shares and everything it turned out to be how many shares? That's the purchase side there. 123,000?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP, CFO   [84]

123 million

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [85]

Oh, yes, no no. No, it wasn't that high, right?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP, CFO   [86]

It was under 1 million shares that were exercised

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [87]

Exercised, but we don't get all the shares. You only get the uptick from the granting. So when you've kind of got it down there may be a couple hundred shares and mainly most of the people were just tax. And so you're going to see a little more down the road from my father, when the window opens. He has some that come up within a year and I think he'll exercise them and do them sometime. Some of the other people here do. Nothing that I would get alarmed at. As you can tell as the price went up to 22, 23, I don't know much about timing anyway

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [88]

Fair enough. Ron Joyce obviously just stepped off the Board today. He's a huge shareholder, he sold a little bit. I assume that's a similar reason rather than he's going to blow out his position?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [89]

Yes I think -- Ron's really supportive. He's a big component of a dividend increase as you can understand

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [90]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [91]

But he also is -- he's 80 years old and he says I'm going to want to sell off and on as I go. That's probably partially the reason he stepped down, one was his age. Two, maybe he's a little more freer there because he's not restricted as you are when you're a Board member. He can do whatever he wants with his holding. I think at his age and he probably needs to kind of get focused on the future sometime and he has a lot of toys to pay for too. So it's always his money. He's been in a long time. Been a good shareholder. So I can't say anything bad there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [94]

Yes, thanks very much. I joined late so tell me if you've covered these already. Timing on rate hikes for the current year, can you tell us anything?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [95]

We will have them. We will have but we haven't decided the timing on everything

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [96]

Okay. Thank you. A follow-up on capital intensity. If you look at Cablevision, they've been able to run their CapEx to revenues in the low teens and I'm thinking, Shaw being a very efficient operator, do you see that sort of level as being achievable if you leave wireless out, if you leave the small business initiative out, once the business starts to mature?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [97]

I don't know if I've looked at them specifically. The one thing that I would tell you is all the 3 million are located in one city. Which is a lot different operation than like us where all of ours are located in 70 or 100 cities or towns or whatever. The density is probably two times greater-- Number of hubs and architect the network so there's a lot of difference there and one thing Cablevision also has been able to do is, I haven't looked at it for a while but their revenue per sub is very high and so that might also make their CapEx look artificially low but I haven't spent a lot of time looking at it so I don't -- that's just off the top of my head

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [98]

One last one, if I might. Your sub growth was quite strong in the quarter and revenue growth slowed. Can you talk about anything that was going on with pricing or promotions that might explain that?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [99]

No, I don't think there's anything unusual going on in terms of pricing or promotions. We had no unusual promotional activity. Other than what would be standard for the preChristmas period, so wouldn't be a lot different than the first quarter, the year before. Part of it is mix as well, Glen, right?

Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [100]

Yes. Okay. Super. Thanks very much

Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lambert of Canaccord Adams. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Lambert,  Canaccord Adams - Analyst   [102]

Yes, thanks. From your leasing of digital boxes and the price on your PVR that you dropped at $300, can't help to think that you're departing from your old strategy of not subsidizing boxes to starting to subsidize boxes. I was wondering if you could talk about how much you're leasing your digital boxes for and are there bundles in there where the customer is not paying for the digital box and also how much it costs for these PVRs that you're telling at $300?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [103]

First of all, we haven't strayed from our no subsidy approach and our boxes right now are $498

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Brasso,  Shaw Communications - VP, Regulatory   [104]

May have retail jumps in and drops the price lower, but our price is $498

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [105]

We're $498, Dave. Sometimes retailers have boxing day specials and they blow out loss leaders and those types of things to get people in there to buy TVs. We're still maintaining the no subsidy approach on our boxes and we're able to do that. Customers still see value in an HD PVR in that $498 range. Recall, a couple years ago they were $700 plus. And then the DCT is less than $100. Our monthly rate for that is very, very attractive and customers are happy to pay that low fee to get those boxes and we're seeing a good return on that investment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Lambert,  Canaccord Adams - Analyst   [106]

Okay. So you're not distracted by the fact that TELUS is now giving away a PVR?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [107]

No, we're distracted by other things in TELUS. We're looking at being prudent in terms of where we spend our CapEx. We always have had an approach which is we prioritize where the priorities exist and as Jim has alluded to, next month we're going to be launching DOCSIS. We continue to segment our hubs so that the number of customers being served in a distinct hub continues to go down which means their service reliability and their through-put goes up and as we've recently just increased the speed on our Internet products and customers seem to have really enjoyed that, because it differentiates us one more degree from our competitors in addition to the customer service that we offer. Right. And we -- I mean, we've competed against free before too. We just fail to understand why here you're trying to keep tighter price discipline in the cellular network and now because they can't get any traction on TV, they drop it down to nothing. So now they really make nothing on nothing. We just don't totally understand it. If you want to give them away, give them away. We hope they work. Maybe one day they will work well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Lambert,  Canaccord Adams - Analyst   [108]

 John Henderson,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [111]

Yes, thanks very much. I just have a follow-up on the ARPU question and by my math I guess over the last couple of quarters your ARPU growth has been really good at 6% or even better. This quarter, still good ARPU growth about 3%. It does show a slowdown. I wonder to what extent that might be sort of economic climate, maybe fewer video on demand rentals or what else you might point to that could cause that?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP, CFO   [112]

Are you referring to overall ARPU, John?

John Henderson,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [113]

Yes, I'm just taking your cable revenue divided by your total RGUs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP, CFO   [114]

ARPU has consistently increased every quarter over the last five years here

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Henderson,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [115]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP, CFO   [116]

One of the reasons that you're seeing it coming down a little bit as Peter alluded to before, is that, on the digital phone product as we've increased the segmentation on that product, we've offered customers new alternatives at lower prices and so we're seeing the ARPU on the digital phone product come down. At the same time, those are all great products for us and we're seeing the margin, for example this year compared to done Q1 last year substantially higher and still running well in excess of that 40%. So it's partly that segmentation of new opportunities in the digital phone market that are lowering digital phone ARPU. That's sort of softening maybe some of the increases you're seeing in overall ARPU but everything else is holding in very steady or growing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 John Henderson,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [117]

It's actually not a ARPU decline, it's just less growth than it was before?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP, CFO   [118]

Exactly

Hi, I'm calling on behalf of Glen Campbell. I have a question. Could you please update on your plans for DOCSIS 3.0 deployment?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [122]

So I think Brad had indicated that next month we're actually launching DOCSIS in one of our markets in the prairies, in Saskatchewan. Yes. And we have a plan to start deploying that over the next six months, Calgary. All the major markets, all the major markets in '09. Yes. And whatever else we can do from there. I mean, we want -- the major is the most important for us to get out and then we can harvest the full route, don't you think? That's right, Jim

 Bob Bek,  CIBC - Analyst   [2]

Obviously, you guys have the very strong RDU growth, which you talked about there, Jim. Specifically on the digital side, I know there was some press recently, I guess, Peter, you were quoted as talking about an 80% penetration target for digital within the next year. So that would require many more of these quarters of sort of 100%-plus -- I'm sorry, 100,000-plus growth that you put up in Q2. Is that something that is realistic in this kind of environment? And I guess it begs to the second question on your comfort with the ROIC of the digital program that has really ramped up?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Operations   [3]

It's Brad here. Well, considering the ramp-up in the early stages, we just launched the program in October. We recently launched as of March 10 rent over HD and HD-PVR. And we're certainly seeing tremendous momentum and tremendous pickup. We don't see any signs of things slowing down. It is our commitment to hit 80% penetration on the base within one to two years. So we are focused on that. And I can't tell any more than that. Certainly we are seeing good signs of ARPU, and the program is going well. But we're still in early stages, but we certainly see it continuing to have that kind of success

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [4]

And I think, Brad, would there be a lot of people, or Peter, a lot of people moving to the HD side, to the heavy PVR side, not to the lighter side, which is low-end digital?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Operations   [5]

Yes, that is right. And especially as we launch the rental program, we're certainly excited with the initial first month of take-up. But it is early stages to tell us how far that demand will go. But we're certainly excited about the initial beginnings

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [6]

HD televisions are still selling very, very well in retail. And so we're seeing that experience as well. So as we do in all of our products, we offer a low-cost entry into a rental environment, or we offer a little higher cost. And customers that have the means can choose which one to go into

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Operations   [7]

And we certainly know how sticky they are with the PVR and the experience on churn. So that is really going to benefit us going down the road

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC - Analyst   [8]

Okay. Well, that also leads to the question on CapEx and I guess on the free cash flow guidance, which you maintain at the CAD500 million level. I think, Steve, you talked about in the prior quarter about being able to perhaps be a bit more definitive on CapEx and taxes as we move along the year. You are still, again, maintaining that CAD500 million. With the CapEx required for this digital program, how do we kind of get to that CAD500 million? And are we still looking at cash taxes sort of at CAD100 million to CAD200 million level?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [9]

I think, Bob, at this point, predicting cash tax exactly is still -- it's still difficult. CAD100 million is going to be a high figure now for cash taxes. It will probably be more in the range of about half of that, let's say. There's a lot of balls up in the air with regard to CapEx. We've got the rental program. We've got --

Unidentified Company Representative   [10]

DOCSIS 3.0

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [11]

We've got DOCSIS 3.0. We just rolled out, as Brad said, the HD and HD-PVR rental program on top of the base rental program. And so our focus for the balance of the year is going to be to take all those moving pieces as we sort of get our cash tax number more finite as well, and to run the business in a way to ensure that we deliver for our shareholders the current guidance that we are stating, which is CAD500 million-plus. If we have opportunities in there, if our cash tax number comes down a little bit further and we've got some opportunities to advance some spending on CapEx, we think that is a good thing to do. There are some projects we would like to proceed with. And so we will do that with, again, this focus that we will be managing to the CAD500 million-plus number

Jeffrey Fan, UBS Securities

 Jeffrey Fan,  UBS Securities - Analyst   [14]

Maybe a follow-on for Steve here. In the quarter, you guys sold some capital assets that netted you about CAD20 million, and you guys offset that with the overall CapEx. And I think you guys provided that change in the definition last quarter. But as we look forward, how much proceeds should we still be modeling or expecting from these types of sales for the rest of the year?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [15]

There is nothing else material, Jeff, that we'd anticipate for the balance of the year. And just so you understand what that was, as we talked about before, we bought the land and facilities to be able to establish a really top-notch campus at our Barlow facility here in Calgary, expand our call centers and really get those groups well put together. We sold the Star Choice building that you see when you are driving down [Jericho] from the airport. And that was what was sold with the proceeds we received for it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  UBS Securities - Analyst   [16]

Okay. So nothing for the rest of the year and nothing for likely in fiscal 2010 as well?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [17]

Nothing material

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [18]

Nothing material, like maybe like a little in and out here and there. But the year before, when we bought the facility, how much did we pay for that?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [19]

We paid CAD50 million the year before

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [20]

So CAD50 million would have come off the year before to get us in -- that was part of our plan to generate this big campus kind of idea

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  UBS Securities - Analyst   [21]

Okay. Great. Thanks very much

 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [23]

First, I want to come back to digital in a sec, but first question just on the DOCSIS that you have rolled out, I believe you are charging like CAD250 or CAD270 a month for that 100-megabit service. Can you give us any sense of if there's actually any demand at that level and what you would be thinking about for the future? I can't imagine you're going to keep it that high forever. Maybe that is just your first-wave pricing?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Operations   [24]

Yes, that is exactly right, Vince. It is just testing the market. We are only in one market right now and we plan to roll out the rest over the next two quarters. So it is just really testing the market, where are things that, what do we need to do. So we're really in that preliminary stage

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [25]

No reason to make other guys have to work at us too hard, the other telco guys. We can't make it too easy for them, eh?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Operations   [26]

Because we still have some pretty compelling 15-megabit services as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [27]

Oh, yeah, we've got that and 100 megabits, and this and that. It's hard to catch up when, you know, you are driving a Volkswagen

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [28]

Okay. And on the digital, I think there is some concern in the investment community about this dramatic increase in your subs and what it could do to your margins and perhaps your CapEx going forward. So is there any more granularity you can give beyond your answer to Bob's question on the ARPU you're seeing from these subs, what type of margins you would expect and what type of payback you would expect to get on the box cost investments?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [29]

Well, let me say, I think that is a completely wrong argument to look at. We've got the lowest digital penetration in North America, which means we've got the biggest opportunity for growth here. And we're seeing it realized very quickly, going from 40% penetration at the start of this year to 47% penetration in just the course of six months

We have just started that rental program. We're still in very early stages. The fact that the ARPU is lower and the margins are a bit lower are fine by me, because the aggregate dollar of EBITDA is going to expand rapidly. And it is all about absolute dollar growth, not margin percentage growth, at the end of the day that is important. So I think that is not the right way to look at that, and to look at this as a tremendous opportunity for us to be able to expand EBITDA going forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Operations   [30]

Yes. And it really goes to protecting the core, which we have always said, which really secures that. And I think on the return on the box and the payback, around a 20-month kind of range?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [31]

Yes. Yes, that's right

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [32]

Jonathan Allen, RBC Capital Markets

 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [34]

A couple questions for Steve. Following the CAD600 million bond issue that you did last month, after you pay down the debt that you had called in the bank lines, it still looks like you've got CAD300 million-plus, CAD400 million. Are you actually looking to tender or prefinance some of the other bonds coming due next year?
  Or it brings up the question -- sort of a separate, related one, maybe, for Jim -- that TELUS has been out there talking a lot about their TV product, and maybe we will start to see some sub numbers from them soon. Is digital enough, in your view, to compete against TELUS TV, or would you like to have another product in your cards there and have something about wireless and time to rethink that?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [35]

Well, I will start maybe with the prefunding; then we will let Jim answer a question here. So on the CAD400 million, we really don't have the opportunity to prefund. The $642 million that comes due next year is a US obligation. It is hedged. We have looked at breaking that hedge and we have looked at some swap alternatives there. And we don't see that. So we will just be sitting on that money until that comes due

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [36]

So, you know, we're going to have a bit of a negative carry here for a bit. But we decided that we wanted to have the money. And just so you know how things work here, we had like a group hug at (technical difficulty) yesterday, and we hugged the satellite guys and we were hugging the cable guys and we were hugging everybody, and said, you know what? I don't know if you're not feeling the love, but you know what, it is coming down really quick

Now, that CAD2 million or CAD1 million a month or whatever it is in negative carry, that will be eaten up right away, right? We will get that fixed up. So I can tell you that one thing you deal with our group is totally anal, and last I looked, we all live on Uranus. That is our planet. And you know what, you know, somebody told me one time, that is just how it works. And if you do not think that our shop don't run that way, it runs totally that way

And the good thing is that even if I am not around and I have to leave for a week, Peter is here, Brad is here. And if you do not think the love ain't coming out of here, you don't know much about our shop. There is a lot of love happening here, and you know what? We expect it to be delivered at the end of the month. So, you know what, you just deliver it, deliver it all day

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [37]

I'm not really sure how to respond to that, Jim, but let me -- (laughter)

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [38]

You asked the question; I just gave you the response by saying, you know what? You want to know the love? You want to hear what the inner works are? These are the inner works. And you know what? If you want some love, just call us

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [39]

Maybe I can ask a slightly different follow-on question. When you did do the bond issue, there was this interesting little covenant in there saying that you could lever up or sell some data at Star Choice. Should we be reading between the lines that -- you had mentioned, Jim, about focusing on the core key differences. In your view, is Star Choice a key business, or is this willing to go up for sale at the right price?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [40]

No, you know what? I think that we are of the mind that it is core to us, and you're going to see some new stuff come out on Star Choice. It is going to be called Shaw. It will be Shaw Direct. It's going to go right to your home, and we're going to ramp it up. We've got a little more pressure on it. Jimmy is here to tell you a little bit about that. But you know what? We are not looking to sell kind of a CAD2 billion division off of anybody like that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Operations   [41]

And we have run Star Choice like a core business

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [42]

It's a core business

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Operations   [43]

And that is why it's doing (multiple speakers)

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [44]

They help cable; we help them; they help us

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Operations   [45]

And we have a tremendous focus on the business

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [46]

Focus. Right there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Operations   [47]

On [satellite] and all those divisions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [48]

But can I just clarify, just for the benefit of Jonathan and what you're asking there, that was actually a tightening up of the covenants for the benefit of the bondholders. Previously, we could have leveraged Star Choice up, which would have been done at the subsidiary level. What we said is that we won't lever it up at the subsidiary level. But if there ever was an event, and we're saying here we don't anticipate it, but if there is an event that we can't sell it off or spin it, at least we've left ourselves some flexibility to be able to recap it before we do that. We certainly don't anticipate doing that, but the fundamental idea of the covenant was to provide better protection for investors

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [49]

Okay. Thanks for the loving, guys

 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [52]

On wireless, I'm going to ask the question, Jim, you commented again earlier on focusing on key businesses. And correct me if I'm wrong -- I think what you're referring to is in a time like this you are focusing on the core businesses of the Company, and maybe that is part of an explanation as to why you're not going into wireless right now

I wonder if you might comment on what the senior management team thinks of when making its decision about timing on wireless, or if you actually want to go into wireless. I have suggested it might be the economy that has held the Company back, but there could be other things. Maybe you're waiting for costs of network components or handsets to further come down. Maybe you're waiting for partnerships. I wonder if you might give us more color just on how the management team and perhaps the Board thinks about timing, or if you want to go into wireless at all? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [53]

Okay. This is a pretty big question. I guess when you look at it and you look at the whole process and when talking to Steve or Brad or Peter or whoever we're talking about it, when you look at it, we have not seen a compelling reason to get in there. Now, it does not say that -- I don't think we were wrong in buying the spectrum. I think we were totally right. But I cannot see -- and maybe the group here, I don't know, they can jump up -- there is no compelling reason to jump in there. We think that the wireless numbers for all the companies are going to come off the sheet. They're going to be weak. There's a lot of problems in wireless. There's a lot of price competition, a lot of things like that

So we are just kind of on the edge to watch and think about what to do for us. And my role as CEO is to ensure that, you know what, if you are a shareholder of ours, I try to create the most value for you. And you know what? I just don't see that opportunity, Greg, like it just, like -- you know what? It is there, but it is kind of there, but kind of not there

So, you know what, until it is there, you won't get our group committed. And you know what? I'm probably reflecting what Peter and Brad and all the boys say here. But you know what, you just won't get us in

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [54]

Can I ask a quick follow-on? That suggests that the Company is willing to wait at minimum until new entrants come into the market and you see what kind of changes happen to pricing and possibly to demand. Is that the case? I mean, are we literally looking at minimum a year wait, possibly longer?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [55]

Yes

 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [58]

Steve and Jim, congratulations again on a great bond issuance. Just wanted to ask you a question about dividend growth sustainability, because obviously that's been a great hallmark of your story over the last few years. So as you correctly pointed out, you're exactly at the halfway mark with exactly half the cash flow that you promised at CAD251 million. But if I take away the CAD21 million of asset sales, which you suggest are nonrecurring, CAD230 million, and fully tax a number -- you allude to the fact by year-end you probably start paying some taxes. If I use a 30% tax rate, you are about CAD160 million versus about CAD170 million of dividends paid in the first half. So given that backdrop and the fact that unfortunately we are going to have to start paying cash taxes, do you see any further room for dividend growth, or indeed, do you think you can lever up to increased dividends?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [59]

You know what, and I know Steve will jump in here, but I'm just going to start with this. I will start with, you know, the thing is that when you look at it, I mean, our family has 50 million shares in there. And Brad is sitting here at the table and I'm sitting here at the table, and my father is not here, but he would be here. And you know what? I can tell you, we are in this thing all day long, all day hard. And you know what, we're going to risk our money with everybody else, and if you do not think that we don't want to get paid either, that would be a strange thought to have come out of anywhere. Like, I don't know where it comes from, but you know what? It won't come out of me

I am just telling you that's what I feel. The last I looked, I was the CEO. I'm just going to leave it at that. I don't know where it's going to go. I've got to talk to the Board. But I'm telling you that the family is in there. They're committed. They've got all their money in there, all of it. And you know what? I will be looking all day long, just thinking, you know what, what has happened in the past will happen in the future

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [60]

Fair enough. Jim -- sorry, Steve, do you have anything to add?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [61]

Well, I didn't follow all that pro forma math, but what I can say is for this year, we're going to generate free cash flow of CAD500 million or more. Our current dividend rate is CAD360 million, which means we have CAD140 million right now of additional cash cushion between where we are paying dividend and where we are generating free cash flow

For next year, we expect that the business will continue to grow with all of the things that we have going on here and the experience that we are seeing. So we will have a natural growth in EBITDA. Some of that will be offset by the cash taxes. But again, even at the CAD360 million level, we're going to increase dividends by let's say 10% to approximate EBITDA growth. That is CAD400 million. I think we would hope to be doing better than that next year and the years after in free cash flow. And we will advantage the business that way

So I don't think the cash tax impact is going to be that big that it is going to impede our ability, with the amount of headroom we have today, to continue to increase the dividend

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [62]

Okay, that makes sense. On the wireless side, Jim, you've approached it as sort of a new business in terms of adding revenue, cash flow and so on. But what about on the defensive side? As you know, wireless substitution in Canada is less than 10% because we don't have any unlimited rate plans like they do in the US. In the US, it's in excess of 20%, and wireless is taking share, not just from phone companies, but from cable companies as well when it comes to home phone lines. Is there a risk that if you don't act on wireless at some point in the next year or two that you will be susceptible to that loss of share without any sort of offset in terms of gain?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [63]

Well, let me kind of just change it around a little bit that, one, we don't think we have to have it. We have all these guys, whether it is TELUS TV and all these guys attacking us that have made no traction, nowhere, no-how, even though they offer the product at like a rate that is unbelievably cheap. So to think that we have to have something, it's more about -- with us, it's more about we deliver the product. The guy comes to your home. The service calls are free -- I don't care if you want 10, you can have 10. If you want 20, you can have 20. If you only get one, you only get one

And you know what, so it's more about that. And to now kind of think we have to have some extra bundle is not true. Look at Star Choice or Shaw Direct or whatever we call it now, is pretty successful on its own. Look at the combination of Express View with Bell, and it loses CAD300 million a year (multiple speakers) make 100. Like, I just don't get it. I don't know why they can't get it. I don't get it. They don't get it; I don't get it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Operations   [64]

And frankly, the driving product in our bundle is Internet, followed very closely by our digital video services. Those are the two that actually have some passion with our customers. And those two products are the reasons -- and the fact that we are adding value through our rental program -- those are the reasons that we are growing as we are. We don't see that changing

 Glen Campbell,  Banc of America - Analyst   [67]

I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the surge in customers who are signing on for digital and how they are spending. Is the rental program just in this group of new customers, or are you finding a lot of your existing customers are renting boxes, too? And the extra ARPU that you are getting on digital, I think you mentioned a figure of around CAD20. Would that figure apply for these brand-new customers, or is that just an average and the incremental customers are coming on at a lower figure? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Operations   [68]

(multiple speakers) Both customers are using the DCT700, those that are buying the box and those that are renting the box. The ARPU is virtually the same

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [69]

Yes, it is still very early days in terms of the ARPU, because we've brought on -- with the promotional activity that is going on at this point, I think it is too early to conclude on what we will see there. But the way we modeled the economics of this when we looked at it was, even at a very low take-up rate like even one pay-per-view movie a month with the rental program, we've still got great economics. And we are seeing some customers taking second boxes for our new customers, and some existing customers taking second boxes as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [70]

Yes, absolutely, Glen. They will buy a first box, and they see that CAD2.95 rental. And rather than upgrading the TVs, they can get digital access to VOD and the guide and music. And we're seeing that. But certainly, the majority is the new customer rental. And our focus is on analog. And that is our initial drive, and we're really focusing in on that core in protecting and allowing them to grow our EBITDA and ARPU in that direction

Okay, thanks. And maybe a quick follow-up. DSL win-backs -- you'd talked a couple quarters back about launching them, targeting sort of a new base for your Internet subscribers. Have you started that in a big way yet, and can you talk about how it is going if you have?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Operations   [72]

I think it is ongoing. We compete. We very much monitor offers, rates in our markets and what is going on. But we continue to compete with TELUS and they compete with us. I can't say there's anything specific we're going after. It's certainly as we -- 50% speed increase, all the value enhancements, as Jim said, free service calls -- all that adds up to a great experience. And so we're certainly seeing the benefit of that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  Banc of America - Analyst   [73]

 Rob Goff,  Haywood Securities - Analyst   [75]

Guys, could you go over what you are seeing in the marketplace with respect to TELUS TV and SaskTel and MTS? Do you see them gaining momentum or holding flat? And are you also seeing the digital as a bit of a win-back product? I know it has defensive characteristics, but are you seeing it win back people who may have gone the TELUS route?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [76]

You know, I don't know -- Peter, do you want to start? Brad, Jay (multiple speakers)

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [77]

Peter here. So I will just give kind of a higher level. We see -- you know, that's a great point. The digital offering that we have right now, when we attract 106,000 customers that make a conscious decision to get a box, they are doing it for a reason. They are doing it because they see value in it and they see an expanded experience when they're dealing with Shaw

Many of those customers also come to us because they have also seen the increased value in our Internet products. So some of those customers could be coming from the likes of SaskTel and MTS. And we have a new product in SaskTel that certainly is helping to attract customers who may not have been previously with us. And it is all done in order to make sure that the customer experience, whether they're really focused on the Internet services or digital or they have more TVs that they can be serviced by on a DSL offering, we want to have something for every customer. Brad?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Operations   [78]

No, that is a great point, Peter. I can't say we are seeing -- we are pleased with what the success we are seeing in MTS's markets, SaskTel. We're not seeing really anything different from TELUS TV as they continue to increase their footprint. They have become more aggressive in the middle of February, launching a CAD15 TV package bundle. So we're seeing that more discount on their parts. But, Jay, do you have anything to add on that? I think --

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Group VP, Shaw Cable   [79]

I think we're pretty comfortable with the competitive activity that is happening in the market, and certainly Saskatchewan and Manitoba have stabilized (multiple speakers)

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [80]

And how we've been doing -- you know, I mean, have we been doing okay, or like --

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Group VP, Shaw Cable   [81]

Yes, I think the numbers tell the story, right, in terms of --

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [82]

The numbers tell the story. And you know about the speed increase in Saskatchewan

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Group VP, Shaw Cable   [83]

The launch of the Internet [speeds in the] sweet spot in Saskatchewan and really helped us turn that market around. And throughout Alberta and BC, we are absolutely holding our own, as you can see in our numbers. The Internet speed changes happened very late in the quarter. They were end of February. So we're continuing to really energize those markets with those things. We read a lot of stuff, but certainly the competitive environment doesn't -- there doesn't seem to be an awful lot going on there that we are not comfortable with

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Operations   [84]

And a big thing, Rob, as to what we do is education is a big thing. As customers call in and they got an offer from TELUS, we tend to walk them through on the benefits -- remember this, look at this, all the value adds that we bring. And often, they can make the decision right there of what they want to do

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [85]

And you know, we're seeing a portion that decide to stay with us

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [86]

And again, I think we -- don't we see that when you look at it, you go, okay, I can only have three TVs. They can only do this. But if I use the Internet and I want HD, and I don't have this product, all my stuff drops down. So we are seeing a lot of customers going, you know what, I am just not willing to make that choice, because you know what? My wife is on the Internet, or she's on TV and I'm on the Internet, and I'm not willing to make the choice to drop down at that service level

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Operations   [87]

Yes, and that's right. They want to maintain that higher service level

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [88]

Maintain the high levels, right? So we are seeing that, like, a ton

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Operations   [89]

And just one more thing, Rob. As we talked about dynamics and competing in the markets, as an example with SaskTel, they have a certain [MSB] product that we responded to and adjusted our products in a lower 2-megabit service, which we are very pleased with how we have adjusted to the market. So we constantly look at what is going on and adjust to it accordingly to make sure we are meeting our customers' needs in the market

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [90]

Yes, and it is kind of like all of that love, eh? Like, you know, that whole group here, we're going to have a group hug as soon as this call is done, and away we go

Peter MacDonald, GMP Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [93]

Can you just elaborate a little bit on the comments you made about Star Choice? Is it just a rebranding exercise, or is there more to it?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [94]

Were you talking about the hug? (inaudible) Brad, you -- or Jim or Brad -- Brad

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Operations   [95]

Well, we're looking at, when you look at the power -- recently, or I think about six months ago, we changed Shaw Tracking and Shaw Broadcast Services using the Shaw name. The power of that, the power of the brand, the name that Shaw has related to customer service and value, we've taken it to a different level. And looking at Star Choice, the opportunities we have, it was a natural fit to take the brand right across the country. And really, we think it is a real positive and just more awareness for the satellite products

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [96]

And also, to Peter, just no confusion for anyone. It is 100% Shaw. We are proud of it. We perform well. And we are part of the team. And we're going to take it to the next level

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [97]

Yes, that's good. That's all good

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [98]

Is there going to be a large rebranding cost, or is there going to be a slow change of the brand name?

Unidentified Company Representative   [99]

No, it will be a slow rollout. We will start with our employees and work our way out. But it's the same product, same company, same group, just a different name

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [100]

Okay. And then if I could just ask a question on the rate increases, I think you made some rate increases in DTH in this last quarter, but I have nothing in cable yet this year. Can you just elaborate on what was done on DTH and when your plans are for cable?

Unidentified Company Representative   [101]

In January, Peter, we did an average rate increase of about CAD3 to about half our base, which was very successful, low churn

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [102]

Jim?

Jim Cummings,  Shaw Communications Inc. - VP of Operations, Star Choice   [103]

On the cable side, we did a rate increase on April 1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [104]

And what is the equivalent of that on an annual basis?

Unidentified Company Representative   [105]

It will be about CAD4 million to CAD5 million per month

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [106]

Okay. All right, thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [107]

Listen, we've got costs, too

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [108]

Tim Casey, BMO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [109]

A couple of items. Steve, can you give us any guidance on what we should expect for cash taxes in 2010? You've talked notionally sort of closer to the CAD50 million-ish range for this year. How about next year?
  And on the regulatory front, Jim, this fee for carriage just won't die, and the broadcasters are in a pretty perilous financial position. And the Commission has a history of responding when people lose money. What sort of timeframe and how concerned are you that they are actually going to be able to get something through on fee for carriage?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [110]

Okay, so we will go with Steve, because he has this answer down pat

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [111]

So cash tax for 2010 are relatively easy. It's 30%. And you should assume that 30% is the true cash rate for taxes. There is no [PPA] or any other differences in there that would alter that rate. So that is what you should use for modeling purposes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [112]

And on the other regulatory issue, I am pretty well done on this issue. And everybody pretty well knows where I am at. But I'm going to let Ken or John jump in here, and they both can jump in and talk to it a little bit

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [113]

Well, we have gone through a number of processes over the past few years where we have proven to the Commission that fee for carriage is not a suitable policy to put in place or regulation to put in place. It just penalizes consumers. And people who propose it don't recognize the advantage that broadcasters enjoy in Canada with things like simultaneous substitution, priority carriage

So I think that part of the problem for the broadcasters is they have had to resort to increased spending on foreign programming and that they have engaged in other acquisitions which seem to put them in some financial situation. The bottom line on this is that they are trying to tax consumers in a whole range of ways. The CRTC is looking at increasing the local programming fund, but we believe -- we take our signal from the Minister, Mr. Moore, who revamped the Canadian Television Fund to make it more focused on audience success and openness and accountability. And we think that is the way to go in the future, is to emphasize on what is good for consumers rather than what is good for broadcasters

The bottom line on this is that we don't think that broadcasters should be looking at protectionist measures or taxes, but should be looking at innovative ways to grow the business. People still love television, and in other past recessions, it has been proven that people will embrace more television product, not less. So there's lots of opportunities out there, and we think that that's what they should embrace and not look at fee for carriage

So we will -- it is obviously going to be raised again through the over-the-air hearings, and we will deal with it in the way that we have in the past. It is not necessary, and it is not a good thing for consumers at all

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [114]

Thanks for that. Steve, just to go back to your answer, so that is a 30% effective tax rate, all cash, on pretax income. Is that right?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [115]

That is right, yes

Operator   [116]

David Lambert, Canaccord

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Lambert,  Canaccord Adams - Analyst   [117]

Just wondering how much your Campbell River acquisition contributed to revenues and EBITDA this quarter, and also, was that part of your sub addition?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [118]

It contributed a very, very small amount to EBITDA this quarter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [119]

(multiple speakers) nothing. Close to nothing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [120]

Yes, because the pricing there was designed for a cooperative. We haven't changed those prices yet. What was the second part there?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [121]

The subscriber adds, or the --

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [122]

The subscriber adds -- it was 12,200 approximately. And those subscriber adds were added to our opening figure. They're not included in the quarterly addition

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Operations   [123]

Yes, so not on the gross side, right? So you don't get -- we didn't just add them in

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Lambert,  Canaccord Adams - Analyst   [124]

Okay. And just one more question on the CapEx. I was just looking at your page -- I think it is 22, or sorry, 27 -- where you reconcile your CapEx. And I don't understand why you deduct the CAD20 million of proceeds from the disposal of properties to the CAD228 million to get to your CAD187 million. I thought you would probably add that back in, or it's already on the cash flow statement, investing activities. Actually, it is already broken out. So I don't know why you are deducting that. So the point here is, I think -- like, I get to CAD207 million, CAD208 million is what your CapEx would be as opposed to CAD187 million

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [125]

Well, let me say that our CapEx is actually very simple. There seems to be some confusion from a few quarters on this. So what the CAD187 million represents is the amount that goes off the balance sheet, basically. And what that is is assets that we've received and deployed or deposits that we have made or buildings that are under progress. The progress up to that point that's reflected on the balance sheet is treated as subtraction from free cash flow

In other words, it is actually a relatively conservative approach, because we don't actually show the payout. Obviously, you get it first; you pay it later. We show it as being effectively all paid out of our free cash flow as soon as it is deployed or shows up on our balance sheet

As we said, we spent CAD50 million last year to acquire additional property in Calgary, with the idea that we were going to sell the building this year [to our choice] and consolidate that. So the CAD50 million was in last year as an addition, and the CAD20 million that we received in proceeds this year is a subtraction from that. It's CAD20 million that has come off our balance sheet, and it is CAD20 million in cash that we have received

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Lambert,  Canaccord Adams - Analyst   [126]

Right, but it is already broken out in your investing activity. So shouldn't it not be in the calculation? Like, shouldn't your real CapEx be CAD208 million?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [127]

No. Well, if you are looking at it organically, if what you're trying to say is organically CapEx in the business was CAD208 million and then we received these proceeds, that is correct. Then you would say last year, organically, we didn't spend CAD725 million; we only spent CAD675 million, because CAD50 million of it was related to a one-time purchase of a facility

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Lambert,  Canaccord Adams - Analyst   [128]

Right

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [129]

It is actually a conservative and simple approach. It's what goes on to the balance sheet, based on what you've received, deployed or put deposits on. And that comes out of free cash flow immediately. And if you sell it and it comes off the balance sheet and you get the money, it gets added back to free cash flow

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Lambert,  Canaccord Adams - Analyst   [130]

All right. Okay, all right, that's great. Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [131]

David Gober, Morgan Stanley

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Gober,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst   [132]

Just had a couple of quick ones. Looking at the EBITDA margins in the quarter, it seemed like they came down a touch from 2Q last year, particularly on the cable side. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what the drivers are there and what the outlook for margins are going forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [133]

You are talking about 48.2% this year versus 48.8% last year. I'm not sure what all was in last year. (multiple speakers)

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [134]

You know, I think one of the things you've got to watch, again, you can't just go to one quarter to quarter. But generally, they are the same, like, you know --

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [135]

It's a very small difference. And one of the things to keep in mind as well is that this year, we are accruing Part II fees. Last year in the quarter we weren't accruing those Part II fees. So that's CAD4 million of costs that we have this year that doesn't compare to last year. And then of course, there's some additional costs in the business. But listen, 48.2% compares great to the first quarter and the 48.5% that we had for the entire year last year. And we will see some pickup, remember, in the second half of the year as the rate increase now moves through

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Gober,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst   [136]

Okay. And the other thing I wanted to touch on was just -- wondering if you guys could talk a little bit about the broadband ARPU trends and whether or not you are seeing lift there, and how that is breaking out between rate increases and improvements that you are seeing from usage-based pricing?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [137]

That's a pretty big question there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Operations   [138]

(multiple speakers) usage-based pricing, for one

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [139]

Yes. You know what, listen, we are consistent on rate increases. We are consistent on service delivery. And we are consistent on delivering better product all the time. And other than that, we don't see a lot of resistance, but we are going to continue to push the envelope. And if you think the telcos would push hard, we will push harder. Just -- we are that way. That is in our group. That is the whole group here. We are a light team, but we push hard

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Gober,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst   [140]

Adam Spielman, PPM America

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adam Spielman,  PPM America - Analyst   [142]

A couple quick ones. Just back to the balance sheet and the financing strategy, I understand what you are saying about not wanting to break any swaps against -- I guess it's the April 10 maturity. You have not issued in the US, I think, for a long time. Is that off the table, or is that something that you are still considering?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [143]

Well, listen, I will tell you, we just issued at BBB-. The coupon was for a five-year deal with 6.5%. If you compare that, Time Warner just came out with a five-year and 10-year deal. Their five-year tranche was all-in coupon of 7.6%, 110 basis points higher than ours. And they are rated BB+, which is two full rating notches above us

So we don't find anything attractive right now in the US. We always look at financing in the US and swapping back and what the costs are. It didn't make sense on this deal. And also, we just got a tremendous reception from institutional investors in Canada. A lot of people, even though we were rated by DBRS as investment grade, we were still split-rated because Moody's hadn't come out. When all three rating agencies came to investment grade, there were a whole range of new institutions that could buy us, and there was a tremendous amount of institutional appetite. And you know, what we saw is that there are a lot of institutions in this country who have been dying to own this Shaw story. And we have had a tremendous response. And I don't see why we would be quick to go to the US. But we do always look at it as an alternative

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [144]

And I'm just going to chime in here a little bit. Steve and his team have done a great job on the finance side. And you know what? In one-half an hour, we had CAD1.2 billion in demand. We only took CAD600 million. We could have taken CAD1.2 billion. We said no to that. We said this is all we need. We got a bit of a negative carry. We are okay with a little bit, but not too much, and move ahead. But, you know, I can tell you that we are market players, and we will watch our market. And one thing you have with Shaw, you have the best cable assets, some of the best cable assets in Canada

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adam Spielman,  PPM America - Analyst   [145]

All right. Second question, just remind me, have you said anything on -- just remind me what you said on 2009 CapEx, and then have you said anything on 2010 CapEx?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [146]

No, we haven't been specific on 2009 CapEx. I said there's a whole bunch of different moving things there with the rental programs, some things that we can advance. What we are being specific, though, on that, it's still our current view that we're going to generate CAD500 million of free cash flow or more. And you leave it to us to sort of juggle all those balls in the air to make sure that that happens

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Adam Spielman,  PPM America - Analyst   [147]

All right. Final one, just a macro question -- can you help us -- some of us down in the US? It does seem like there's at least two economies in Canada, maybe three. Clearly the West has slowed down, as Jim alluded to, but it is still my understanding -- I would like you to confirm it is still a lot better shape than, say, the Toronto area. And then is it different in Quebec or is that kind of more like Eastern Canada versus Western Canada?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [148]

You'd be asking the wrong dude. Last I looked, I looked at Calgary and then I've got a home in Southern Cal. (multiple speakers)
 So you know what? Listen, operator, we're going to close the call off today. We're about done here. So anyway, thanks, everybody, for joining. We will talk to you next quarter

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) The first question on the line comes from David Gober with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Gober,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst   [2]

Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A couple, if I could. I just wanted to see if you would comment on the priorities of wireless, and what the thinking is right now? And particularly given the state of the capital markets. You were able to raise some funds at pretty good rates recently. And I was just wondering if you would have any interest in raising funds to more aggressively build out wireless in the near-term given the spectrum that you acquired? And also on the digital side, I was wondering if you could give any sense of where ARPUs have been so far? And what the penetration has been like on HD and DVRs?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [3]

On the wireless -- there is -- we just -- we continue to be in the voyage of discovery, if you will. We continue to keep our eye on the ball with respect to what's happening with technology. We continue to look at what's happening with respect to towers and topographical kinds of requirements that would be necessary if our Company were to proceed. And so just as we did before we launched telephone, we did a lot of research. And we looked to the economics of launching that service, and when it was appropriate to launch it we did. And I don't think it will be anything different with respect to the way that we approach wireless. We continue to keep our eye on the ball, and when it makes economic sense -- then we would proceed. With respect to digital --

Unidentified Company Representative,  Shaw Communications   [4]

I think if you look at our digital ARPUs, we have suggested the new digital adds will have a digital ARPU marginally lower than our current CAD20 to CAD25 range. And numbers are still early, but numbers are consistent with that, only marginally lower. And we're certainly going to build that over time, and certainly the growth that we're getting in digital is coming from all spaces. It's coming -- HD continues to drive. HD DVRs continue to drive, our DCT 700 is a key part of the equation. So digital business is firing on all cylinders

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Gober,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst   [5]

Any sense of where HD or DVR penetration are either within the base or as a percentage of new adds?

Unidentified Company Representative,  Shaw Communications   [6]

Well, the majority of new adds under the digital rental program are the DCT 700s because that's our primary focus, and that's where we get the most bang for the buck. We do have a portion of them which are HD PVRs mostly. And that's sort of the direction that we'll be driving forward as we go forward to keep that same focus on the DCT 700

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Gober,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst   [7]

Great. Thanks

Thank you. The next question comes from Bob Bek with CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [10]

Good morning. Just on the TELUS Bell satellite TV deal. I think they announced that after your last quarter. Peter, can you give us a bit of commentary as far as how you view this within the competitive landscape in your territory for your cable and the bundled product that TELUS has against it? And extending from that, any comments that you might have on the Shaw Direct relative to this announcement from TELUS?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [11]

We really haven't seen any impact from the Bell TELUS satellite business yet, and it certainly I think is a commentary on their confidence or lack of confidence in their IPTV offering. And we have faced competition from Bell and very aggressive competition throughout our licensed area. And Star Choice continues to compete with Bell outside of our licensed area through the rest of Canada. And we don't see that it is going to have a material impact

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [12]

And as far as the satellite goes, do you think a new effort in Western Canada on the selling that product in addition to Bell -- no new issues?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [13]

We have as you know rebranded what was Star Choice now with Shaw Direct, and the brand is -- the Shaw brand is very, very strong, and in fact in Eastern Canada we have been doing some direct marketing with respect to 'Shaw Is Back', and we have seen some really good takeup on our Shaw Direct service. Shaw Direct being a digital video product solely, it is really important that the services that we offer in there are attractive to our customers. So we continue to add high definition services. We have recently dropped a few -- we'll call them nonperforming services. We have been notified the broadcasters of that, and we'll replace those with services that would have a higher attraction to our customers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [14]

While we're on the Shaw Direct, last question if I may, the Source acquisition from BC. I guess into 2010, that is a distribution pipe for Shaw Direct. Can you talk at all about the effect that will have on your distribution network if at all? And thoughts generally on that?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [15]

Maybe you want to comment on that, Jim?

Jim Cummings,  Shaw Communications - Vice President of Operations, Shaw Direct   [16]

Sure. Bob, we have been planning for this for quite a while. Our strategy is we have actually been moving a lot more sales into our Direct in-house. It gives us a little bit more control. Certainly they have been a big provider of us, or of our service and been a good partner. But bringing more inside provides more control, and also more quality. And we're certainly have prepared for that, and we don't see it damaging or hurting our service at all

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [17]

Thank you. The next question comes from Jeff Fan, Scotia Capital. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [20]

Thanks very much, and good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the digital rental program. First is, how -- do you have any sense of how long you want to keep this program going? Is there kind of a goal in penetration you want to reach, and then you start to scale back a little bit. And then secondly, maybe a question for Steve on the accounting. Just so that we're on the same page, the cost of all of these boxes going through the rental programs, you booking them all through the success base CapEx. Just wanted to confirm that. And if you can just break out the box component related to what's included in the success base. And then going forward, as you get the rental revenue, you're booking that through the operating revenue line. And just wondering if you can give us a sense as to how big that impact would be on a per-sub basis given the mix of boxes. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [21]

On the actual rental program and penetration objectives, as many of you are aware in 2011 the world changes with respect to digital migration and packaging. And there is a threshold that the Commission has established in that in their regulations of 80% penetration, that allows us more flexibility in the way we program or the way we package our services. And so clearly the 80% threshold is what we're trying to achieve in the near-term. And by 2011, we have said 80% is our goal, and that gives us a tremendous amount of flexibility in the way we provide digital services in a purely digital domain. In terms of CapEx and accounting, we leave that with Steve

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP &amp; CFO   [22]

Jeff, in terms of the cost of boxes -- you're right -- the cost of boxes, not the rental program, do go through success-based capital, and the rental income goes through EBITDA. In terms of the split on success-based capital between that and the internet modems and MPAs, I don't have that directly here. But we can come back to you with that number. And on a per-sub basis, I would say as a focus of most of the digital rental program is on the DCT 700s. We're looking at a cost of around CAD70, and we have been successful in generally talking about some of the self-install option that avoid a truck roll

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications - Group Cable VP of Operations   [23]

The 700 growth has come quite elegantly. It is a Canada Post delivery program. Customer goes on a website and sets it up themselves, plugs the co-axe into the back of the TV. So the cost of the program has really been the cost of the box which is around CAD70

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [24]

Sorry, what was that? CAD7 -- ?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications - Group Cable VP of Operations   [25]

CAD70 is the cost

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [26]

Seventy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [27]

Seven-zero, okay. And in terms of the adds that are coming through, what percentage are coming through the rental program? I imagine it is a pretty big number

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [28]

The majority

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [29]

The majority. Okay. Great. Thank you very much

Your next question comes from Greg MacDonald with NBF. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  NBF - Analyst   [32]

Thanks, good morning. While we don't get a chance to hear from J.R. often, so I want to take advantage of that. J.R., last time that you were on the call you talked a little bit about your outlook for the industry. That you thought it was still a great place to have major investments or a major part of your wealth. Could you give us a sense on what you think the maturity profile of the industry is right now? And what do you think as a result of, number one, maturing products and, number two, TELUS' entry? At least on a go-forward basis, a lot more focused on TV distribution. Does that mean that consolidation is inevitable for this industry, say in the medium-term, like a two- to three-year period?

J.R. Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO &amp; Vice Chair   [33]

Well, I go back a little bit further than I want to admit this morning in this industry. It is the only complaint I have ever had about the cable and the communications industry that we're participating in is that it is an extreme CapEx business. But now that we have more flows of revenue coming through the same pipe into the household, i.e., telephone, i.e., internet, and the success that we're having there, makes it more manageable from a Company point of view to have that cash flow to do that. Sure, the households are maturing. Basic cable is mature. And yet we continue to move them toward digital. We continue to move them in other ways. Look at Internet. When we started Internet in '95, we thought if we got 50,000 customers -- maybe 100,000 customers -- we broke the bank. And today, I think we're around 1.6 if I am not mistaken, million. And telephone has had the success. And I think a lot of our success is driven by our culture, and the can-do attitude, the willing to be team players, the willing to maneuver on a dime to meet the subscriber -- customer, whatever you want to call it -- expectations of us, and so I think those are the areas. One thing you mentioned about consolidation. I think consolidation is always there. When I started in this cable industry, there were hundreds of cable operators, just hundreds of them. And today there is probably five majors if you can get to that high number in the cable industry. And every now and then somebody decides to sell like Campbell River, or whoever else that might be, and so there is all of that kind of consolidation. Whether there is going to be consolidation in the big companies or not, that remains to be seen as to where they see their growth. We continue to not take our eye off the wireless ball because that is the future. That is a natural. We have the customers. We have the territory. We're in the West. We're strong in the West, and so we're going to be prudent. And as Peter has already mentioned this morning, we didn't jump into telephone too quickly. We could have jumped into it and done it with a twisted pair. We wanted to wait until the technology was there to use our own infrastructure and use it to the best of our ability. And it has just turned out exactly like we wanted to turn out. Now, will wireless be the same way? We're looking at our infrastructure to see how it will participate in the wireless industry in Western Canada. And we're looking at that all the time, and we will move when the time is right as we always have. Now, I am not sure I answered all of your questions, but sometimes when you get a little long-winded, you kind of forgot what the question was. (Laughter)

Greg MacDonald,  NBF - Analyst   [34]

You certainly managed shareholder capital very well over the years. That's definitely the thing that's highlighted on this Company. If you don't mind, I might want ask one quick follow-on question. You opened by talking about capital efficiency. That's interesting to me because the one thing that could continue to drive equity value in the cable industry will be leveraging that cable -- sorry, that capital efficiency. Do you think that that free cash flow margin potentials in this business -- that we have even seen the beginning of what that can be yet? Do you think that that can be a lot higher, and therefore, that could continue to be something that drives equity value?

J.R. Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO &amp; Vice Chair   [35]

Well, even though I have never liked the CapEx portion of it, CapEx drove our growth -- the quality of our service and everything else about it. So it is kind of good and bad to the story, and it has been really terrific from that point of view. And, we haven't pulled back any reigns on CapEx any place that I know of. And I just think that we have come to an area of topping that CapEx in my opinion, and I hope that is correct. As more revenue keeps coming and so forth, it will turn into revenue generating free cash flow or whatever else it is. And that means more for the shareholder. And my view on buying back shares and on dividends and so forth -- I like to buy back shares. But I haven't seen how that touches a shareholder -- directly. Where if you give them a little bit of dividends, we pay it monthly. And they see that coming into their bank account on a monthly basis. So I think this industry in the future will drive more free cash flow than it has in the past

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  NBF - Analyst   [36]

Thanks for your opinions. Always appreciate it

 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [37]

The next question on the line comes from Vince Valentini with TD Newcrest. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [39]

Thanks very much. We can talk about free cash flow in the here and now rather than in the future. You had another phenomenal quarter, and, Steve, you seem to be trending to do quite a bit better than CAD500 million, not just slightly over CAD500 million. I know you still didn't pay any cash taxes this quarter. Maybe you can give us an update on how big that outlay could be in the fourth quarter? Maybe that's why you're being cautious? But if I just take what you did in the fourth quarter last year, add it to what you have done year-to-date at CAD405 million, I get up to about CAD550 million of free cash flow for this year. Can you tell me why that is an unrealistically high estimate?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP &amp; CFO   [40]

You are accusing me of being conservative. We will pay cash taxes in the fourth quarter. I would say the high-end of that range right now is about CAD50 million. The other thing is, we have got a number of pressing capital programs that we're looking at both toward the end of this year and next year. And we plan to continue with those. And so to the extent that we see some opportunities that cash tax number would be lower. It would be our intention to proceed with some of those capital programs because they are necessary spending. As to the extent that we can do it sooner, the sooner we do it the better. And so that's why I would still say our target is to come in in the low CAD500 millions, taking all of that into account

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [41]

And will those CapEx projects potentially be starting to do something in wireless? Or are you talking about just cable stuff?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [42]

No. We're really focusing as we said on core business. And so some of the things that we're trying to do is, as you know, we have launched [DOCSIS] 3.0 in some of our communities, and we'll continue to do that through the remainder of the fiscal year. And there is a cost to doing that. We continue to really focus on segmenting our nodes so that the service levels we give our customers continue to be able to scale with the growth that we have seen in the Internet. And in order to do that, there are some fiber -- strategic fiber builds -- going to take place. And of course, we'll continue to do the success-based growth on our digital which will be a part of our core focus, if you will, as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [43]

Okay. Thanks

Thank you. The next question comes from Peter McDonald with GMP Securities. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  NBF - Analyst   [47]

Thank you. Mr. Shaw, just a couple of follow-ups. When you talked about the wireless, is that a change in view on wireless? And when you say it is a must-have, is it a must-have in the sense of network extension of what you have right now? Or do you think it is necessary to have wireless handset offering?

J.R. Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO &amp; Vice Chair   [48]

I think wireless is becoming more important, not just for voice, but for all modes of communication. And particularly when the spectrum becomes available, and just think if we follow the American scene where they take back the television spectrum, and then put it out for data, et cetera, and communications, that is a big area. All I was trying -- that's a big future area -- and we are not taking our eye off that ball. But I think what I was trying to say is that we want to spring off our infrastructure that we have to be the most efficient, and we can be in light of the future wireless operations that we want to have

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  NBF - Analyst   [49]

Thank you. If I can ask a regulatory question. Can you comment on the Heritage Standing Committee's decision to turn down the fee for carriage? Is it now dead, or are you negotiating something with the broadcasters as has been speculated? And if it is not fee-for-carriage, should we be assuming there is some other cost that the cable industry is going to have to bear as a subsidy for the broadcasters? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications - Group Cable VP of Operations   [50]

We're very happy with the committee report, particularly we would point out the government members' filed a dissent because they felt the committee had not dealt with the issue directly enough. And to quote the government members, they said that we must indicate our most fervent and rigorous opposition to any potential fee-for-carriage system either negotiated or imposed. So our view on this is that there is no need to have negotiations on this issue. That the important issues will be dealt with in terms of the hearings in front of the CRTC, and however the government decides to deal with the issue going forward. The July 6th announcement by the CRTC will come up with a context for the over-the-air hearings which will be held in September. The CRTC has denied fee-for-carriage twice in the last three years. The broadcasters have gone MPs. They failed with the MPs. So I imagine now they'll try the arguments again with the CRTC, and we think they'll fail once again. We don't think it is in the interest of cable and satellite subscribers to pay a fee for services that are available free to people over the air

 Greg MacDonald,  NBF - Analyst   [51]

Okay. Thank you

Operator   [52]

The next question comes from Dvai Ghose with Genuity Capital Markets. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [53]

I would like to readdress the wireless question with Mr. Shaw, if I may. I can understand why you waited with VoIP. It was a relatively new technology in the early 2000s and so on. And you want to make sure it worked and so on. If that's really true with wireless which I think has iterations and upgrades, but it is a 30-year-old product in Canada. I am not sure if there are any major technological changes which are going on. And by waiting, aren't you carrying some risks here every day penetration rises. Every other new entry in your territory will launch ahead of you. And substitution may roll up before you're actually ready to fight it with a wireless product. Isn't there some risk in delaying?

J.R. Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO &amp; Vice Chair   [54]

I guess there is risk in delaying, or whatever you do. We do have a portion in our CapEx this coming year that we will address some of the updating ourselves. And both from a backroom point of view and from a system point of view, as to where we should be going and so forth, so we're not broadcasting it big time. It is significant dollars. We will spend that to analyze what's going forward. We understand that the newer systems are coming into place, and possibly they might become more secure with the customer. We do have a strong base here in Western Canada. We do have significant customers here in all forms of this. And we think that when the time comes, we will put forward such an offering that we'll be able to gather up as many customers as we would like to have at that time to do -- to make this a viable business along with what we have already got

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [55]

I understand. A couple of other quick ones if I may -- more micro. On the Star Choice side in the quarter we saw a very significant 364 bps increase year-over-year in margin. I assume part of that is because of reduced Part II fees? You had extraordinary fees last year, but it can't just be that. How did you get such a great margin improvement?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [56]

We're not allowed to call it Star Choice device

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [57]

Sorry, Shaw Direct

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 J.R. Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO &amp; Vice Chair   [58]

Good management

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP &amp; CFO   [59]

A portion of it is -- remember we booked CAD4 million last year in satellites for the Part II fees that related to previous quarters. So a good portion of this, I mean, on CAD184 million of revenue, that's about 2% there alone is representative to that [tool difference]. So if you adjust for that, the margin last year would have been 35.5%, and we've gone up to 36.5%. So I don't think that's -- within the rounding here, if you will

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [60]

That's fair enough. That's good. On the cable side, you had 13% growth in total RGUs compared to the end of last year. 10% growth in revenue. Is that just a timing issue because you added a lot of people toward the end of the quarter? Of course you released two-month figures so you did show some good sequential growth in May. Or is that because of lower ARPU from incremental customers? And what does that mean for margins?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP &amp; CFO   [61]

I am not sure how you equivalize all the RGUs there, Dvai? So what was it? It was 13% in RGUs and 10% in revenue

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [62]

Right

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP &amp; CFO   [63]

It could be partly timing. And it could be just the equivalization of, as you say, some lower ARPU customers coming on as well. And particularly the digital rental and the additional rental through the entire quarter. 110,000 coming on very quickly in the course of one quarter won't have an immediate revenue impact

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [64]

Right. Good point. Last one, really two quick ones, which are just factual. I understand that you're not particularly fussed about the TELUS satellite threat. Satellite has tended to do better in less urban markets -- outside downtown cores. What percentage of your cable base do you think are outside that downtown core market where satellite has been very unsuccessful?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [65]

In terms of the mix between downtown core tech customers and rural, we're probably 65%-35%

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [66]

So 65% downtown core

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [67]

No, 65% out in the rural areas

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [68]

65% rural. Okay. Thanks. The last one on the factual basis, the source --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [69]

Dvai, just to be clear, we're talking about satellite there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [70]

I am sorry. I am talking about -- of your cable customers -- what percentage are in rural area which is are more susceptible to satellite competition versus urban?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [71]

It is probably 90%-10%

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [72]

90% being urban only -- ?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [73]

Downtown, yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [74]

That's why I was surprised. Okay. Good. The last factual one with the source -- obviously Bell has alluded to the fact that it is a big distribution for Shaw Direct as it is now called. Can you give us an idea what percentage of gross loading comes from the source?

Unidentified Company Representative,  Shaw Communications   [75]

In the past we have seen between 1,200 and 1,300 new activations per month

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [76]

Okay. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Operator Instructions). Bob Bek, CIBC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [2]

Thanks. Jim, could you perhaps talk a bit about the Mountain Cable acquisition and some of the rationale for that move East and other plans you might have as far as strategy on trying to expand where possible

And I guess for Steve, I think at the time of the announcement, it was talked about cash and perhaps some Class B shares. Has that been firmed up at all as far as how the transaction was financed?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [3]

Well, I guess on how the transaction works -- so it's CAD300 million -- I cant remember -- CAD700 million? CAD300 million -- something like that?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP and CFO   [4]

Just over CAD300 million

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [5]

Just over CAD300 million. And the economics, Bob, prove out really well for us, and it's a really well-run operation

We already operate in Ontario, and Rogers had passed on the acquisition. And so we decided to go in there. And basically given our current financial structure right now how we sit, we -- this is a great move for us. I mean, to come in there, to be able to start being around that market, and which is -- we always said that here, this would be my father, myself and my brother, said, and Peter said, that you know what, we want to be in Alberta, BC and Ontario. And that's where we wanted to be

And that's why we exited Nova Scotia and we felt that these were the have-to-do provinces of Canada, and they would always be. And you know what, we should just fly over all the rest

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [6]

Now given that there's only a few tuck-ins or obvious tuck-ins related to that in Ontario, is it going to be difficult to do more at least in size? I know there's a little bit left in Hamilton, but is there other opportunities we're not looking at?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [7]

I don't -- we take them as they come, Bob. This is a good -- you have to look at this one. The opportunity became available to us. It's well-built. There are synergies, particularly on the telephone and fiber inner connection side of things, and you just take one at a time

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [8]

Okay. And just on the financing, Steve, or is that firmed up?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP and CFO   [9]

About the -- the family has an alternative to take a portion in Class B shares. They've indicated right now that it will be around the 40% area. But we will be truing that up before closing. And our intention would be that we would go into the market and probably buy those shares back

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [10]

Right. And then you know what, it got approved yesterday, right?

Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [11]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [12]

So it's all approved, so we've just got to come up with the structure. So that will take us about a week to come up with that, Bob. And then we will know exactly the details, but you know what, if they take the shares, we're probably going to go back in, as Steve said, and just take them out of the market

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [13]

Okay. That's helpful; thanks. I guess since I'm first up here, I will ask the big loblaw question on wireless. Can you update us on where you stand as far as your wireless interest and where you are with the spectrum? Thanks. I'll leave it there. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [14]

Well, you know, that's always a big interest for everyone

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [15]

I thought I'd get it started anyway

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [16]

You know what, in this interview sitting with the boys around the table here, that's what they'd be saying too

But I'm the one that keeps pulling them back. But I think that on wireless, that you know, we're going to do a little more probing, a little more probing, a little more detail, and we don't really have a total plan right now. But I can tell you we're really interested in expanding into that area on a really cautious basis. Because we think that having all those [connicks] will just make us stronger

And so but I can tell you that we will be very, very cautious here, really cautious, you know, to make sure that we don't lose any shareholder money, and this and that. And you know, the family has a lot of shares so they're really, really watching this too. So just, it will be a careful approach. I can tell you that

Greg MacDonald, National Bank Financial

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [19]

Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. The question I have is on the dividend. The last couple of years, it's been very good growth. I think you are one of the strongest on the TSX. But, things are changing a little. Cash taxes are a reality now. Possibility of CapEx with wireless at some point maybe. Cash compensation on the Mountain Cablevision deal

I wonder if you might comment on whether that suggests the dividend is going to be on hold for a while. And really what I'm asking is how you think about the dividend. Is it a function of what the near-term free cash outlook is? Or do you think what your free cash flow profile is going to look two or three years down the road in terms of how you plan for dividend growth?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP and CFO   [20]

So Greg, our view on the dividend is that steady increases are what's important here. We've obviously come very fast, very far, and you wouldn't expect us to continue at that rate

As of the early part of this week, we were ranked number 10 out of the TSX 60 in dividend yields and number 23 out of the TSX 300, so are well up there at this point

But we recognize the dividend needs to continue to increase at a steady pace. The Board had a discussion yesterday about the dividend increase for this year. We decided to defer that until the next quarter. We will review it again, but we do expect that the dividend will go up this year in line with that philosophy of just continuing to grow at a steady pace

And as we've said before, we've been targeting dividend increases on an annual basis roughly around the level of EBITDA growth

And I'll also say to those people that are concerned about the constraint in the dividend, that this year even with this sole cash tax burden, we're giving you guidance here of CAD500 million, which is consistent with last year, which is really quite an accomplishment. Our current dividend rate is CAD360 million, so we've still got CAD140 million of room below the free cash flow level right now to increase the dividend, so we're not tight, and I don't expect that we will be tight as the business continues to grow in the future, even to the extent we may acquire those investments. It's just a matter of the steady increase as she goes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [21]

And you just tapped some pretty cheap money, so you've got flexibility there

Can I just verify, when you say we'll look at increasing it this year, is that fiscal 2010 or is that calendar '09?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP and CFO   [22]

No, that's fiscal 2010

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [23]

Okay. And just a quick follow-on, any evidence yet of TELUS TV, either IP TV or satellite?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Operations   [24]

Hi, Greg. It's Brad. As you know, TELUS competes aggressively on their promotions. And to date, we haven't seen really any material impact on the core cable business. We believe they have some challenges on the technology. They have some installation challenges that they are going through. And, we haven't seen any real big impact. And as you know, they will continue to compete on price, which reiterates our point that this is really not a differentiated offer from what they claim it is. So no impact as of this quarter

Greg, this is Peter. We wonder sometimes why [you're usually] in the business where you are basically every time you sell a product you're actually taking a loss on that product

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [27]

Some might suggest that it's a strategic product, right? You got to do it to save access lines

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [28]

Well, it hasn't been working that well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [29]

Okay. What about the satellite side of things? I assume, though I don't know for sure, that they'd be targeting the more rural customer. Have you seen any evidence there of competitive activity?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [30]

Hi, Greg. It's Jim. We've actually seen virtually no impact on the TELUS TV product

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Operations   [31]

And that would be same for cable. It's -- Bell was in the market; TELUS was in the market too, but we haven't seen anything that would say boy, this is significant or it's really changed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [32]

Okay, that's helpful. Thanks, guys

Phillip Huang, UBS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [34]

Thanks, a lot. First, just the question on your EBITDA guidance. With 8% organic EBITDA growth and 14%, including CRTC and Mountain Cable, my rough math works out to be about CAD90 million. And based on I guess CAD2 million per month of CRTC, I'm guessing half of that CAD90 million difference relates to CRTC, and the other half relates to Mountain Cable. So I just want to run that by you to see if it's reasonable

And the second question is on free cash flow guidance comparable to 2009; was just wondering what your assumptions were on cash taxes, if we should think about it as being similar to '09 tax expense? And if you expect any sort of significant proceeds from disposals that might help offset CapEx. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP and CFO   [35]

Well, I'll try and go down that. So in terms of the impact of the Part II fees and EBITDA, they are approximately CAD75 million, and we're assuming about CAD25 million in EBITDA this year from Mountain Cable. So that's how you get from the 14% that we stated down to; as we indicated in the guidance section, the (technical difficulty) organic growth

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [36]

Got it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP and CFO   [37]

And then, in terms of -- what was your question on free cash flow again?

Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [38]

Yes, so, I was just wondering the assumption behind getting to free cash flow of, I guess roughly CAD500 million for fiscal 2010. In terms of assumptions on cash taxes, can we sort of think of it as being similar to tax expense in fiscal '09? Or, and if there's any sort of proceeds from disposal that you expect to have in fiscal 2010?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP and CFO   [39]

No, there's no proceeds for disposal expected in CapEx. And in terms of the cash tax rate, you should be using 30%. And that's a fully lowered rate because we've been using our TCA as we go on booking that, so we don't have unused TCA here, so it's actually at statutory rate

For cash taxes, you should be coming in somewhere in the area of CAD250 million to CAD280 million, roughly. And in total, for interesting cash taxes, you should be in sort of the CAD450 million to CAD500 million band. And if you're outside of that, probably something is wrong with the calculation, so you might want to take a look at it

We also indicated the stock option. So for fiscal 2010, on a prospective basis in the past we've been treating the Black-Scholes cost of stock options as a cash item and a deduction from free cash flow

As you all know, the Black-Scholes accounting number for the expense of stock options is typically that; it's never a cash number. It could never turn into a cash number, so we are adjusting that next year. We're not adjusting it in EBITDA. We're adjusting it in free cash flow. And you would expect that to be about CAD18 million for next year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [40]

Great, thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP and CFO   [41]

So let me just -- Just at this point, just let me step back and say one things in terms of the guidance before we get too much further into the math

Is one of the things I think everybody should keep in mind here is that excluding that one-time Part II fee recovery, excluding the year-over-year impact of the cash taxes, which is well, well over CAD200 million. And excluding that change in stock option treatment that I talked about, the CAD18 million, so take all those effects out, the free cash flow that we're generating in this business rose next year by close to up to CAD150 million over 2009; which is directly a result of business operations and also the acquisition of Mountain in there. And that's almost 30% growth

If you look at last year, you can do those numbers as well. It was a pretty significant growth rate. But that is I think a great accomplishment and great that you can see us actually coming in here with a full cash tax burden and telling you that we can keep free cash flow at the same level as last year

Jonathan Allen, RBC Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [44]

Thanks very much. First question on CapEx spending for 2010, just looking back in 2009 it looked like you'd been spending a little bit more than usual on things like buildings; you done the DOCSIS upgrades or at least a large part of it; and you've done a big ramp-up on the digital side

So just in 2010, perhaps you can just give us a sense of what some of the drivers are there, because presumably, things like building costs will come down. It sounds like you are close to finish on the DOCSIS side. So I'm just wondering what are the items that are going up in there?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [45]

Jonathan, hi; it's Peter. On the digital initiative, we will continue to really focus our energies in that area because we got such a benefit in the long term with respect to the experience of our customers. And so that's going to be a driver

On fiber, there are some strategic fiber runs that we are going to be building next year that allow us to offset some of our cost of IRUs or leasing fibers from third parties, and which will provide us with a greater redundancy and reliability for not just our telephone services, but also for our video-on-demand and digital services

Of course, we announced earlier on that there is some over wiring and construction taking place in British Columbia, and that's a new initiative that we announced just a few months ago; that's in around the CAD10 million, so that will certainly occupy

And remember last year, we also had a recovery on capital as well from the disposal of the start Star Choice building, and we saw direct now, and so that creates a difference in the delta. And then we do have some facilities activities next year, one-time facilities activities to enhance our -- essentially the ability to house some of those new employees in our engineering and Shaw Business Solutions areas

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [46]

Thanks, Peter. But when I look across both businesses, it looks like the CapEx to sales ratio in 2010 might be something around I guess 21%. And I'm just curious where you see that going over time, whether you see the core cable number coming down to somewhere 17%, 18% over time?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [47]

Well I know that that's certainly what the experience has been south of the border there, in that sort of 17, 18% range. And I guess alternately we could reside below 20%

Right now, we're in a very competitive business, and we want to make sure that when our customers make the conscious decision to come to us, that we reward them with really exceptional service and a reliable service. And in our view, running the Company right now, these are really high-priority services that make for the long-term growth opportunities in bundled services and new broadband type services

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [48]

I think, Peter, that when we look at it, you know we're the number one most profitable cable company in North America. I don't care who you pick, we're number one. And in doing that, we just need to have enough fiber, Brad and the boys need enough [stock] to just keep it running. And we are also really good at managing our capital and our corporate side, right?
  So I think that when you look at it, I think that we've gotten a lot. We produce a lot. And for our shareholders, we deliver a lot, right?

Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [49]

Thanks. Steve, can I ask a quick clarification question of you? Now that you've done the debt refinancing, it looks like you've still got about the CAD400-plus-million of FX swaps outstanding on it. Was the plan to actually close those out at some point? Or were you planning to run those as I don't know, a hedge for CapEx spending?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP and CFO   [50]

Well, what we've done, Jonathan, so we've taken out all three issues. And on the April 2010 and April 2011 issue, we've essentially crystallized and prepaid the swap principal amount at maturity. So we're leaving the float outstanding because we always need US dollars and we have this cross-currency liability anyway. So we may as well just leave it as a natural (inaudible) against our US short. But in terms of the principal amount, for the April 2010, April 2011, we've taken those out

And the reason that we prepaid them early is that we were able to get a very good discount rate on those. And so it was more sensible for us to prepay them than to hold the money (technical difficulty) and pay them at the time. And so that's about CAD290 million. And what that leaves outstanding is, on the December 2011, the swap principal amount as that maturity, we've crystallized that at about CAD160 million. But we haven't prepaid that amount

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [51]

Okay. Thanks, Steve

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP and CFO   [52]

So effectively then, just to put that in a broader context for people listening, we eliminated (technical difficulty) all of our refinancing risk through the next three years. So the next one that comes up is the CAD450 million debt that's in November 2012 three years from now. The only other thing before that is just that CAD160 million of swap liability in December 2011. So we've taken all that out at a great coupon of CAD565 million, which will be a core piece of our capital structure going forward for the next 10 years

Dvai Ghose, Genuity Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [54]

Thanks very much. Not to belabor the free cash flow calculation question; I think you've given us some good guidance there. But just want to clarify, does it include the Part II fee reversal or not, because that's a non-cash item, right?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP and CFO   [55]

It does include the Part II fee reversal. Because remember that our free cash doesn't include working capital

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [56]

Right

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP and CFO   [57]

So we set up a provision, for example, for a contingency that essentially gets booked into free cash flow as if it was paid at that point. So when we were accruing the Part II fees over the last three years, they were essentially showing us reductions in free cash flow, even though they weren't true cash items. And now this recovery will be our recovery back into free cash flow

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [58]

Right, even though -- but there's not going to be a cash impact because the funds are never actually held in escrow; is that correct?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP and CFO   [59]

Right, but that's --

Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [60]

They were just nominally held in escrow?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP and CFO   [61]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [62]

Okay, great. And then I just wanted to clarify as well that there's no material wireless build in your free cash flow guidance either?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [63]

No. Give me a sec here. I think that we're starting to continue to explore our wireless build, but there would be no material builds. But there is starting to be a lot of interest here to start the [sports] play

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [64]

Okay. On that point though, Jim, is there an added urgency because independents like Globalive and DAVE have spectrum in some of your key cities in the West and are threatening to launch unlimited voice as well as data plans?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [65]

No. I would say it would be the other way around, where, that you know what, you know now with the Mountain acquisition, we are the largest cable company in Canada. And, then if you add in the satellite play, we're even larger. So, for us to move into mobile is not really a big deal, like in, if they are in there we don't really care because we already have a relationship with all the customers, and they have zero. So what relationship do they have with a customer? They don't have any relationship. We have, I don't know --?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Operations   [66]

3.4 million customers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [67]

3.4 million customers that we have a relationship every month with, right? And they have zero. So, are we scared of them? Not a chance

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [68]

Fair point. Last one, going back to the Mountain Cablevision, you made a good, compelling case as to why you wanted the asset. Rogers, obviously, not very happy, tried to take you to court and all of that sort of good stuff. So I can understand all is fair in love and war and it's a limited footprint as far as Canada is concerned; you've got to buy what you can buy. But, and whether there was an agreement between you and Rogers or not is kind of historically irrelevant

But if all let's say yourselves, Persona, Cogeco and Rogers are all going to go head-on in terms of any future acquisitions and bid aggressively against each other, aren't you just jacking up the price for buyers and making it really enticing for sellers? Because these acquisitions -- the last one you did about 7,000 per sub; the previous ones you did in Western Canada are about 3,500 a sub, so just night and day in terms of valuation?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [69]

You know, I think that when you look at it, we are over wiring in Delta right now, which is a really good economic position for us, because they've laid off all the management and all that kind of stuff. And we of course tried to purchase them, but they weren't willing to sell. So I don't know where it's all going, but --

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [70]

You know, it's very cyclical. There will be sometimes you'll pay more for a system. When we bought Whistler Cable, we paid a little bit more for that system mostly because of the attributes of that system and (multiple speakers)

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [71]

That's true, Peter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [72]

Great. No, that makes --

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [73]

And you know what, we wanted to -- Rogers had passed on buying the system twice, and Hamilton, and so we came in and bought it. Then they marched, they were mad that we bought it, but that was their call. They made the call. And so I think that it's just bringing this back to Ontario, which is a place we really like, a place I was born at, that kind of thing. So you know, my dad is from and my grandpa's from and my uncle is from. And so we just kind of like said, okay, but let's toe her back in

So you passed and then now you're mad that you passed. So that's their issue, not my issue

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP and CFO   [74]

But just to put it in perspective, and you agree with this as well that the 7,000 for a sub misleading here. Given the high penetration of digital to high penetration of Internet, it's hard to use that statistic as effectively. And also the fact that it's an 860 megahertz system, 100 homes per node; it's a tremendous asset

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [75]

Yes, yes. And I think when you look at the financials, which you don't get to see, when you look at them, it produces, you know, a substantial amount of cash flow to justify the price. We aren't heavy buyers. We aren't like guys that don't know how financials work

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [76]

Absolutely. It's totally your asset

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [77]

And there are rate upsides in that system as well that we will take advantage of; those are all opportunities. And people look at us when we bought Campbell River that we've taken the multiples out from I think about 20 times down to 11 times. Within the year, with respect to the -- because of the growth that we've seen through the initiatives that we have undertaken in Campbell River

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [78]

No, no, fair point. Maybe one day you'll buy Rogers instead of the other way around. Thanks

Glen Campbell, Banc of America

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BAS-ML - Analyst   [80]

I just wanted to follow up on the last question. Dvai asked a question about why Mountain Cable. And Jim, your first sort of comment and response was over building in Delta. And I'm thinking you had the option of buying this asset on any set of numbers; it's double-digit EBITDA multiples. You could have bought back your own stock at 7 times

So from a shareholder point of view, we scratch our heads and think why do it? And you talk about being in Ontario, but it's only 40,000 subs. The only kind of rationale that it makes sense from my perspective on is that it gives you a base to overbuild your neighbors. So can you talk about whether that's something you would ever consider with that asset?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [81]

Well, you know --

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [82]

Well there are some areas where we actually have joint license overlaps which have not been wired, and so there are opportunities for us to expand into new territories irrespective of -- I mean we are licensed for those and those represent an opportunity for growth

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [83]

Yes. Well, I think that you know when we look at it, there's not that many ways to grow in cable. It was another like kind of linchpin that stuck us back in that market that Rogers had passed on and so we went back into that market. And we felt that there is some good growth there. There are some companies on the edge that maybe we would acquire, maybe not. I don't know, we will see. And that when we looked at the system, it produces pretty good stuff, right?
  And so we are having a hard time saying no. And when we looked at it, every time we went down there and you know, my dad went and [Shay] and my brother went and Peter went and Steve went. You know, when we looked at it, then we came up with yes, was the answer. Yes was the answer every time. And --

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [84]

And if you also understand that we weren't the only ones that saw the value in those systems. (multiple speakers)

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [85]

No. The weak link or east link or whatever they're called. There were three other bidders --

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [86]

There were three other bidders that were all within 1% or 2% of the value that ultimately prevailed. And so they saw the same things that we saw

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BAS-ML - Analyst   [87]

Okay, fair enough. Thanks. I had a follow-up as well on the small business opportunity. You've put up really good sub numbers for the year. I'm assuming there is some small business in there in terms of the Internet and the phone customers. Can you talk a little bit about how big small business is in your revenues and subs now? How much CapEx is going there and where you might like to take that?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Operations   [88]

Hi, Glen; it's Brad. Well our focus has always been and continues to be small to medium home office. In our market, we believe there's close to 1 million businesses across our footprint that we have access to. And as you know, we continue to grow that strategic plan. We continue to see nice steps as we continue to bundle the triple play in the business. So we are seeing that as a good opportunity

And as you know, Shaw Business Solutions really takes that enterprise business and grows that at more the high end and the big guys, and they are having good success. So we're comfortable with our plan, but certainly see it as a big growth opportunity in the future

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BAS-ML - Analyst   [89]

In the numbers you've reported, are there a significant number of small business customers in the phone or Internet subs yet?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [90]

It's Jim. I think it would be fair to say there's significant phone growth in the small-business sector in the numbers last year. I don't think you would consider the Internet and television business in fiscal '09 to be major changes from previous years

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rob Goff, Haywood

 Rob Goff,  Haywood Securities Inc. - Analyst   [93]

Thank you very much. First question would be on the digital. Do you believe that the success in '09 is stable through 2010? i.e. can you keep up that pace of roughly CAD100 million a quarter? And can you refresh us on the incremental revenue COA economics with the digital?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Operations   [94]

Hi, Rob. It's Brad. Yes, we actually are very excited about our digital rental strategy. The return on capital on a small 295 box and DCT 700 is very good business, and we certainly see us growing in that range as we hit 70% and beyond over this next year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [95]

Brad, what about the -- are you just going to expand the program to HD, and DDR?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Operations   [96]

Yes. We just started this past quarter and we're just getting out the door and (multiple speakers) and stuff, and that's -- you are seeing -- as we look at the digital rental strategy, that mix will change, so that's going to -- that will have the capital in flex on the subsidies (multiple speakers)

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [97]

So that would mean that the number would hold, right?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Operations   [98]

Yes. Well, and there is movement; (multiple speakers) manage in doing that, so

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [99]

Yes, I think you're going to see the continued execution of the plan as Brad says. And in terms of how our new customers are spending, they are spending phenomenally well transactionally. On-demand revenue per new digital rental customer is actually higher than the base. Our focus has been on pretty [eloquent] deployment of digital into the marketplace, and so we are not deploying the boxes with a lot of subscription revenue on it day one

But the beauty of the model is it's a good story in the current quarter. It's a much better story 12, 18, 24 months. As with the digital in the household, we're able to drive subscription and increasing bundles. So we see a nice story here, both short term and long term

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Operations   [100]

And just add to that, part of the strategic plan is looking at how we seen it grow at HD VOD, which really ties nicely into the rental program. And it's very competitive out there, and we're going to find differentiators to ensure that Shaw continues to lead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [101]

I think that's why we launched those new channels and all that stuff, right? And we're going to continue to drive to have new products that other people don't have, and they will have to catch up to us

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Haywood Securities Inc. - Analyst   [102]

Thank you. And if I may, a follow-up question on the Mountain Cable. Would it be fair to say that 12 to 16 months out, you'd be on a single-digit EBITDA multiple, i.e., pro forma moving the telephony in house away from Allstream, etc.?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [103]

I would say yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [104]

That's one of our synergies, of course, is moving into our own telephone network, into our own fiber backbone and into our own condominium, so that we are not relying on anybody

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [105]

And that's happening right now, right, Peter?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [106]

Yes. So we've already interconnected them to our fiber, and we're moving traffic onto our own switches as opposed to having a third-party switch

 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [109]

Thanks. Just a couple of quick ones. First on subscribers, were there any promotions in the quarter that would have helped them subscriber loading? And if not, is there anything we can read into the economic stability from the number that you put up?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [110]

Nothing unusual, like, right?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [111]

No, I think promotional activity moves a little bit and so does win back and saves as we continue to adjust as the competitor moves around. So you're going to see those things move, but nothing that would -- jumps out at you and says that's significant

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [112]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Operations   [113]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [114]

Okay. And then the second side is on the cash, when I look at the debt that was raised and the rest of it, you mentioned in there that you'll use it for a number of things, including acquisitions. But if I run through the math, and you tell me if I'm wrong on this, after you account for the Mountain Cable acquisition and the paying back or the buyback of the debt that you did and then the swaps that are outstanding, you don't really have a lot of cash left on the balance sheet at the end of that. Is that correct?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP and CFO   [115]

That's correct, Peter. I think we have CAD100 million, don't we? No?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [116]

Oh my God, we've got to get some more money. (multiple speakers) get us some money

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [117]

That's why we're acquiring through the over wiring

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [118]

Oh, is that why, Peter? Okay

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP and CFO   [119]

So essentially, the economics of taking out that debt were very efficient. We took it out. We took out those swaps early, as I said, because we got a great discount rate on that. And we've got CAD300 million today cash, which will essentially be used to fund the Mountain acquisition, as we get, because we'll buy the shares back there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [120]

Okay. And the comment that was mentioned potential acquisitions, that's just an open-ended comment. There's nothing that you have on the radar screen that you've identified?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP and CFO   [121]

No, we've effectively already used the proceeds for all of the redemptions and swap redemptions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [122]

Okay

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [123]

And the acquisition of Mountain and all that, right?

On the cable side, Brad, can you just clarify that the rate increases you've done recently, would those be across all your systems equally, or is there any difference in your pricing or promotions in the markets where TELUS TV has the broadest and oldest footprints like Calgary and Edmonton?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Operations   [127]

No, it was right across the board and averaged about CAD3 per customer. There was no market that was untouched

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [128]

Great. And Jim, on wireless, you mentioned you want to get in there but you are very cognizant of doing it without putting shareholders at big risk and you will be very cautious with it. And I certainly appreciate that sentiment. It would seem to me that the best way to do it on that basis would be to partner with somebody who already has a wireless network. And you guys have the great customer relationships and the great sales ability. Is there any reason why you can't be a wholesaler of Rogers' network and achieve all the benefits without the big CapEx and without taking all that risk?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [129]

You know, those are all just I'll call them discussions that will happen. Okay? And so the boys here don't want me to commit to any certain plan, but we're starting to start to consider moving out into the wireless agenda. And how we do that, we are just working on. So I can't really give you a firm answer, Vince

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Operations   [130]

We're aware of those benefits too

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [131]

We're aware of those benefits and I think Rogers is aware of the benefits. I mean it would seem to us when we [yacht] that if Bell and TELUS can get together, do something together and what, Shaw and Rogers can't? Like, what's up with that?

Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [132]

Good. Okay, I appreciate that. Thank you

Jeff Fan, Scotia Capital

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [134]

Thanks very much. My first question is on wireless. In the review that you guys have done in looking at the market opportunity, your services that you maybe want to offer down the road, can you maybe comment on the capabilities of the spectrum that you have, being AWS spectrum, 20 megahertz? So maybe comment on the quality and the quantity that you have and their ability to deliver the things that you want to sell through that in the future? Over time, not maybe in the immediate future but over time

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Michael D'Avella,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Planning   [135]

Jeff, it's Michael. The 20 megahertz AWS spectrum we have is very good. There really are no issues in terms of our ability to provide services or do any of the things that you might think about in terms of out of an HSB build or an eventual LTE build. There's a lot of momentum in the vendor community with respect to AWS because everybody knows they're eventually going to have to use it, so we're quite comfortable with the 20 mg

With the bonus of time as more spectrum becomes available and we're actually in a business that we like, we will probably acquire more. But there's no point kind of thinking about those decisions at this stage right now

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [136]

I guess if we factor in the economics of building on that, like in terms of the number of cell sites that would be required, I'm not asking you for details. But if you consider the economics, would you say that it's still as good as other spectrum that's being used for 3G or LTE services down the road?

Michael D'Avella,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Planning   [137]

Well most of the incumbents are using their cellular and PCS spectrum, I think in terms of the HSPA builds, the 800 megahertz and such. Obviously, that's better from a cell site construction perspective. But if you think about the communities we serve and where we actually need to be in terms of footprint coverage, we're in pretty good shape with AWS. I don't really see any huge deficiencies here. So I wouldn't say this is a disadvantage

And if you think about all the advantages that we have in terms of being able to actually interconnect sites, provide fiber backbone, everything else (multiple speakers)

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [138]

Customer base

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Michael D'Avella,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Planning   [139]

Customer days

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [140]

Towers; we already have towers. We have a lot of stuff [to play]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Michael D'Avella,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Planning   [141]

Yes. I mean we have a lot of assets that we can bring to the table here once we -- if and when we decide to get going

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [142]

And Jeff, John here, just to add on Michael's point. The new technology, HSPA and LTE, our band will be a core band within that technology, so I think there will be lots of equipment for us and we will be able to [start on] that equipment at competitive prices

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [143]

And I also think too one of the things that we have a big advantage is, as you know, we have 650,000 [qualms] of fiber, that we can truck traffic around like crazy. Like we do on the Internet and that's why they'll make it work really well for us, and the cost will be low

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Michael D'Avella,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Planning   [144]

And the existing broadband experience

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [145]

Yes, and the existing -- yes, and the customers and all that kind of stuff, right

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [146]

My second question is something that you had touched on, Jim, on the last response about Rogers and Shaw, you certainly sound like you thought about it. Care to elaborate?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [147]

I don't know what you're talking about

No. I mean listen, I think that what we want with Rogers is a relationship that works for both of us. And certainly we had a couple of issues on Mountain Cable, and we got through those. And you know, the team here we'll be meeting with Nadir and Edward, and I think that's really positive, and I think there's lots of positive things that the companies can do together. And I think we should have a strong look at that. That's kind of what I feel, and I am sure the Rogers guys are on this call. But I think we have to have a strong look at it

I had a strong relationship with Ted, and now he's gone. And now we are just developing our new relationship with Edward, and with Nadir. So that's kind of where we're at

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [148]

 Ben Mogil,  Thomas Weisel Partners - Analyst   [150]

Good afternoon. In terms of the CRT Part II fees, can you break down what percentage are sort of allocated towards satellite, what percentage were coming from cable?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP and CFO   [151]

Yes. It's CAD50 million from cable and CAD25 million from satellite in the recovery

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ben Mogil,  Thomas Weisel Partners - Analyst   [152]

Okay, thanks. I think most of my other questions have been asked already. Thank you very much. Oh, sorry. One more

Is it going to all come back in the first quarter or is it going to be spread throughout the year?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP and CFO   [153]

No, back in the first quarter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Ben Mogil,  Thomas Weisel Partners - Analyst   [154]

Operator   [155]

David Gober, Morgan Stanley

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Gober,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst   [156]

Thanks for taking the question, guys. Just a quick one on broadband. I think that along with the [regular] rate increases in September, you also took some broadband rate increases. Just curious how you think about that over time and whether or not that's going to be the route that you continue to go down in terms of regular rate increases or whether usage-based pricing makes sense over time just given overall Internet usage trends?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [157]

Well, you know we haven't really experienced a lot of pull-back from the customer level on the rate increases. And I think that if you compare them to US models, I think we're still pretty light, and I think we continue to see that there's going to be growth in that area

And it's all about value. We've continued to increase the speed of our Internet, and so the experience that goes with that speed warrants the kind of rates that we charge for our Internet

But there's a negative connotation also associated with usage-based billing. It's more complicated. And one of the things that we've always found as providers of services our customers is if we can keep it simple, then our customers couldn't understand it, whether it's the way we price our phone product, the way we price our Internet and our bundles; that customers are drawn to that approach as opposed to saying well, you used 3 gigahertz per second and it's going to cost you CAD1.42, and then you end up with all sorts of dissatisfied customers that say, well I only paid CAD1.41 yesterday. And that adds complexities to relationships so we keep it simple and positive

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Gober,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst   [158]

Okay. And I think Jim alluded to this a little bit, but it seems like you guys have been gaining share in broadband on the customer side pretty consistently over the last year or so. Is there any reason why that would change? And I guess any color you could kind of give on why you guys think that's been happening?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [159]

Well, I think that the team here, Brad and his team, Jay and Jim and all those guys, have been really working on bringing on new, products, so we've been really focused on bringing on new products. And so that would be the biggest differentiator for us than other people. That we go, we want new products and we want them now. So you don't know [Diver Dan AM]; what is it, Brad? Tell me the products. What are the new ones?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Operations   [160]

The new ones for --?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [161]

Well, we've got -- so we did three DOCSIS 3.0 so 100 megabits. What other channels did we bring on?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [162]

New Lite

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Operations   [163]

Yes, we quadrupled the speed of Lite this week to 1 mg. We know we've launched 100-mg Nitro service across the board. We've launched -- continue to add new products in all categories (multiple speakers)

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [164]

(multiple speakers) And then we launched HD, (multiple speakers) History HD

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Operations   [165]

History HD. (multiple speakers) absolutely. We launched Prime Time On Demand. So we've got 15 of the top-rated shows available commercial free and on-demand included with your subscription. We have an awful lot of activity on the product side

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [166]

Yes. So I think it's been really, really positive on the product side to just see how we push hard, and it's really, really worked well for us

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Operations   [167]

And no doubt, at the end of the day, speed makes a difference, still does in the service. (multiple speakers) differentiator and as TELUS struggles to get bandwidth on the DSL platforms in the home, we're going to continue to make sure that we have the high speeds. And people want -- they want snappy Internet; they want good service [with the] amount of video and content that is coming on there, they're going to (multiple speakers)

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [168]

Yes, and I think the other thing, you know, I mean to be honest, I think the telco guys have a lot of union issues. Guys slowing them down, and we don't have any of those, and we just start cranking it harder

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Operations   [169]

That's why we have the Accelerator

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions The first question comes from Vince Valentini with TD Newcrest. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [2]

Thanks very much. First thing is on the VoIP and HSD customers, very strong growth once again. I suspect that business customers are still in the mix there. Can you give us some color on maybe how much of the growth is from business versus consumer now and what you're doing in that market and maybe give us some glimpse as to what kind of revenue you're getting from business customers now and what the growth profile is?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - CEO and Vice Chairman   [3]

Thanks, Vince, it's Brad. A couple things. When you look at the VoIP adds I think you can look at it both 10,000 for the quarter was related to business. It's a high growth area for us, we have a lot of focus on it and going forward, we see that next couple years as a big opportunity for Shaw in sales growth. And also when you look at it and you look at TELUS with the rollout of IPTV and the satellite product across our footprint, that and also combined with our focus on high value customers, we did experience some good growth in those product categories and it just goes to the complement of how strong our product offering is in the triple play

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [4]

Okay. Just a follow-up on a separate topic. Can you give us any further comment on wireless partnerships and any discussions you may have had with other players to help you get into that business, either easing the burden on the funding side or some people who can bring some strategic perspective to it? And if you care to comment on the new precedent that's been set for foreign ownership by Globalive, is that something you'd think about for your wireless business is to bring in a US carrier as a partner and try to create a separate JV subsidiary that you could have a significant foreign interest in using that same template?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - CEO and Vice Chairman   [5]

I think, Vince, when you look at it we're probably focused more now on just making sure the platform works correctly, on equipment suppliers how we source that, how we operate the network, billing, those kind of issues that are really more fundamental. And we feel that the partnership thing will come when the time comes and that could be anybody from Bell to TELUS to Rogers to a US partner given the recent decision on Globalive. I don't think we're at that stage yet. And certainly as you know, Shaw doesn't need any funding so it would be a question of whether they brought something to the table that would be of help to us like maybe tower sharing or equipment sharing or something like that. So I think we have a lot of questions that we're just pouring through

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [6]

Okay, that's good, thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [7]

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Allen with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [8]

Thanks very much. Jim, I think I saw some headlines coming out of the AGM earlier today. I think it was a question about Canwest and some of the assets came up there. And there was an article earlier this book saying Shaw was recognized to look at the broadcasting assets. But I think today you made some comments about maybe being interested in the newspaper assets. Can you talk about that a little?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - CEO and Vice Chairman   [9]

I can't really comment on that but I can tell you that newspaper assets were not ever in discussion. But that I think we will always keep our options open. We have not decided what we would do but as you know, they're all in bankruptcy there so certainly it's something that we would consider given what Comcast is doing to enhance value but only if we saw it to enhance value to the Shaw shareholders

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [10]

And a different question. Looking at the basic subscribers for the quarter, a small loss of 1.4 thousand but just curious, is this primarily to TELUS TV? Was there something in particular in the quarter that was worse or should we get used to a small negative number run rate going forward?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - CEO and Vice Chairman   [11]

I don't think we're prepared to talk about the crystal ball going forward. To your question on the quarter, for sure we had increased competitive activity. TELUS is available throughout our footprint. We also had a conscious shift in our own focus with the competitive television services available across our entire footprint. We put our focus on triple play and achieving growth through the triple play numbers that you've seen in our other subscriber category

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [12]

But would you say most of the competition was from TELUS as opposed to satellite competition?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - CEO and Vice Chairman   [13]

We would say most of the competition was from TELUS including satellite competition. So if you're trying to differentiate between what TELUS is doing with their satellite play as opposed to their wireline play, cumulatively that would be the majority of the change

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [14]

Okay, thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [15]

Thank you. The next question on the line comes from Glen Campbell with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [16]

Thanks very much. On wireless, I just want to get a better sense of the timing of your decision to press the button on wireless. We've got Globalive now set to launch in your territory, and another competitor, DAVE, that's raised funding to do so. So from that point of view the timing seems a little bit surprising. So I was wondering if you could tell us what's change there. And also you mentioned that you'll just be doing preliminary preparations during the current fiscal year. Could you tell us what you're hoping to get done by the end of the year on that, thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - CEO and Vice Chairman   [17]

Just when we talk about it, we've talked about whether it's time to hit the gas, not hit the gas. I think that we weren't the first on the Internet but have turned out to be the best at Internet and the most profitable. So we're worried about cost structures and that. We bring a lot to the party given that we're the largest video provider in Canada, with 3.4 million subs, so we're larger than Rogers or anybody else. So we bring a lot of customers to the party. I think we're just taking a careful approach and making sure that if we do do anything we make the right move off the start

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [18]

Okay, super, and a couple of just quick follow-ups, as well. On the rate hike that you took on September 1, would it be fair to assume that the benefit of those is entirely in the revenue numbers for this quarter or should we expect a little of that to bleed through to the second quarter? And then on interest expense you said in the MD&amp;A you said you expect a benefit of roughly CAD35 million from refinancing. That math makes sense but I just wanted to confirm, does that exclude the interest cost on the most recent debt issue that you did, the CAD650 million which would seem to basically negate that benefit? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - SVP and CFO   [19]

Well, no. What we were saying there is that as a result of the higher price US data issues we took out, the redemption cost in total for the whole, all of the financing that we did, were CAD80 million but they generated run rate savings of CAD35 million in lower interest expense. Could you give me the first question again?

Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [20]

Just to clarify, that was just on the 1250 that you raised to refinance those but obviously you've got interest costs on the 650 you raised after; is that right?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - SVP and CFO   [21]

Yes, that's right

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [22]

Okay, the first one was on revenues and cable and satellite. Would it be fair to assume that all of the benefit of the rate hikes for September 1 is in the quarter's revenues or should we expect to see a little bit of that bleed through into the second quarter?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - SVP and CFO   [23]

75% of the rate increase in cable is in the first quarter and 100% of it is in the first quarter for satellite

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [24]

Super. Thanks very much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [25]

Thank you. The next question comes from Dvai Ghose with Genuity Capital Markets. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [26]

Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Very strong cable revenue growth but the margin was down about 140 beeps year-over-year. Is that because of the strong growth and expenses associated with the change in revenue mix? Does Mountain Cablevision have lower margin than Shaw?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - SVP and CFO   [27]

No, it's certainly not because of Mountain Cablevision. In fact, Mountain Cablevision contributed almost CAD3 million of EBITDA in the quarter. We had a few things going on this quarter compared to last year. Obviously, you know that our salary increases all take place in the first quarter of the year. We had some additional marketing and sales in the period. Part of that as well to do with fee for carriage. Remember that we're absorbing the LPIF, so in the quarter for cable that was the CAD4.4 million expense and for satellite it was CAD2.6 million, and then we had some other one or two little items that were small items that contributed to the lower margins. We would expect through the course of the year that we would see those margins come back up to more normalized levels and that's where our forecast today and that would be consistent with our guidance that we've given you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [28]

That makes sense and the LPIF is passed on but is essentially zero margin, is what you're saying

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - SVP and CFO   [29]

The LPIF we're absorbing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [30]

Oh, you're not passing it on?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - SVP and CFO   [31]

No, it's not a separate line on the bill, we're absorbing it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [32]

Sorry, I didn't know that. Okay, great. If I could ask you, sorry, going back to wireless, you must be sick of it already, but the thing that's strange, as per Glen's question is you raised CAD650 million to finance wireless, you probably have a negative pretax interest carry of about 5%, there's about a CAD30 million-odd burn. If you just sit on the cash it doesn't seem to be that conducive on a financial basis let alone all of the other stuff that's been referred to about penetration increasing, competitors getting in the market, wireless substitution plans. So if you're taking such a gradual approach why did you raise the money upfront I guess is the question?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - CEO and Vice Chairman   [33]

When you look at it, there was a board decision, and Steve and myself and Peter and Brad, to have the money so we have the capability of doing it any time we want and then we don't have to rely on having a partner and not having a partner. And I think -- how long was that money, Steve?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - SVP and CFO   [34]

It was 30 year money at 6.75% which when you take that on an after-tax basis it's about 4.7% which is close to our dividend yield. So when you consider the possibility of locking that in over 30 years at that rate, and that's helped contribute to a reduction in our cost of capital for the calendar year from just under 7% to just over 6% in the issues that we've done. So yes, there is some negative carry in the short-term but the offset is that by locking that in now and locking in 30 year money when you can get it, it doesn't take a lot for rates to go up for you to breakeven on that investment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [35]

Okay, fair enough. Opportunistic, I understand. Last question is, so you have the capital, you've done very well in terms of getting into new businesses like VoIP, you have the largest TV subscriber base in the country, why do you need a partner?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - CEO and Vice Chairman   [36]

That was the question that we've already answered is we don't need a partner. We're not ruling that out, but we don't need a partner. If you'll recall, this is like deja vu for us, before we lost our telephone service, we were getting the same kind of questions about why we were lagging in terms of some of the other people in the industry. And we said at the time that when we launch we will make sure we launch properly, that we maintain our brand integrity and that we were confident that we had bundling partners because we had at that time many many Internet and basic cable customers but we wanted to insure those customers, in fact, took our options, took the new services and that we didn't damage those services that already existed. We're taking the same kind of steady approach to things and don't think that we're not looking at what's going on. Don't think we don't know what vendors are out there, what facilities are available for sharing, what roaming opportunities are there. So we don't have our head in the sand. We're doing something. It's a very very competitive business, and so to the extent that we can be somewhat stealth like, we'll be that way

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [37]

Makes sense. Thanks very much

Operator   [38]

The next question comes from Tim Casey BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [39]

I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about your view on content. You said you're not ruling out Canwest and you're going to frame any deal in terms of value creation. But yet Comcast has went deeper into the content game but Time-Warner has went the other way and separated content. So there's by no means a universal view out there and I'm just wondering how are you approaching content going forward given that there's so many more over-the-top applications that consumers are very interested in? I don't want to frame it in terms of the free for carriage decision but do you expect that your basic video content, being the cable channel, do you expect those costs, you'll be able to keep a lid on cost control there?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - CEO and Vice Chairman   [40]

Our deals, and MD can talk about it a little more, are pretty long term. And as far as content, right now we're producing 9,000 hours of local programming in our markets that we deliver to our subscribers every -- I don't know. That's annual. So we are producing a lot of content already. It's a little more local and so we're going to continue to focus on local content and that will be our driver. And as far as our transactional deals, Michael?

Michael D'Avella,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - SVP Programming   [41]

Tim, our discussions with program suppliers, whether they're broadcasters or specialty services or cable channels, or studios, they include a broad range of items. And where we can, we are certainly negotiating for VOD rights, we're certainly negotiating the broadband rights and those broadband rights are essentially what you would refer to as over the top rights. We already have a lot of those rights. We're in the process of developing our own portal, if you will, for distribution of this programming, so all of the stuff is being, it's in the works. We're very mindful of the over the top business, the rights market in general and quite frankly we're in the best position to actually do all of this stuff, As Comcast would certainly attest to in terms of TV everywhere in the US

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - CEO and Vice Chairman   [42]

Michael, would you say that most of our deals with programmers are in the five to seven year range?

Michael D'Avella,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - SVP Programming   [43]

Yes, we've got a lot of long term deals, Jim, that do protect us in terms of the core offering but we're also very interested acquiring those ancillary rights so these discussions are going on all the time

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [44]

There's a view among some people that sports represents a PVR proof content. Would you ever consider investing in some of the western based sports properties to retain that as an exclusive content?

I have a deal with the Chairman who actually is JR who's my father that we are never allowed to buy a sports team. So, that's a personal deal between him and I. No one knows it but now you do

Operator   [47]

Thank you. The next question comes from Jeffrey Fan, BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. (Technical difficulties) We'll move on to the next question from Tim Casey

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - CEO and Vice Chairman   [48]

Tim has already asked

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [49]

My apologies. Next question will come from David Lambert. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Lambert,  Canaccord Adams - Analyst   [50]

Thanks. Just wondering about your price increase, if given that the market seems to be getting a little bit more competitive on the video side, if you gave consideration to actually not putting a price increase this year, and what are your thoughts going forward here?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - CEO and Vice Chairman   [51]

The first thing is that we're going to cancel our phone service from TELUS here, because the speaker phone, the conferencing center doesn't seem to work. But I'll let Brad or Jay go ahead with that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - Group VP of Operations   [52]

I think where our pricing is continually under review, I think it's pretty difficult to take a rate sheet approach to pricing these days. We continue to do regular price increases, we do all kinds of things that add value through bundling and what are really price reductions through triple play bundling in a competitive environment, promotional pricing is a piece of that. So I think you'll see a continuation of the pricing strategy that overall that led to our strong revenue growth in Q1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Lambert,  Canaccord Adams - Analyst   [53]

Great, thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [54]

Thank you. The next question comes from Jonathan Mendosa with UBS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [55]

Hi, it's actually Phillip Huang from UBS. Can you hear me? Just going back to Mountain Cable, obviously the cable revenues re-accelerated this quarter partially helped by that. Was wondering if you might be able to tell us what the organic growth was in the quarter?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - SVP and CFO   [56]

As I said, Mountain Cable represented about CAD3 million of the EBITDA increase, and for the year, we expect to be in the CAD25 million to CAD30 million range for EBITDA

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [57]

And on revenue on the top line?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - SVP and CFO   [58]

I don't have the top line handy, but the margins are similar to ours so you can do the math back up

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [59]

And just a quick clarification on free cash flow. Does it include the CRTCC recovery in the Q1 free cash flow number of CAD160 million?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - SVP and CFO   [60]

Yes, so what we're doing is you can see we're providing, for analytical purposes, we're taking out the Part 2 fee when we discuss EBITDA because obviously, growth numbers like 29% don't make a lot of sense. So we're trying to help people analytically to understand what the EBITDA is without that. But one of the things you have to understand is because working capital is not part of our free cash flow definition, we have been essentially treating the Part 2 fees over the last three years as if they were paid. They came out of EBITDA or they come out of free cash flow every year, so this year, we effectively are recovering those as a cash item. If you had included working capital in the way some others would have done it you wouldn't have actually shown any reduction of free cash flow over the last three years and when the recovery comes, you've shown zero, as well. The point, though, is that the free cash flow over the last three years has been reduced by CAD50 million on an after-tax basis and so we need to add it in this year or it just disappears forever for continuity purposes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [61]

Got it, okay, that makes sense. And just finally, I think you mentioned in the past that there's about CAD18 million of adjustment for stock option expense adding back to free cash flow this year. Just wondering where that number is included in this quarter or is it lumped in the latter quarters for this year?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - SVP and CFO   [62]

If you want a reference point, you can actually see on page 37 of the press release, there's a line there on the Statement of Cash Flow that shows stock based compensation which for this quarter is CAD4.4 million. We expect it to be CAD18 million for the year. And the point of that is very simply that most people, or very many people, start from cash flow from operations for their free cash flow definition which already adds back non-cash items like the stock option expense. Remember that the stock option expense is the Black Scholes expense which could never be cash. So we're just making an adjustment to bring ourselves in line with our peers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [63]

Got it. That's helpful, thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [64]

Thank you. The next question comes from Jeff Fan with Scotia Capital. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [65]

Thanks very much. I've been waiting so long I forgot my question, but no, I actually do have one. It's related to your digital TV penetration. It looks like you have 60% right now of basic subs penetration, pretty much around the same level as a couple of your peers. Just wondering if that pace of digital penetration growth should continue as we look forward given the TELUS TV competition with digital being a way to compete against TELUS TV?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - CEO and Vice Chairman   [66]

Jeff, it's Brad. We certainly see competition continues to heat up. We still see tremendous momentum in our digital strategy as we drive forward to 70% and beyond. So as we stand here, we're looking at opportunities where we can enter with a low cost HD box and a variety of other tactics to continue to drive the business and insuring that we have the proper content and packaging that customers want. So it's a constant view for us to look at it but we're certainly pleased where we are and we see that momentum going forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [67]

And then maybe a quick follow-up to the margins question from earlier. I understand there are some one-time items that's impacting your Q1 and that margins could come back up sequentially. But if we look at how your revenue mix impacts your margins, assuming that your Internet and your phone services have high margins and are bringing high incremental EBITDA, should we continue to see a bit of a headwind related to what's going on in the TV side with the transition to digital?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - CEO and Vice Chairman   [68]

First of all, phone margins and Internet margins are above our average cable margins which is very strong and that's where you're seeing a lot of the growth. On the digital side they are below, but our view is that even if the margin comes down a little bit as a result of that mix shift, on an absolute dollar basis you're still growing EBITDA and on a year-over-year basis that's going to contribute to absolute dollar EBITDA growth. As Brad said, the rental strategy is working very well for us. We're now generating recurring rental streams from the rental boxes themselves. We're seeing much heavier transactional activity on VOD and pay-per-view from rental customers than we have from our traditional customer base, as people begin to explore. As Jay had said last time, once you get an interactive programming guide it may take a little while but it's a self-advertising feature and so we expect to see further improvement as customers add service going forward. So it's all being a net positive for us and it all contributes to overall absolute dollar EBITDA growth

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [69]

Okay, and one last quick one, on the broadband side. Are you guys charging for overages on Internet and whether that's a material amount at all on your Internet ARPU?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - SVP and CFO   [70]

No, we're not charging. You're not charging

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [71]

Any possible change going forward in terms of cap?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - CEO and Vice Chairman   [72]

I think it's something we've looked at and have explored but right now, our Internet numbers are so strong and our growth is so good that we think we have the right model and we just continue to add speed value

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [73]

Okay, great. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [74]

Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to you, Mr. Shaw

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - CEO and Vice Chairman   [75]

Thank you. See you guys next quarter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [76]

Ladies and Gentlemen, that does conclude the Conference Call for today. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a great rest of the day.

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) Dvai Ghose

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [2]

Thanks very much. Just a couple questions on your wireless. I guess [you raised CAD650 million] with use of proceeds, including bundling wireless at the end of last year. You've talked to -- and Videotron sort budgeted CAD500 million plus excluding spectrum, and your footprint is about 10% bigger, I think. So can you assume -- I know there's CAD100 million earmarked for this fiscal year, but that the overall capital requirements would be in the CAD600 million range? Would that make sense?

Unidentified Company Representative   [3]

Dvai, you're on the very high end of that range, and I think that -- as you have seen us in our previous launches of telephony that we take a staged approach to the deployment and that, as we stage our deployment, we take all things into consideration, including free cash flow, uses of capital expenditures, where we can maximize the infrastructure, what technologies we are using for the deployment of wireless. And so we're -- we said CAD100 million this year, and I would think that over the next few years you'll see investments slightly higher than that but not much higher. And we are all about execution and managing our capital resources, and that certainly is part of this plan

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [4]

I think that, you know, we have this huge fiber backhaul (inaudible) a lot of facilities that we already own, and even given the CanWest transaction, all the towers, a lot of fiber, and so it looks to us like we're in pretty good shape here

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [5]

I agree, but that's why I was comparing it with Videotron; it has some of those advantages as well. But on the balance sheet, one of your key successes in terms of stock price and investor sentiment has been your dividend increase. I think it's interesting the way you sort of posed that you raise the capital for wireless, it's a separate balance sheet from the core business. I think that makes some sense. So does that mean that you see -- given that your leverage is pretty low at about two times EBITDA, given the strong EBITDA growth that you're generating, do you see room for other dividend increases while funding -- from the core business while funding wireless from the bank -- from the credit lines that you've raised?

Unidentified Company Representative   [6]

I think, if you look at it that way and separate it and say (inaudible) we've got cash in the bank to be able to fund wireless, and that would be the same treatment as if we were buying a wireless business today. It wouldn't come out of free cash flow from continuing operations. When we look at our continuing cash from continuing operations this year we've got more than ample room to be able to support our dividends at CAD500 million cash flow from continuing operations and a dividend run rate of CAD380 million. That's significant room. Bearing in mind also this year we are bearing the full tax burden, so we'll see further increases in that next year. So there is certainly room here to increase the dividends, although we will take a cautious approach in doing that and managing all of the various factors that are in front of us here and the opportunities that we have in front of us over the next few years

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [7]

Makes sense. Last question then I'll let others ask. As far as other cablecos are concerned, I mentioned Videotron obviously getting into wireless as planned this year, EastLink out east. I've seen Rogers in a different position because they're the incumbents; they're already in your markets. But do you see any cooperation between those other two cablecos and yourself?

Unidentified Company Representative   [8]

Go ahead, Michael

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Michael D'Avella,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Planning   [9]

The only one of only any real scale here is obviously Videotron. They've got an entire province. So once they build out and assuming the technology's are pretty much on the same platform, there would certainly be roaming opportunities. And you are familiar with the evolution of technology in the industry, everyone essentially heading to an HSPA plus LTE platform. So there could be some opportunities. The bigger opportunities are likely to be in the US, as some of the US guys begin to figure out what they want to do on the wireless side. And, look, I mean, the wireless business, as you know, is all about interconnection and having the right roaming arrangements and partners and so on sort of outside your own territory. And we are very encouraged by all the developments in AWS. So we think there's going to be a very strong ecosystem around AWS handsets, devices, and technology deployments

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [10]

Yes, and the only thing that Michael that like (inaudible) and all these guys are all willing to yap with us and move forward or not move forward, whoever your partner is. But there are ways to talk and have approached us like crazy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Michael D'Avella,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Planning   [11]

Yes, that's absolutely right, Jim

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [12]

Thanks very much, and best of luck in the wireless business

Operator   [13]

Bob Bek, CIBC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [14]

Jim, I have a big picture strategy question I guess. Another very strong quarter for cable, great sub growth again and even some margin gains in what appears to be a more competitive environment. My question is can you first talk about that environment. Is it true it is getting a bit more difficult out there, and notwithstanding your numbers in the quarter? And given -- will that be more difficult in the second half of the year to start to keep that momentum? But, given the success you've had in cable, why the change in tack on wireless? It is still a measured approach, but I think previously you talked about wanting to take a look at the other players coming in, take a look at the environment, see where the pricing comes and before sticking your pin in the ground. So what out there have you seen that brings you to get more aggressive on the planet?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [15]

I guess we'll go to the cable thing second. I guess that we looked at it and (inaudible) said, these guys are only like one player in a market that will have control of four entities. So we will have that. So (inaudible) Michael and Peter talk about these things, but we are going to have pretty well the whole gamut across, and how can that not be positive for Shaw? And I just don't understand. So -- but I'll let you guys start

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [16]

Sure. Bob, just to answer on cable, we've -- competition is intense, there is no doubt about it, and we take things seriously. I think when TELUS made the move to do the resell with Bell, increasing their IPTV footprint, it has really changed really the market from a single play to a triple-play offering. And for our focus of creating long-term value and all that that comes with it with ARPU and everything else has really been our focus. And you're seeing that in the results. So that's what I'll say. And, of course, we expect it to continue to get more intense as TELUS launches with their new platform and Microsoft 7, which we've seen from MTS. And we've certainly got things in the hopper to address that. But we are very comfortable in the position we are and we are going to keep our hands on to the business and we'll see how that goes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [17]

Okay, thanks. Just back on the wireless side, Jim, your spectrum, I guess you have 20 megahertz across your territory, which should be plenty in the early days. Are you concerned at all about really building a big platform when you've got -- you really would be at a spectrum disadvantage I guess until you look ahead to some auctions perhaps for the 700 megahertz if you want to get bigger. But any thoughts on the spectrum disadvantage to TELUS for us?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [18]

The only thing internally that we have enough spectrum to launch a solid, solid service. And I think all of us here would vote yes. Right? And I mean once we cross like, I don't know 1 million customers or 0.5 million, I can't remember the number -- what was it? Peter or Michael?

Unidentified Company Representative   [19]

It's going to be well over 1 million. But, Bob, bear in mind, the 20 megahertz was faster than the AWS band that's kind of unencumbered by old technologies and legacies, is a lot of spectrum. And if you look at the footprints with the US guys, AT&amp;T, Verizon and others, they tend to have either a little bit less than that in terms of the AWS spectrum, or the 700. And they are building entire business plans around LTE with less spectrum

But the game -- as this business grows, and it will grow and it's going to be a significant part of the business in the future, you're going to need more spectrum. But we've got two auctions coming (multiple speakers) [5] and 700. And we are going to argue quite forcefully that those auctions should encourage a new competition as they did in the last one. So we'll see what happens when those rules are set

But what's changed in wireless, just to get back to your first point, just adding on what Jim said, is that this is now a broadband wireless play. And fundamentally, the smart phone penetration, the growth in smart phones and the growth in broadband wireless devices, whether they're fixed, mobile or whatever, has made this different. So we've got 1.8 million, roughly, data customers that were the dominant player in our territory. And those customers are going to want some level of portability, some level of mobility, and it's incumbent on us to ensure that we've got the platforms to carry this stuff across

So -- and technology has matured. LTE is going to be a much better technology than HSPA once it's fully deployed. And bear in mind that there will be a very, very robust ecosystem around LTE. And there will be all kinds of devices that have those 4G capabilities. So waiting is actually not a bad thing. It's the right thing to do

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [20]

And think of it in the context also of our current infrastructure and the things that we can do with the wireless product to make that wireless product even more bandwidth-efficient through utilizing in-home routers and our own broadband infrastructure to provide that kind of access on a wireless basis as well. So we are already quite excited. As Michael said, we've benefited now from waiting for two years to the point where our technology that we are going to be deploying will be the world-class technology, leading-edge technology

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [21]

And, Peter, don't you think that -- or Brad or whoever, Jay, or whatever -- don't you think that they are coming out with one product, and we are going to offer four products to the home. And how can that not be more successful than offering one product?

Unidentified Company Representative   [22]

Yes, so [Wind] (inaudible) is wrong on its own. With no existing customer relationships, it's just a passing wind. (multiple speakers)

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [23]

(multiple speakers) to the Wind guys that are on the phone, we are sorry

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [24]

That's a lot more answer than I expected, but thanks very much. I'll leave it for others

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [25]

Vince Valentini, TD Newcrest

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [26]

Thanks very much. I want to stick with wireless if I can. In that last answer, are you alluding to the fact that you may go straight to LTE, given the timing here that you've waited, or are you talking about HSPA first?

Unidentified Company Representative   [27]

Well, we haven't made the call yet. We are still evaluating totals, we've got the RFP essentially in the final stages of being responded to. So what we do know is that the vendors are ready, so we can make this call in probably the next little while in terms of what we actually end up doing. But we are not going to make a call right now

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [28]

And so, you should know that the design is actually done, and so all the wheels are in motion in terms of design, site collections. We are doing all of those things. And the last piece of the puzzle is how much of the core network will be LTE capable and it's what the rest of the network looks like when we come out of the gate

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [29]

And, who will be the vendor. So, it's the usual suspects. There is a handful that are capable of doing this, and we don't know who they are

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [30]

That's helpful, thanks. Can I just get some clarification, what does the first 100 million get you? And when you say launch late 2011, are we talking about one city being covered at first with that type of capital, more fulsome by the end of 2011?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [31]

Well, we are having a problem with disclosing that, because we know that competitors are on this call, and that's okay. We are okay with that. And -- but, certainly I am sure you'll be able to figure it out if you're thinking about it. But we have decided not to disclose which is first

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [32]

And maybe I can ask a different one. On that, when you think about this business and the analysis you've done so far, is your current thoughts that you would own 100% of your wireless business from start to finish, or is there any contemplation to joint ventures or partnerships with some of these US guys you talked about, or perhaps a cable company from another part of Canada?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [33]

That will (multiple speakers) 100%

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [34]

We are building to own. We tend to build to own everything that we offer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [35]

We are not a great partner. And (multiple speakers)

Unidentified Company Representative   [36]

And we've got -- you realize that the licenses that we had in Alberta and BC are provincial licenses which basically means that we can build out whatever corridors we want on our own spectrum. (multiple speakers) to interconnect cities, to do whatever we want from that perspective

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [37]

And then roam in rural areas or wherever you don't have coverage. Is that right, Michael?

Michael D'Avella,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Planning   [38]

Yes

Tim Casey, BMO Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [41]

Thanks. Sticking with wireless, in previous conference calls you've talked about a willingness to cooperate with Rogers if not partner with them. I'm wondering if is there anything you could comment on the nature of your discussions with Rogers in cooperating on a wireless buildout. And just to change tracks, you recently announced you've bought some more space on one of the satellites for Shaw Direct. Can you just review for us what the economics are of that transaction, and is there any implication to the balance sheet that we should be aware of? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [42]

I guess the first thing would be that with Rogers, we have (inaudible) discussions. They have done deals with others, not straight (technical difficulty) process, and it becomes part of the Canwest discussion, and it becomes part of a longer discussion. So we are kind of -- I think that our (inaudible) is of the mind that we just kind of hold and wait and they'll talk to us. And if they want us around, that's great. If you want us to build, we'll build. And we will be really, really quiet on the capital side to build (inaudible) because even with Canwest we got a lot of tower access. (technical difficulty) really helpful. So that's the first part of the question

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [43]

On the economics of the satellites, I don't know if you want to talk about it, but generally over the life of the satellite we will be paying for 16 transponders. It's that simple

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [44]

Maybe just add to that too, Tim, there is no cost to hit Shaw until late 2012

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [45]

And those costs flow right through the income statement, correct?

Unidentified Company Representative   [46]

No, the mechanical costs associated with -- in late 2012 (multiple speakers) lease costs, right? (multiple speakers) but it's a couple years out before we get into that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [47]

Is there a big bullet that comes in 2012, Steve?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [48]

No, it's a series of deposits that we make

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [49]

Can you quantify those?

Immaterial

 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [53]

Good morning guys. So I have to think that Peter has been banking that Wind Mobile comment for a while. (multiple speakers) waiting for an opportunity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [54]

(multiple speakers) we were thinking about it. When you think about when launching a product, you have to look frankly more prudently at how (inaudible) how big (inaudible) realized that coverage is absolutely critical, because what you're putting at risk is all of your bundling partners, which we have. And, so to the extent when we launch we are going to be launching 100% coverage in our markets, a very robust service, that adds value to the services our customers already have. And the point with, that Wind really has no customers, they launch frankly very quickly, and they lost a lot of credibility coming out of the gate because they had no coverage. Customers -- their expectations were not met. So it became almost like a passing of wind, is what my point was

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [55]

That's great, because that actually was my question for clarification -- whether your plan was 100% or 90% plus coverage or just (inaudible) coverage. (multiple speakers)

Unidentified Company Representative   [56]

It's going to be very comprehensive

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [57]

Thanks for that. Can I ask a question on cable economics? And I'm asking you in terms of a three- to five-year, kind of a medium-term outlook. It's pretty clear you still have some pricing power in the model. I think that's probably going to continue for some time. Subscriber growth is going to mature. And you've got this other issue out there called changing economics in this business that moves more toward on-demand, which some people could perceive as a threat. Could you give us a sense of what you think the business model, the growth is for operating cash flow in this business three to five years out? Is a 3% to 5% range, or is it a 5% to 7% range? And I'm talking excluding wireless

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [58]

Let's talk about some of the opportunities that we see. We have the pleasure of having cable [lads] visiting us this week for a bit of an orientation over some of the new technologies that they're working on that would be a part of our future growth opportunities. And we look at an opportunity to create more portals, to aggregate some of the over the top kinds of services that currently are (inaudible). most. We look at video on demand, some of the things that we are doing with enhanced high-definition. We are looking at, as you know, this weekend we are carrying the Masters in three-dimensional TV. So there's a whole host of really quite exciting things that we can do on the on-demand kind of platform, and of course that goes to our strategy, doesn't it, in terms of owning content. So we see that side as bolstering what already is a high value proposition from our customers with respect to the services they are getting. When we look at our ARPU, it's like a hockey stick with (inaudible) just going through puberty and it was 10 years ago, and ARPU today, it continues to go up. That's a great story

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [59]

But didn't we do AMC HD (multiple speakers)

Unidentified Company Representative   [60]

Yes, History HD was another one (multiple speakers)

Unidentified Company Representative   [64]

Somebody mentioned iconic products, and Brad is working (inaudible) our 10,600 staff, to make the iconic product. One of the keys is actually the service that we offer with our product

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [65]

The one thing that's depressing on here is that TELUS listing, and they get (inaudible) all our new moves. (multiple speakers)

Unidentified Company Representative   [66]

At the end of that day, technology will be there, so much our people, it's about execution, it's about delivering, and it's about every day and every moment. And we continue to focus on that and it continues to be a differentiator. And we'll continue to grow that, and sure -- we continue to make sure that we are executing where we want to go and what we want to do

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [67]

So, just to summarize, you don't think there is significant risk here. But are you guys thinking that there is a period of transition to occur at some point here. Are you worried slightly about this, or do you have no worry at all about (multiple speakers) on-demand?

Unidentified Company Representative   [68]

(multiple speakers) from the group that there would be a lot of worry. Listen, is there going to be a little competition? Yes is the answer. But we are coming up with more new products than anybody has seen, and if you go down and that 3-D product that Brad and Peter did and stuff -- it's just ripping hot

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [69]

The other thing you've got to appreciate is our structure and how flat we are. When you look around this table and beyond in management, we are so hands-on at all levels of the operations in the business. Day-to-day, we have a tremendous understanding of what's going on. And that has proved as a benefit and will be as we go forward

Thanks very much, guys

 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [72]

Thanks very much. Just continuing from some of the previous questions, when you're looking at all of these services and you're talking about all these iconic services that are coming, how important is the core bandwidth in the Company? And particularly I'm thinking we're just about a year -- just over a year away from the analog digital migration. And whether -- I'm just curious what you're thinking about as far as migrating the customer base and shutting down the analog network, and really I guess how important that is to a lot of the things that you're talking about, the new services

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [73]

Well, Jon, bandwidth is critical and we continue to build out fiber and fiber nodes, and on a smaller scale we are harvesting analog back. And, as our digital penetration continues to increase it's only a natural that we'll start harvesting those channels on a bigger market basis over the next while. Because the demand is incredible on the network and on the content. People demand it everywhere and at any time is -- continues to drive capacity issues. So we are focused on that, and we are very much in need of speed. So we are constantly doing that (multiple speakers)

Unidentified Company Representative   [74]

If you look at the growth in our digital products over the last few years, that's been driven by our recognition that one day we are going to be able to convert all of our customers to a digital platform and free up a significant analog platform. And when that analog capacity that we are going to free up is going to be used for higher rates of Internet services, it will be used for IP technologies, (inaudible) today that will be required to compete for digital products, for more Internet products. It will be more products like 3-D, will take up a little bit more capacity, but when we rescue all of that analog capacity by doing that digital, it's going to be a tremendous advantage to us. We are looking also at fiber to the home, Brad, 100-gig services --

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - EVP   [75]

(multiple speakers) yes, and a variety of wiring solutions and trials, and we're just looking at a variety of those things

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [76]

And, maybe down the road we look at -- maybe there is no over the air. So we -- say CanWest global, whatever, (inaudible) our service, so you could only get it when you get attached to the line. Right? So there's been a lot of conversation around that, which is a real new, interesting idea

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [77]

Well, it's keeping the relationship with the customer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [78]

I said -- so, we get to keep the relationship with the customer, then we will be okay

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [79]

(multiple speakers) have it now? (multiple speakers)

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [80]

And, so why shouldn't we take advantage of that, and do we really care whether we have our [TV] transmitter, other than it might be doing wireless? Maybe we do, maybe we don't. I don't know

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [81]

So when you think about all of the services and reclaiming or switching off the analog eventually, when you think about the CapEx profile going out a few years from now, would you expect that excluding wireless, just the core cable CapEx profile, would you expect that to be able to stay flat even with the migration, or do you think that this could actually come down a little bit?

Unidentified Company Representative   [82]

I know it will be flat, so, what 900 million?

Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [83]

800

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [84]

800?

Unidentified Company Representative   [85]

Yes, I think reasonably flat. Depending on the success of penetration and how (multiple speakers) pretty well, as we go about executing and harvesting those channels back, we will -- might cause a little bit of flux in that, but I think you can (multiple speakers)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [86]

Our average customer per node has gone down steadily, and it will get to the point where no segmentation will become less of a critical issue than it is right now. Right now it is critical

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [87]

Yes, and still, it's going to be a combination, Peter, of (multiple speakers)

Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [88]

If I could ask two very, very quickly clarifications. First, Jim, you said launch late 2011. Are you talking calendar or fiscal 2011?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [89]

You know, I can't tell you everything because the boys don't tell me everything either. So there is a problem here on communication. But I would probably say late -- later

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [90]

The other quick clarification for Peter. You said -- you mentioned CAD500 million for the network available would be at the very high end of that. I am assuming that doesn't include any sort of spectrum cost if you were to go to the auction next summer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [91]

Right, that's correct. I mean listen, I don't know how -- we don't know how the other guys are going to do -- what do you call them Peter? Wind [of fire] or something?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [92]

Opportunity wind

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [93]

And [global debt], what -- did I say that? That kind of thing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [94]

Appreciate it, thanks very much again

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [95]

Glen Campbell, Merrill/Banc of America

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [96]

Thanks very much. Just, again, to clarify, the CAD100 million you're investing next year would be all CapEx, so you're talking about CAD100 million a year after that. Would those future investments be just CapEx, or are you including a mix of CapEx and additional operating losses in there?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - SVP and CFO   [97]

The CAD100 million we are referring to is basically CapEx, so it's a minimal OpEx amount. So -- and, what we plan to do going forward for next year is we will separate our wireless into a separate segment so that investors have visibility to the ongoing operations of cable and satellite, and they won't be mixed and you will be able to see the investment in satellite and the OpEx with satellite and track that separately. I am not sure -- you said CAD100 million for next year, I don't (multiple speakers)

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [98]

(multiple speakers) CAD100 million next year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [99]

And roaming, your in-region rights expire at the end of the initial five-year period once you've got a national kind of arrangement going. How are you thinking about that this year?

Unidentified Company Representative   [100]

Our expectation is that we are going to have pretty comprehensive coverage over the next five years within our main territory

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [101]

And, the US

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [102]

And we'll have roaming agreements obviously outside of the territory as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [103]

When you say comprehensive coverage, do you mean urban and rural? Because, presumably, your customers care a lot about rural coverage as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [104]

Yes, but bear in mind that most of the coverage is along major corridors, and it's not very difficult to figure out what those corridors are in our territory

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [105]

And we had fiber in those (inaudible) corridors as well, so that is going to help us (multiple speakers)

Unidentified Company Representative   [106]

Yes, that is (inaudible) in negotiation, right?

Unidentified Company Representative   [107]

Yes, backhaul [providers], and they give us the tower and that kind of stuff, right?

Unidentified Company Representative   [108]

Yes, and the roaming will continue beyond the five years

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [109]

Fair enough. Just on the TV side, there were a couple of brief references during the call to maybe an IP-based TV product, something that would respond to the TELUS IP TV product. Is there anything you could tell us about that, and what you have in mind there?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [110]

I think we're too early in the stage for that, but I know the boys are working on it, and it's on our mind. We've got Internet ideas, we've got a whole bunch of ideas and the team here is doing a great job of incorporating CanWest. So I would just say, we can't really comment yet because negotiations are continuing and we've just got to hold back

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [111]

And one last one on the network upgrades. There's a pretty chunky part of your CapEx in cable that's going to upgrades, and Peter, you talk about reducing (inaudible). Once you've hit that analog cutoff date, presumably you don't have to split nodes beyond that. How much of a savings would that bring? And if you're thinking about CapEx remaining roughly flat going forward, kind of what comes in to replace that? Why shouldn't we see a step down in CapEx?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [112]

We've been asking that question for 20 years, Glen, and it seems to have -- there seems to be always something that's (multiple speakers) we have to do in order to satiate our customers' demands for more services. And we have 55 HD products now. We have video on demand, we have contention that we have to deal with on our video product where now most of our customers are using our VoD as opposed to pay-per-view ordering processes. That takes some CapEx. So, three years ago we had to really -- it wasn't as significant a part of what we are doing, so contention is going to be what's going to drive our need for capital expenditures. And we do -- we will manage it and we can manage it as we did with digital boxes. There's going to be a time when the requirement for digital box CapEx is going to diminish, because most customers will have it in their homes. But there will always be some churn associated with that as well. So that's why we say flat -- it's probably a safe bet to say that our CapEx will be flat and in the range it is now

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [113]

And, why can't you move your rating on us?

Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [114]

Well, I was hoping to hear the answer in that last question. It's hard to think of anything that would add more value to the stock than bringing down the (multiple speakers)

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [115]

-- constantly wrong and you're -- oh, I forgot you work for Merrill. I'm just joking. Just teasing you a little bit there, dude

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS Securities - Analyst   [118]

Thanks very much for taking my question. Actually, I just want a quick clarification. You indicated in the past that you take a measured and cautious approach on wireless and the CAD100 million that you guys announced today definitely seems consistent with that approach. Can we sort of expect this consistency looking beyond 2010, CAD100 million per year, or do you see some ramp-up in wireless spending as necessary to get sort of the footprint coverage that you want at launch?

Unidentified Company Representative   [119]

CAD100 million is a good start in terms of getting back office systems in place, getting some of the infrastructure in place. We see it's going up for a next couple of years after that to meet the deployment phasing that we've got in our plan. But it's going to be measured and we are going to manage that capital expenditure around all the other things that we are doing. (multiple speakers)

Unidentified Company Representative   [120]

Not a lot (multiple speakers)

Unidentified Company Representative   [121]

We are not going to sacrifice things that have been near and dear to us over the last 20, 25 years because we are launching wireless. It's going to be launched in a way that's consistent with the way we've done things in the past. Remember when we launched telephone. This week, we have -- [100] -- [a] million customers, Brad?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - EVP   [122]

Yes, yesterday

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [123]

And we've done it within the skin that we've had. There was a lot of worries when we were launching telephone about us blowing their brains out. We can only (technical difficulty) so much and so fast and do it wisely, and that's the course we are taking

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS Securities - Analyst   [124]

Great. So is it fair to assume -- obviously there's some speculation out there that you'll have to potentially (inaudible) the dividend growth or -- along those lines in order to kind of pursue wireless. Now is it fair to assume that's just noise, or -- ?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [125]

I would think, and the Chairman can talk here too, but I would think that it's fair to assume that we [have] always been on the path of returning growth and dividends to shareholders, and that won't change. And that when you talk to the board, they want to return dividends to shareholders. Now whether you can do it right at the right time or right at some month or a quarter later, that's a different issue. But still, we are pretty proactive about running the business and everybody here is really proactive. So I think that I feel pretty good comfort in that. That's our philosophy and that's the approach we have taken

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS Securities - Analyst   [126]

Got it, thanks very much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [127]

Peter MacDonald, GMP Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [128]

Just first, if I could return back to the dividend again. I've got a clarification on that. You're focused on maintaining the dividend. Is it maintaining the dividend growth model that you have in place, or are you more focused just on maintaining what you have as far as the dividend right now?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [129]

I think that would not be my decision, it would be a board decision. And everybody would be involved. But it's not that we are opposed to dividends. So we are kind of more proactive dividends than we are proactive share buyback

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [130]

And --

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [131]

Just because I go with what the Chairman always said, if we increase the dividend, we touch everybody. If we buy share back, we only touch a couple

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [132]

That has been a consistent statement from the Company. So can we get from that the investments that you're making in wireless and the potential investment in Canwest, that you're confident both in your balance sheet and the flexibility of your balance sheet and in your (inaudible) CapEx that you [said] that philosophy can be maintained, considering where you might be?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [133]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [134]

And then, just as a separate question on fee for carriage, I was interested in what your thoughts were with respect to the initial decision, and given your new unique position, whether or not you thought any of the large broadcasters would opt into negotiated settlement

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [135]

I'm going to let Jean talk about that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jean Brazeau,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Regulatory   [136]

First, there is certainly a court decision that needs to be rendered, because the issue was sent to the federal court to review whether the CRTC had the authority to imposed a negotiation regime. So we will see what we will see. I think the court is scheduled to look at this late September or early October. We think we made a very good case that this is really a copyright issue, and that the CRTC does not have the authority. That should be regimed come into play. The CRTC recognized a lot of our arguments in their decision. The negotiations will be market-based. We will be able to argue that the value and distribution that we bring to the negotiation, so I think we will be in fairly good shape to negotiate reasonable transmission rates for these signals

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [137]

Jean, do you think that we would be able to pass those costs along?

Jean Brazeau,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Regulatory   [138]

The commission says absolutely, that we could pass those costs along. So if there are additional fees resulting from this new tax, then yes, it obviously would be just the normal cost and like any other costs, those are passed on

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [139]

So, just back to the original question, do you think anybody would opt into that negotiation losing some of the benefits they have under regulatory protection right now?

Jean Brazeau,  Shaw Communications - SVP, Regulatory   [140]

Those are significant benefits, and they would have to certainly think very seriously before they sat down and started negotiating a new form of compensation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [141]

Anyway we look at it, I assume you believe that the impact, the financial impact on cost, whether it's passed through or not, would be substantially less than what was originally feared when fee for carriage first was discussed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [142]

It would be (inaudible) wouldn't it? Well, we bring significant value (multiple speakers)

Unidentified Company Representative   [143]

(multiple speakers) might even be a gain on the other side if you think about how we would negotiate that and change it around. Maybe we could turn it around a little bit, so it might be actually a plus, not a minus

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [144]

And, don't forget that in a year or so, this is going to be a whole new regime of digital packaging. And we have some say in how we package our services, and that adds a value to our print and broadcasting. So most of the value will be seen in kind

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [147]

Good morning. Going back to wireless, a few follow-up questions. One, on the CapEx for 2010, has there been any spending in the first half of this year yet? (multiple speakers)

Unidentified Company Representative   [148]

I would say moderate. Like CAD10 million maybe? What do you think? (multiple speakers)

Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [149]

So I guess in terms of the second half of this year, about CAD15 million per quarter. As we look out to 2011 is that CAD50 million run rate something that's reasonable for us to look at for 2011?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [150]

No, we said CAD100 million

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [151]

Only CAD100 million for 2011?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [152]

No, 2010 is CAD100 million. 2011 we'll let you know when we get closer to it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [153]

Okay, all right. And on -- in terms of penetration of the service, did I hear you guys right that you said a little but over 1 million customers, is that what you're kind of looking at?

Unidentified Company Representative   [154]

No (multiple speakers) no. We haven't made any -- I think (multiple speakers)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [155]

We were talking about was spectrum that we have would provide a very robust service to about 1 million customers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [156]

Oh, I see

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [157]

Yes, so that's [the asset] we have, right? We could do 1 million customers with that asset (multiple speakers)

Unidentified Company Representative   [158]

Yes, or possibly more, depending on what technology we ultimately deploy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [159]

So, maybe as a follow-on to that, if we look at wireless as a service versus all the other services you guys have launched and been very successful at over the years, how should we look at the penetration and pickup of wireless as you go to market with this product?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [160]

Good, steady growth. (multiple speakers) I think when I talk to everybody, we are talking about simple, not too complicated. We are talking about trying to entice not maybe the main holder, like not the main dudes who uses his cell a lot, are starting to work through the family, and how we do that with our three -- how many customers do we have now, 3.4 million? (multiple speakers) Yes, so how do we intend -- enhance that and take it forward? Brad can help with this

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - EVP   [161]

You've got to look at, we're still developing the package in that, but it's certainly going to be more, I would think, bandwidth-focused from a data point of view than a voice and then doing that. When you look at execution you've just got to look at our track record and how well we've been able to manage it and I think we've done a pretty good job. And I don't see anything different going forward as we manage all these buckets and do an excellent job of wireless

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [162]

Don't we, Brad, have all the backhaul and all that stuff to keep the cost down like we did with Internet? Like our Internet cost is so low, right?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - EVP   [163]

Well, you look at the data usage, yes. Owning all of those facilities is huge and, as we lay fiber to these towers it's going to be very important and all that backhaul becomes pretty critical on the network. So all that is going to be to our advantage as we roll forward, just as it has been before

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [164]

One last question. Wireless is a bit of a different technology when it comes to airways and interference, and managing a network can be very different from a cable or a wireline network. Can you talk about the teams that you have gathered or the team that you're going to be assembling? Is it going to be a separate group that's going to be managing the wireless business going forward?

Unidentified Company Representative   [165]

We have learned that integrating products and maximizing economies of scale with your existing infrastructure results in 76% of our customers taking Internet, 44% of our customers taking telephony because we all take responsibility for those products. Instead of having a separate group -- think when we first launched our at-home product. There were some companies in the US that treated it separately, and nobody was embracing it in the local region. We find our customers -- our service and sales support people embrace products as products, not separate infrastructure. So we are going to maximize our leverage with all of our infrastructure, technical staff there's -- this is a big industry and we can attract some very, very world-class wireless people. We already have done that, and that's part of the process. We weren't telephone guys five years ago. Now we have 1 million customers. So the same thing will happen. We'll get the right people managing the business, and then we'll work within our current infrastructure

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [166]

Yes, and I think we are seeing, there's a variety of Canadians that work overseas in Europe, in Asia, and they're looking to come back. So that access to the talent is there and we're feeling comfortable about it

 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [169]

Thank you guys for taking my question. Many of my questions have been asked already, but I just want to ask you maybe a big picture question on your wireless venture. When you look at TELUS, they're increasing quickly their IPTV offering in your territory, they're spending a lot of money. More -- if I look longer-term, in about three years they will have a lot of coverage of IPTV in their territory. Do you think in let's say two to three years you'll have more than 50% of your customers having the opportunity to take a Shaw wireless solution into their home?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [170]

I would probably say yes. Yes would be the answer. (multiple speakers)

Unidentified Company Representative   [171]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [172]

Yes, and I mean I know they're doing a big push, and -- but we are not the least competitive guys in the world

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [173]

I would say that would be two to three

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [174]

Two to three years; so, by the end of 2013 -- (multiple speakers)

Unidentified Company Representative   [175]

Somewhere in there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [176]

Just to address some of your concerns about growing competition on the television side, certainly the IPTV reach today, and we are four or five years into this competition with this product, is way deeper than what you just described in terms of percentages. And we certainly are taking lots of growth within our customer base competing with the IPTV product on really broad distribution today and intense marketing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [177]

Great, and maybe just a question on the cable side, two small questions there. When I look at your stand-alone Internet customers, they seem to start to decline a bit. Can you maybe tell us what you're seeing there? Are these most customers taking bundles now than before? And my second question is more on the cost initiative than containment. Looking into your cable business, do you see any potential opportunities to maybe get some cost out and push those margins up a bit in the next two years?

Unidentified Company Representative   [178]

Two good questions, one in terms of the standalone Internet basis. There's been a very conscious shift in our business throughout this fiscal year to focus on triple play customers. And so as a result we are not chasing (inaudible) customers in the way that may have been chased in the past. For sure you are seeing, that [will] (inaudible) our numbers and we know that that strategy works. It's all about long-term profitable growth and long-term relationships with our customers. So you're certainly seeing that in the numbers

In terms of cost containment, we are pretty happy with cable margin improvements in the previous quarter and we are pretty excited about the cost containment opportunities in our business. A big chunk of it comes from the triple play growth and the cost containment from taking some churn out of the business. You've also seen several quarters in a row in terms of strong growth in our high-margin products of Internet and phone and that helps a lot, and certainly we are executing in a financially disciplined way throughout the business. So I think you're going to continue to see that kind of disciplined execution

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [179]

Do you think maybe your margins could be continuing to increase maybe 100 or 200 basis points going forward for the year?

Unidentified Company Representative   [180]

When you look at all of what we've built over the last couple of years in terms of the phone product and 1 million customers and all of the costs that are associated in doing that, both from a CapEx and OpEx point of view, maintaining and improving our customer focus, and on the digital TV side, let's not underestimate that 65% of penetration in digital customers, how important that is for both a defensive point of view. Our ARPU is just under CAD20, [our] total with all those new customers. And also from a defensive point of view. So this year you've seen in the quarter our margin of 48.5%. Last year for the full year it was 48.3% and the year before it was 48.5%. We expect it will be in that range again. And all of that takes into account the fact that we are going to be growing OpEx cost in the second half of the year to begin to build wireless and all of that

So, when you look at the absolute growth in EBITDA and the fact that we've maintained very constant margins, I think we've done a good job of managing cost as well in all of that and balancing the cost and investment equations

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [181]

And, how many customers have we added?

Unidentified Company Representative   [182]

About 1 million -- something, something

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [183]

Well, we have [1.8] million of Internet, we've got 1 million in telephone (multiple speakers)

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [184]

Digital, 1 million in HD -- a lot, you know, new 3-D, we've got -- there's so much going on

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [185]

We have a back office system that continues to be evolving --

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [186]

Second to none, yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [187]

And cost of growth, you just look at phone alone, and I think we've had 10 quarters in a row of over 50,000 growth. So it's certainly continuing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [188]

Yes, it's awesome and the margin on those is great because we just use local infrastructure, right?

Unidentified Company Representative   [189]

That's right

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [190]

So perfect

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator instructions). Glen Campbell

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Hartz,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [2]

This is [Steve Hartz] on behalf of Glen Campbell, who is traveling. First, I will say congrats for the good quarter. Just a couple of quick questions. We were wondering if you could provide us with a quick updated view on the expected wireless CapEx, now that the MSN deal is signed? How much do you expect to spend in order to launch the major markets? And if you can talk about recent changes to your cable and [triple K] promotions?

Unidentified Company Representative   [3]

Steve, I can talk to -- according to CapEx for wireless, we've committed to CAD100 million spend, and were still on track, even though we are a little lighter this quarter, but certainly buying for network and some other things in place, that's the number we are driving to

And then on promotions, we knew that would come up somehow this call. There ahs been a lot of activity and a lot of noise from some of the other providers on our most aggressive price points in the world. All I can say to that is that offer we do is we offer, that CAD9.95 offer to double play customers. We are currently getting over CAD100 ARPU from them. And so we really feel it's a nice way to introduce the triple play in a nice introductory six-month offer. And as always with promotions, they come up and they go down and we move things around in what is successful. And so you will continue to see that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tim Casey

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [5]

Could you clarify a bit more on the regulatory process on Canwest? You mentioned you expect it to close in the fall. That would imply a pretty short review at the CRTC. I'm just wondering if you could clarify a little bit more on the process that has to go through there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [6]

Well, actually, it's consistent with the timing that we have normally with the Commission on these type of applications. We had filed our applications in May. We expect now, as the court is dealing with the situation, that it will be decided in the near future, and then there will be a comment period before a hearing some time in the month of September. So we are on track in terms of normal time on this. There's no change in terms of normal process for this kind of application

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [7]

And in terms of remaining issues regarding the creditor process, when do you expect those to be resolved?

Unidentified Company Representative   [8]

(multiple speakers). The court has approved for the plan and also the policy circular to creditors. There will be a meeting of creditors on July 19, and the following week, assuming that is approved, which the Monitor would not have put it forward were he not positive that it would be approved, the court will issue the order. And then the only thing remaining will be the Regulatory Competition Bureau and CRTC approval

Vince Valentini

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest/Waterhouse Securities - Analyst   [10]

Two questions, one maybe just more of an accounting one for Steve. You had some wireless EBITDA this quarter. Just a small negative amount, but I would've thought pre-launch cost would have just been capitalized. So in order to try to model this going forward for the next five, six quarters, let's say, before you launch, can you give us some sense of what is in there and how that will grow?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [11]

I won't be specific at this point, but it's not everything is going to be capitalized in terms of pre-launch cost. It's only items that we would normally capitalize in a sales environment. But there will be OpEx that will be expensed

I think what is important for everybody to understand is that you see the segmented disclosure that we are going to give you, and so you will have full visibility to the OpEx as it flows forward, and full visibility to the capital that we're spending in wireless

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest/Waterhouse Securities - Analyst   [12]

The other question is on the business market, maybe Brad or whoever wants to take it. Can you give us some sense of how much traction you are getting with the small and medium business segment, specifically in the Internet side and on telephony? A lot of people look at your Internet penetration and combine it with the telcos in your market and say, geez, that Western Canada market is almost saturated in terms of broadband penetration. But I suspect we're seeing an increasing amount of business penetration in your Internet subs that would, I guess, change the change the denominators. So can you give us some flavor as to how much traction you are getting there, and maybe what percentage of your Internet and telephony subs are now businesses versus residences?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - EVP Operations   [13]

On the phone side we continue to have good traction, similar to previous quarters. Just under 11,000 small business adds on the phone side are included in the numbers. On the Internet side we continue to think there's great opportunity, but the success you are seeing is largely on the residential side. Our business Internet adds would be in the low, small single-digit thousands for the quarter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [14]

I think, too, Vince, when you look at it, that we've been going quarter after quarter where everybody said that our Internet penetration couldn't come up. As the team here launches new, like DOCSIS 3 and 100 Mb programs -- and also it's just we are seeing like gains every quarter when everybody says, oh, no, you can't gain any more and you're totally saturated

So I think that will be the same on the business market as we are seeing on the consumer market, and basically, generally I think what the team sees around here

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - EVP Operations   [15]

You're right, Jim. Vince, this is Brad. Just to add to that, we are probably seeing a little bit of churn in the business as how it has moved away from contracts, and that's creating a little more churn in the business, so that might also be contributing

 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [17]

Now that you have announced a network equipment vendor, anything more that you can share on the rollout strategy? And I'm specifically thinking of the possibility of -- you've got this late 2011 estimated launch time. Is it possible, since it seems like you are going with an HSP A+ strategy migration to LTE, is it possible that you could be launching in specific markets sooner than later 2011?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [18]

I don't know if we can really divulge that right now, but it's a good question

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [19]

Phillip Huang

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [20]

I just want to get a sense of -- to what extent are you seeing economic recovery and housing growth in your footprint, healthier business in terms of subscribers, and also (inaudible) risk to rate increases?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - EVP Operations   [21]

I think you are seeing very strong economics happening in the marketplace, which is enabling us to continue to post strong subscriber growth, and also opportunity for the other guys to grow as well. That's the great thing about the Western (inaudible) economy is that there's room for both of us to grow

In terms of rate increases, our pricing strategy has been consistent. And we continue to move down the same pricing strategy that we've had for the last number of years. And I think the economy allows for that as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [22]

I was want to -- I was going to say just as a follow on, on your success on home phone service, obviously, a great quarter with a record number of net additions. And this is in contrast with your peers, who have been reporting consistently slower net additions over the past several quarters. I'm just trying to understand a bit more behind -- the reasons behind that. To what extent are you seeing the benefits of the improving economy and earning growth? And also is a just a function of greater marketing promotions? And what do you think about the risk of a more aggressive response from TELUS?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [23]

I guess you would start off by saying right off the hop that, one, we don't know what the other guys are doing all the time. We talk to them a bit, but we just do our own thing, and we just rely on our own team here, and they do a good job at delivering service

I think a lot of it just comes by word of mouth, where you say, do you like how your phone service works? Do you like this? Do you like that? And we just attract them. We've been able to do that with a lot of our products over a lot of years. So I don't think you're seeing anything different than we're used to seeing here

And of course, do we have promotions? Of course we do. But you know what? We see -- what we see out there, people are attracted to our products

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - EVP Operations   [24]

And I think it fits in somewhat with our objective to create an excellent customer experience, whatever interaction you have with whatever Shaw company, each and every time. So I think that continues to differentiate. And, as you said, promotions will be up and down and move around. And I think we maybe found one that's working well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [25]

There was a preception to our promotion, and that's -- the preception was that somehow we were giving it away for CAD30; and that isn't the case. It's a triple play going from a double play. As Brad said early that for CAD10 more on a double-play our ARPU is still over CAD100

Jeff Fan

 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [28]

I wanted to ask you guys a question about the future of the cable service and how it stacks up to IPTV, because I guess there has been a lot of concerns about IPTV and how it impacts the cable service and whether cable is now behind the eight ball when it comes to technology. It certainly doesn't look that way, based on the results that we are seeing

And if you look at the US cost and content that these guys are deploying new features like multiroom, interactive guides -- so I wanted to see what you guys are doing on that front, and any insight you could give us on the roadmap for new cable features that's coming down the pipeline over the next number of months and quarters?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - EVP Operations   [29]

It's interesting you're asking the question today, because yesterday we actually spent some time with our engineering group just talking about that very topic. And it was actually very, very exciting when we looked at some of the enablers that we have in terms of new products, where we look at our folks on a capacity expansion, MPEG 4 devices that we'll be making available that can provide even more high definition services

There's a lot of development to our cable adds with respect to two-way Android devices, IP technologies. And we should clarify this because there's misconceptions that IP somehow is not completely real. IP is just a platform (inaudible) platform (inaudible) under development. It doesn't have anything to do with the experience -- the customers' experience

If you put our high definition and all the definition services that we offer up against any other competitor, you will find that they are exemplary and they are high-quality

And then the other thing we're looking at is how we aggregate content in the cloud, and content libraries, delivery systems -- of course, that has been our [discussing] our modus operandi. We deliver content; and to the extent that we keep focusing on building our network and making the node smaller, that's going to be an enabler

There's also many devices out there right now. There's thin clients, there's IP devices, there's gateway devices. And these are all being developed for a cable application, as opposed to VDSL or ADSL applications

And then within the home we are seeing a great deal of success from our focus on the WiFi networks, and the kind of programs that are available in the -- whether it's mobility through our fiber to the home. We lost recently, our (inaudible) VOD website. And our customers are now able to -- essentially those customers that have movie services -- they are able to get more content, like Entourage programs, etc., through a price. And they can actually display it on their PC. They can display it on a mobile device, ultimately. They can display on their TV. They can pause it, they can move it, they can stop watching it on one device and go to another device

So there's tremendous things that we are doing. We're looking at high definition, higher definition. We're looking at Blu-ray quality 1080 ATP. We're looking at -- you know, 3-D impacts the last two games of the World Cup will be in 3-D. We're looking at this advanced network -- advertising network with our advertisers. And particularly when we look at the (inaudible) with our broadcasting content, they are looking to (inaudible) the list of what we can do in terms of relevant, directable advertising

So I could go on and on. I think we did, for a couple of hours. We are extremely excited. We don't think that there's an appreciation of what we actually do have. And plus, Jeff, because you've seen it first hand, and I think there should be maybe less emphasis on what IP is and more emphasis on what are our customers asking us to provide to them and what are they searching for. And we think we are, in a very short period of time, going to be able to deliver a multiple array, on multiple platforms, on multiple devices of great programming. We call it Shaw any time, any device, anywhere

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [30]

On the enhancement to the user experience, are you comfortable that you can get that into your customers without any change to your CapEx intensity profile in the core cable business?
  Secondly, on the timing of when some of these things may come. And then, lastly, obviously you guys track churn to TELUS or MTS IPTV. I'm wondering whether if you guys have any conclusions as to why some of those customers are moving over?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [31]

One of the things I'll (inaudible) just regroup here, Brad or Jay or whoever is going to talk. But it reminds me a little bit where everybody goes, well, IPTV is going to take over. Well, it reminds me of when they used to call the satellites the death star, and they were going to kill all cable, and all cable was going to be gone

So one thing is -- the one think that when you look at the network, it's so solid and in really good shape. Now does it need some CapEx once in a while and that kind of thing? Yes, it does. But it's a solid network with lots of fiber and lots of capacity to build things. So there's no exclusivity to anything or any product that anyone (inaudible) and maybe our product is different, but we will have a product that competes in that arena

And so just how we come up with that product and how we develop our product. And we rank one an exclusive product, or we might license the product. We've got a few options there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [32]

Typically, what we do is when we add a new product or a new device, it's not a matter of deploying it across all 3 million of our customers. It's a matter of providing a product that actually would maybe have a unique device, maybe an IP gateway device, and those customers that want to enjoy that type of in-home gateway, they will call us and say, I'd love to have that product. And so you provide that device with them as they want the product

And it has worked well for us on HD boxes. It will work well for us on MPEG 4, and it will work well for us on the kind of wireless in-home devices that we are actually advertising right now, and we are getting a great take-up on

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - EVP Operations   [33]

Just to amplify what Peter is saying, in terms of the CapEx model, everything Peter is talking about is funded within our long-term CapEx approach, so we are not forecasting an increasing intensity to do what Peter is talking about

A major step forward -- a number of major steps forward will happen certainly in months and not years in terms of timing. And then back to the TELUS TV piece. Certainly historically, as we've gone over the last five years of relatively intense competition, people have left us for price. We're quite excited about the new environment and the opportunity with optic TV to be able to compete based on customer experience. And we are really excited about the next stage in that competition

Dvai Ghose

 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [35]

Again, your cable numbers are great, despite TELUS TV. The one thing that TELUS keeps pushing in their advertising is anywhere PVR, so one PVR across to six TVs. And I think the thing they're going to push in the fall is wireless TV, programming your set-top box from wireless. So when can you introduce -- obviously, wireless, you have to launch the product. But on the one set-top box for six TVs, when can you introduce that? And is that really a big deal? And indeed, is the wireless aspect a big deal, in your opinion?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - EVP Operations   [36]

No and no. On the wireless device (inaudible)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [37]

And the wireless device, as you know, is not tied to any particular network. You can do it with anybody's wireless, or wireless device. It's just a question of do we have the application to allow people to program a PVR, and we do. (inaudible)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [38]

On the pricing side, you have the Q1 TELUS call, I'm sure, as we all did. And Darren from TELUS talked about the time to turn the other cheek is now over, and basically saying that he is going to respond to some of your promotions with some aggressive TV promotions. Is that a concern, or do you think you just have the quality that it doesn't matter?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [39]

Well, hasn't he already done that already? This is not something new. What was (inaudible) Jay or Brad or --

Unidentified Company Representative   [40]

Well there is a free -- there is a CAD650 laptop they were giving away for free. A year of triple play for CAD30, Brad?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - EVP Operations   [41]

Yes, CAD30

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [42]

So that's pretty aggressive. And I think we've also heard that call. It was probably the most assertive that he's been in a long time. And we didn't know whether or not that was just to maybe mask some of the results that they had seen, because there seems to be misunderstanding in he said, and what the offers were that were available in the marketplace

And again, as Brad said, those are cyclical and they may not come back in the the marketplace for a while. That's the nature of our work

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [43]

That makes sense. That is what competition is all about. And then the last question I had which is slightly different on the competitive side, so Rogers acknowledged today that they're going to launch this chatter unlimited wireless plan sometime by the end of the summer. So what it leads me to ask you is, number one, are you concerned, especially if they launch it outside their cable territories, which may make sense not to cannibalize their home phone -- are you concerned that it will take customers from your home phone in some magnitude?
  And, number two, what is your own view of unlimited wireless supply plans, in light of your wireless launch planned for the end of next year?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [44]

Well, you would have to say that it's a little too early for us to respond to that because, of course, we only heard that information today, too. So I think that the one thing that we build on, a wireless platform on and all of our stuff on, all of our products, whether it's the Canwest acquisition and everything, is the fact that we have already 3.4 million customers, and we are just going to try to reach those

And we are not a for-pay. We are way more than that if you include satellite, over-the-air TVs, specialty channels. So we have a lot of tools in the tool belt

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [45]

And clearly it's a preemptive approach, and they are still preserving their title services, such as preemptive. But I would think that, rather than worry about the rest of Canada, I'd be worrying about Quebec, because I hear Videotron is going to do a pretty good job of providing services in Quebec, and [Sal] and TELUS and Rodgers have to be on their best to work within that competitive an environment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Genuity Capital Markets - Analyst   [46]

Thank you very much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Company Representative   [47]

Let me just come back to one thing for the benefit of our shareholders on the line. As we said, the comments we made on promotions, and this may have been because of us [standing] on the promotions, but for the benefit of our shareholders who are listening, just to give you the facts, our ARPU in the fourth quarter -- our total cable ARPU -- you can all figure out this number -- in the fourth quarter of last year was CAD97. And in the third quarter of this year it's CAD104. So it has gone up CAD7

I can tell you, in the first three quarters of this year we are running at record Internet ARPUs. You are seeing our digital ARPU has only come down slightly and it's still at CAD20, even with the addition of -- even with going from 40% penetration to 70% penetration. So all I can say is those are the facts. You can't hide promotions in the ARPU figure; they are what they are. And so that's where we are at

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [50]

Maybe I can ask you on the wireless CapEx for 2011, when do you expect to release your guidance for 2011?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [51]

We usually do it in the fall, right?

Unidentified Company Representative   [52]

Yes, so we'll be releasing all of the guidance at the end of October when we do our year-end call

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [53]

You might have mentioned this on the last call, but from my understanding it should not be very high incremental increase in CapEx spending in 2011 versus 2010. Is it multiples of 2010, or just a small increase you expect to see?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - EVP Operations   [54]

It will be more intense than the mid 2010 number, obviously. But at this point I think that's as far as we would like to go

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [55]

Just maybe going back to the dividend question, now you have under your belt a lot of information regarding the Canwest acquisition cost. You probably have advanced your understanding of your spending on wireless. Can you maybe review for us your take on what dividend increase you think is sufficient for you guys to continue the dividend growth model? And how could you finance a potential increase in dividend, if you are contemplating such a thing?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [56]

Steve will probably have a comment. But I think we are probably on the stage where we need to get the Canwest transaction done. We need to consolidate our wireless plans, which are happening right now. We need to come out with our year-end on that. So I think that -- I don't know if it will go up or down; that would be up to the Board to approve that, but right now it's looking fairly conservative

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [57]

On the promotional side we've been seeing TELUS offering a [3 combo] for CAD30 a month promotion out West. Like the same question many analysts asked TELUS on the call last quarter, and they responded by saying that they are going to reevaluate your promotional offering, I'm going to ask you the same thing. How can you afford not to retaliate to a CAD30 a month promotion by TELUS to drive customers? Do you think product differentiation alone from you guys can sustain that potential threat, or you will have to result to reducing your pricing to face that?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - EVP Operations   [58]

I think it's a little bit challenging to play a game of gotcha on some individual tactical executions. Those targeted offers that happen from time to time as people come in and out of the markets and whatnot, we are absolutely committed to lessening the promotional intensity in the marketplace. And I think we are actually seeing some of that happen in the marketplace with the outperformance coming up in spaces

So I think there is some danger in trying to chase an offer and try and find an offer that's being used in new build or try and find an offer. I think you will see it in the macro numbers. And as Steve indicated, our macro numbers are good. We will compete as much as we want to compete, but we would absolutely love to compete on customer experience

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [59]

Peter MacDonald

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [60]

Maybe I could just ask a question on the dividend. It sounds as though you -- in the past that the dividend growth model was something that you wanted to just absolutely keep in place. And at this time here I just wanted to make sure I understood exactly what you are saying. You are being conservative right now in your interpretation. You are not going to make a decision until you at least get through the year end. But did you say that it could possibly go up or could possibly go down, or is your intention still to keep it as a dividend growth model?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [61]

I guess I need to take my direction from the Board to give the team here their direction. Certainly, I don't think we're looking at a down model. I think we're looking at either a growth model or maybe a hold model. I don't know, we're going to have to look as we work through all these acquisitions and get everything lined up. And so I would say that at the end of the day you are probably -- listen, we are a dividend growth Company. So we decided that a few years ago, fight it out with my father, my brother and all the management team here, and we've been pretty resilient on that. And I think that's what you should expect

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [62]

If I can ask a question separate from that, just a modeling question. In the release that -- and this is on the satellite side -- you talk about some of these revenue declines and the EBITDA declines on the satellite services business as being part of some renegotiations on pricing. If we take this quarter, is this the normalized quarter, or is there some one-time items that we have to be concerned about?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [63]

There were some one-time contract spot rate renegotiations with some of our venders. And that's completed now, so as we move forward it will continue to be positive

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [64]

So it will go back to something like last quarter or --?

Unidentified Company Representative   [65]

Just to put it in perspective, in 2007 our satellite margin was 35.3%. Three years ago it was 38%. Last year it was 35.4%, year-to-date it's 35.2%. It has been in a very, very narrow band for quite a long time. We are actually at 36.3% this quarter, even with the reduction in services. So I think we are in that same band that we've always talked about [material]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [66]

Switching gears a little bit, TELUS -- you talked about that you're going to make some changes there with some capacity. In the past you've had some large one-time CapEx items and then some condo fees associated with it. Can you give us some sort of timing with respect to that satellite launching and what that gives you? And if it gives you anything different, then express when are you guys doing it together again?

Unidentified Company Representative   [67]

Well, the satellite is going to be launched in 2012. So it will be in service sometime in that timeframe. We don't have a specific date yet; it's under construction. It's 16 KU band transponders at 107. Jim, it's 107 (multiple speakers)?

Unidentified Company Representative   [68]

It's in our existing arc. And with MPEG 4, it's a tremendous amount of capacity. It's well over 100 HD channels

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [69]

The CapEx, though, for that -- does that come free, or does that come with launch, the one-time -- the one large time number?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [70]

No, we would say it's ongoing. Right?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [71]

Well, there's no CapEx until 2012

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [72]

Can you just give me some guidance? I don't know if I'm the only one on this, but on the cash taxes it was a little bit lower than what I thought this quarter. I am just trying to figure out what it's like for the year. Are we resetting the bar with what we should expect on the cash tax side for this year or not?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications - CFO   [73]

No, I think some of the things this quarter we are just truing up to our estimates for the full year. And so it was a little lower this quarter because of those. There are obviously some adjustments. We've done last year's tax returns. We've looked at the CCA. I think taxes will be somewhat lower than what we originally indicated, but we're still on track for roughly what you would expect

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions). Peter MacDonald, GMP Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [2]

Thanks. First, Jim, can you just talk about what the nature of your new role will be, if you will include any new duties in your Vice Chair role or are you stepping back? And was there anything specific that led you to decide to make the change?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chairman   [3]

Okay, well I guess we've been talking about this for pretty well just about the time that we've started really getting serious about Canwest. And, you know, we said that, you know, we are -- the roles are getting redefined a little bit, but certainly I'm here to work with Brad and certainly a lot of strategic stuff that I'm going to do. I will probably be involved in regulatory a little bit. I'm sure I'm going to be involved in finance and some of those kind of things. But I think that when we looked at it, I was 38 when I became CEO. And Brad is what -- 47, 48?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [4]

46, Jim

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chairman   [5]

46. So he's 46. So I just think that given what we've got in front of us, that it's a good time to put more legs under the weight of the load because the load is pretty big, you know

And so I think that we still have the strong management team. I think that me staying around is good and J.R. around is good, even though you know as Chairman, it will probably be a while. It's probably not a long time because he is 77 or 76. I can't even remember his age either. So -- but -- so I think we're just trying to move our succession along and show the market like how solid we are as a team, and how we think you should build a public company going forward and how we think we can bring more value by doing that

And it doesn't mean I don't get to look at the financials. It doesn't mean I can't get involved and actually, just so Brad does -- you don't say this to Brad, he still reports to me. So basically, kind of the team is changing a little bit and as we are bringing on new guys to kind of support us, I think it's a really, really right time to make the move

Now, could I have stayed another three or four years or five years? Yes is the answer. But still, I'm still not gone, so it's a good time to -- I call Peter and I -- we're calling ourselves -- my name is Jim Shepherd, and Peter's name is Peter Shepherd. And we are just here to help the Company and help Brad and the team and we will do that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [6]

Okay. Thank you, and congratulations to the both of you

Operator   [7]

Bob Bek, CIBC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [8]

Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess for Brad, or perhaps Jim, just on the heightened competition you talked about -- these are cable questions, primarily -- could you talk a bit about the landscape? I mean you've got a resurgent or at least a more advanced offering from your competitor Telus; you've seen some pressure from MTS as far as a more compelling offering. Can you talk just anecdotally how the coverage geographically of some of these new advanced telco offerings line up against you and how you've dealt with it. It appears that there's some pretty -- anecdotally there's some pretty aggressive price pressure in the market, and so your thoughts on pricing in this -- as the competition heats up. And then I have a second question on programming

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [9]

Okay, Bob, I'll start and maybe Jay will chime in. But there's no doubt that the activity and competitive activity has very much increased. As we know, Telus has a big footprint for their Microsoft Mediaroom. We see promotional activity certainly increasing, and certainly on a volume basis. But we also believe that, like anything, you have promotional activity that comes in and out of the market. We believe that there is a -- we have pricing power still in the market, and we have recently put in a rate increase that is a combination of some basic and Internet, but I can't give you quite dollar amounts to the bottom line just because repackaging and stuff doesn't quite equate to that. But we still feel comfortable with that

Listen, we believe that with another competitor in the market, there's an opportunity to be prudent. And listen, we all like to compete, but it's a balance of competing, growing and also returning on the financial side. Jay

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Group VP of Cable Operations   [10]

Yes, and just to amplify Brad's comment, I mean, certainly, there's lots of competitive activity in the marketplace. Today, in the middle of October, the marketplace is certainly less active than it was in the spring. Promotional pricing is simply less intense. And we are competitive -- we are committed to competing on a differentiated customer experience. And it certainly seems like our primary competitor is headed in the same direction

So we see a shift in the business as this evolves to a more mature competitive environment around providing value and choice for our customers, long-term value and choice and probably less of a role for short-term promotions in that package

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [11]

Yes, and I think just to add to that, from a guidance point of view, we've certainly factored in those promotional discounts going forward, so we're quite comfortable with what we're -- looking ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [12]

Okay, that's great. Thanks. You've also talked in your guidance about programming cost increases. Any color as far as what kind of numbers we are looking at on the programming side?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [13]

Well, certainly the costs have been increasing. And we still see them -- the costs increasing. As we know TSN is soon to be coming towards with a rate increase

An actual dollar amount, I can't quite give you because we renegotiated Sportsnet and Sportsnet One all-in-one deal for five years. And Mike, I don't know if you want to add anything to that

But, certainly, cost and pressure increasing in sports. We know that. We see the US and experience down there. And we're doing the things we need to do to make sure we are trying to balance all of that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [14]

Great, thanks. And just a clarification question or just a question for Steve I guess on taxes. You talked about the cash tax going up. Any rough guidance on an overall tax rate? And I know Canwest hasn't closed, but is there any tax implications of taking on the Canwest assets?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [15]

No, not that are a lot different from what we would expect ourselves. This year our effective cash tax rate was just a little bit over 29%. And for next year, we'd see it maybe going a little bit lower than that. And then on the Canwest side, I think it will be roughly the same

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [16]

Okay. That's helpful. Thanks very much. I'll leave it there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [17]

Tim Casey, BMO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [18]

Thanks. I just wanted to, once again, revisit the competitive activity. Your growth rate slowed considerably through the year, and you've guided lower next year. What confidence do you have that you can maintain that given what has happened over the last year?
  And then second question would be, will you be issuing any financial metrics after the Canwest approval, assuming it's approved this evening? Will we get another press release regarding metrics there? Or will you address that down the road? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [19]

Well, Tim, just to talk about the competitive activity, it's -- there's -- it's hot and heavy out there. We believe there's -- as we heard from Telus last week that there's opportunities to ensure that -- continue to compete and continue to make sure that there's a balanced approach to the market. But, it's something -- and if you look at Q3 to Q4 over the year, there's specialize activities. And when you look at, for example, the on-demand, we get a portion from events, a portion from movies. And when we look at Q3 to Q4, we had a lot less activity in Q4 than Q3, not to say we weren't under pressure and revenues have certainly declined somewhat

But when we look at CAD5 million decline or CAD6 million over a CAD1.7 billion, it's really not something that we feel is material. And -- but we are prepared to compete. We believe we have value in our services. We believe we create a great customer experience

We are committed to engaging our customers and ensuring that we do everything we can for every conversation we have, every house we visit. We visit a million homes a year. And every time, we can make sure we are -- connect to that customer and anything we can do, it just makes a better experience and makes them want to deal with us. And we all have the technology. We all have the money. We all have the commitment. So it's a matter of working to win that game every day

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chairman   [20]

What about that event day -- had pay-per-view and --

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [21]

Yes, and those events. So if you don't have USC and a couple of boxing events, that can easily add up to CAD5 million or CAD7 million in the quarter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [22]

So to be very specific on that, because there seems to be an over-concern on Q4, the on-demand portion really represented the revenue decrease alone. Jay has already talked about promotions and the fact that promotions were -- we were much more active in promotions in the third -- the fourth quarter. And since then, the promotional activity has gotten less rich and less active

And so a lot of what we are seeing there is a one quarter sitting. And as Brad says, it's a small number, a small CAD10 million over CAD1.7 billion of revenue. So those are some of the specifics related to Q4

I think one of the main things here to look forward to is that the guidance is generally ahead of what was expected in the market. And so, we factor the promotional activity in. There might be some extraneous additional stuff that we are not seeing today, but based on the discipline in the market, we're fairly confident with that guidance, and it's guidance I think from an EBITDA growth perspective that people -- it's better than what people had expected. And from a free cash flow side as well, it's very good

[Steve], on your second question with regard to the financials Canwest, we're not in the position today to actually release the Canwest financials because they still have a board until closing and they still have fiduciary obligations. We will have a small comment later on today if we issue a press release on the CRTC just with regards to multiple. And what our plan would be is to discuss that further in Q1, and at that time, we'd provide some guidance as well

 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [25]

Thanks very much. Thanks for taking my question. My question is for Brad. With you taking on the leadership role, I was wondering if you can spend a little bit of time and just maybe outline some of your key focus areas as you take on the CEO job

And then secondly, specifically on the wireless front, I'm wondering if you can provide us a little bit more details now on the plans for 2011, what you're spending on with respect to the CAD200 million rollout, maybe your choice on technology, etc

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [26]

Sure I would be happy to. Jeff, just to talk about a little bit, my background and you probably know a little bit. Started in the industry and started answering telephone calls to customers and worked through the customer service side. And, you know, it's so important to me about relationship and the relationship -- we don't have -- I don't have all the answers, but certainly around this table we do. And for me, it's key to make sure we have the strongest relationship not only with this team, but it's with the Company and beyond that

So, for me, we know what we need to do. I think what Jim has set us up here has been absolutely perfect to where we continue to take it. Many challenges in front of us; I realize that. But with the strong team around here and what we've been able to show and prove, it's just a matter of us continuing that

So for me, it's continuing to build those relationships not only within Shaw, but outside of Shaw and ensuring that together with the board's direction and working with Jim and J.R. and Peter and the whole team here, we're going to continue to be on top of our game. We're going to continue to make the decisions and investments to compete, to return dividends to our shareholders, and ensure that we are not going to wane off. Because there's a real focus of this team executing day in, day out and everything we do, and I think that's continuing proven quarter over quarter

So, you know, I'm in kind of day one here, and we have a nice process as we work towards the AGM and working with Jim and beyond that and ensuring that we are covering the bases that we need to. So, we have a good plan. We talked about it for a while. And so we know where we are going to go. We know what we're going to do. And, I'm comfortable in that regard

In regards to wireless, you know, we're looking. I can't really tell you exactly what we're going to do because there's a lot of other people listening on the line. We are accelerating retail. We are accelerating the power bills. We are working on building out the markets. And I can't give you any more information than that because we are certainly a very competitive environment

But we are on track, and we are excited about some of the opportunities we are seeing from Quebecor and their success out there, so we are looking forward to the opportunity to compete in the wireless sector

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [27]

And maybe just one quick follow-on with respect to wireless. I'm interested in your thoughts on whether this is purely a go-alone-type venture or this is something that perhaps some form of partnership with another player makes sense for you guys?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [28]

On a buildout or MVNO or --?

Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [29]

Oh, no, on the -- more on the buildout, on the infrastructure side

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [30]

I think we always look at opportunities to share costs and add (multiple speakers) if it makes sense and does it fit and does it fit into our strategy? And what's the endgame? And how does it all look? So I think we're always in open discussions with anyone

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [31]

Okay, thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [32]

Vince Valentini, TD Newcrest

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [33]

Thanks very much. A couple of questions. First, just to segue on the wireless -- I know you don't want to give away too much, but can you give us any sense of how far the CAD200 million takes you? Like, would that be two-thirds or so through your CapEx build for your territory? Or is that still tip of the iceberg? I just wonder if you can give us any sense, looking into 2012 I guess of how much more there would still be to spend?

Michael D'Avella,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Planning   [34]

Vince, it's Michael. The CAD200 million is a substantial number, and it does give us a fairly substantial build. Clearly, we're going to have to spend more as time goes on, but, it's a big chunk of it. There's no question about it. And, we've bought our core network as I think Brad has mentioned, and we're building infrastructure, which is obviously the key component here in terms of offering a wireless service

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [35]

Okay, fair enough. And the second one, maybe more for Steve, just the free cash flow breakdown, if you take the CAD550 million, about CAD300 million for the current dividend, and then take CAD200 million off for the wireless CapEx, you're down to about CAD50 million left. But then you're going to add some free cash flow from Canwest, which is immediately accretive as you say, so that remaining amount, is that when we should think of as being available for share buybacks over the next year? Or more dividend increases likely with that? Or would you just sit on that extra cash?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [36]

Well, that was a lot of numbers, Vince, but basically, the CAD550, yes, CAD200 of the wireless build takes you down to CAD350. And as I say, we're not providing guidance on Canwest today, but I think a lot of you looked at Canwest results, and you can sort of generally understand just how accretive they are going to be. And so we're still going to be close this year on dividends. We had a discussion at the board meeting on that. And we're going to defer a dividend decision until the second quarter of the year

But this is the sort of hinge point maximum investment in wireless. There will still be growth in the core businesses. And with Canwest coming on as strong as we expect it to, there's certainly great medium-term prospects for dividend increases here

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [37]

Okay. That's fair. And then one last one then. On cable CapEx, there's been a few questions on declining growth in cable and the competitive environment. I'm not sure it's declining that much, but if it does decline over time, can you give us some sense of how much lower CapEx can go? I mean you are still spending at around 20% intensity; it's well above what some of the big guys in the US are spending. Is there potential for significant declines from current rates down to 14%, 15% intensity if growth really does slow down a lot more?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [38]

I'm not sure. There are -- maybe some of the US players are doing it at that level, but up here, that would be a very low level of CapEx intensity

Part of the reason for the free cash flow number for this year is that we do expect core CapEx in cable and satellite to decrease a fair pace for this year. And, that's helping the free cash flow number, but there will still be buildout requirements. There is Internet capacity. There's some facilities building that we need to do. So there are still things in CapEx over the next couple of years. Getting down at that level of CapEx intensity, I don't see that in the near future

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [39]

Thanks so much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chairman   [40]

Doesn't the Internet stuff double, how long, for data transfers? Every year or no?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [41]

(multiple speakers) about every year

Operator   [42]

Glen Campbell, Bank of America Merrill Lynch

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [43]

Yes, thanks very much. A question for Brad, looking at the subscriber numbers, you did certainly better than consensus and you managed to keep cable growth positive this year. Looking ahead, how do you see the trade-off between wanting to continue to grow subscribers and wanting to preserve ARPU in terms of the way you want to approach the market? Is there a point at which you would rather let subscriber growth go negative and hold the line on pricing? How are you thinking about that?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [44]

Yes, it's a good question. There's -- it's a moving target as Telus has come at us through the summer here and stuff, we are constantly balancing the need for financial and as you say ARPU return with customer growth. And as I said to the guys, if you have a triple play customer come through and they are giving you CAD150, are you going to lose them or are you going to give them a break or give them an offer that you can save them?
  So, we're constantly looking at the type of customers moving across, what we need to do. But there's definitely things that you can go too far and you can give up too much, and so we're going to continue to find that balance and continue to work on that. But, we believe we can balance both and we believe we can still have a good financial return and ARPU growth along with some customer growth

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [45]

Okay, thanks very much. And I had a couple of numbers questions by way of follow up. First, you've laid out the spend so far on wireless, including interest and operating expense. Could you clarify whether those items were capitalized or expensed?
  And then going forward, once you launch service, would you expect to be amortizing your spectrum investment or not?
  And then finally, on the rate hike, you mentioned that it's a little more complicated than just a couple of [backs] per sub. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how to model the impact of your September 1 rate hike. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [46]

So Glen, back to your first question, the CAD200 million will all be capitalized. And we expect to have CAD20 million of interest expense attributable to wireless in 2011. Your second question was --?

Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [47]

The spectrum investment itself. Once you go into operation, would you expect to amortize that spectrum investment as some players are or not?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [48]

We're still looking at that and haven't concluded on it yet

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [49]

Okay, thanks. And then the -- how to think about the rate hikes from September 1 in terms of modeling them

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [50]

I think you are right in terms of not being able to take a pure rate card approach. At the same time as we've adjusted our pricing strategy, we've certainly launch some new triple play bundles that are certainly great long-term value and financially healthy for us, but you can't really necessarily add up all of the individual pieces

You are doing the math though, and the rate increases for September went very well. We did a CAD1 rate increase on basic, CAD1 on our discretionary TV packages that are really anchored with TV packages that included Tier 3 and CAD2 for Internet

And I think we have had a good response and certainly within historical realms to the rate increase

That having been said, the cautionary note is we continue to bundle triple play services into long-term bundles, and so you can -- it's hard to take the pluses without some of the minuses as you add up your rate card

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [51]

Okay. Could you give us a percentage on that as sort of a -- as a blended figure on that?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [52]

No. I think what we're seeing is just be careful that you don't plug all of that -- I wouldn't expect that to all flow through. There is a component of it which is related to bundling discounts, and we're spreading things out a little more strategically these days than in the old days when it was straight basic cable increases. So, take a little haircut off that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [53]

Okay, excellent. Thanks very much

We will make sure he comes back

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [58]

I just wanted to ask one or two quick follow-up questions. Earlier, there was a question about programming costs and instead of looking at it in dollar values, can you give us any sense of what sort of percentage growth or pressure you are seeing? When Bell announced the CTV deal, they were saying that costs were inflating about 10% per year, and I think it's a little bit higher than the US run rate. I was just wondering where it would be for you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [59]

Some of them are [still] in negotiations

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Michael D'Avella,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Planning   [60]

Yes, we are still in the negotiation phases with one of the most significant providers at this point, the sports providers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [61]

But if you looked back over the last couple of years, can you give us a ballpark on that by chance?

Michael D'Avella,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Planning   [62]

Not really

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [63]

Okay. One other clarification as well, for the rate hike on September 1, can you remind us when the last one was done? Was it the same time last year?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [64]

Yes, we've done some price tweaking throughout the year, both on some of our HD specialty packages and with bundles throughout the year. But it would generally be neutral, so it's been September 1 to September 1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [65]

Okay. And the last question just on enterprise telecom, in the last little while, I guess Rogers has bought a couple businesses, Blink Communications and Atria. Cogeco has their data services group and Videotron has a telecom business as well. I'm just wondering if Shaw has any aspirations of getting into the enterprise business. And I guess maybe, would you ever consider something like Allstream? I hear laughing in the background

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [66]

I didn't know what to say no to first. (multiple speakers). You know, you're never going to say no to no, but certainly from -- we're just not in a -- we see small, medium business as a real focus for us and real attention and how it expands from there. We have a Shaw business solutions which is fiber-based and tend to be a little bit more in the medium, maybe a little bit bigger. But there is -- we feel plenty of opportunity. That's our main focus right now for the next short while. And, not really would we be interested in Allstream at this point

I'm going to ask a question on the guidance language, and I would love to know what you would define as modestly in that description. I'm sure you're not going to tell me, but it sounds to me like --

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [72]

Okay. Well then that one is answered

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [73]

Well, alternatively maybe you would, Steve. I don't know. I've never gotten -- I've never successfully gotten you to define guidance

Looking at the two levers that you talked about, competitive pressures and programming costs, I'm getting the sense certainly looking at the results that competitive pressures are the bigger issue there. And there have been a lot of questions asked on this, I acknowledge. But the one that I really wonder about is, when you're in a market like cable overall has been, certainly in Canada where you have had a lot of pricing power for multiple years, and all of a sudden you know you're starting to get a lot more competition and there's been a lot of promotional pricing, can you describe whether your existing customers that have been with you a while are reacting to the promotional activity in the market and coming back and saying hey, I would like that too?
  I'm trying to get a sense of what risk the pricing is on your base as promotional activity becomes a bigger part of the selling cycle

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [74]

Well, let me say generally that we spend a lot of time thinking about this guidance and there are others out there who give the ranges of for example, 48% is one case. Another case is 0% to 6% for EBITDA. We don't think the range approach is necessarily that useful because it puts a lower floor on it which is you can still say you hit the lower floor, and that's really not the way we operate

So, by saying modestly, we are saying that it may be a couple points off that, but it's not going to be something like 4% or some very low number. And we will see how the year develops

What I think is important to understand though, is, as I said, don't read too much into the Q4 stuff because it was specific to the on-demand and a period of heavier promotional activity, which has since settled down

And one of the things that's important to understand for 2011 is that we do have some lumpy programming costs in 2011, so we've talked about Sportsnet. We've talked about TSN and the sports generally, and so there are some lumpy things that are flowing through here, which are as important in terms of their impact to the results as the competitive pressures. So I would not put competitive pressure as sort of the number one factor. I would say the two are sort of balancing out here as being challenges that we need to overcome

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [75]

Okay. And then just a quick follow-on on that, I mean you kind of commented on this; since the September 1 rate hike has gone through, I get the sense that there's not anything alarming on the churn front. Can you confirm that? You're not seeing greater churn than historically when rate increases have gone (multiple speakers)?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [76]

No; we're not seeing greater rate-increase-related churn in the marketplace. And I think to your comments, a couple of things on growth. One is, for sure, the promotional activity that you see in quarterly results tend to lag a quarter or two. And so you are seeing results -- promotional activity in the spring reflected in summer revenue results. And as we've indicated to you, I think we're in a much better place, much better place in October than we were certainly in March and April

The other piece of the pricing strategy that we haven't sort of spoken too much today is, Brad certainly alluded to the big opportunity on the business side, but beyond that, we are really changing the way we offer and package Internet from packaging based on speed to packaging that allow our customers to choose the right blend of speed and (technical difficulty). And so certainly as we go forward, we don't see the Internet business as maturing but kind of evolving from subscriber growth based on speed to revenue growth based on data. And we see a big opportunity for our business there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  National Bank Financial - Analyst   [77]

Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And one just final question for Steve, this might have been indicated somewhere else. I apologize if it has. Is it the Company's view that it will immediately refinance the CAD115 million of CW Media debt? Certainly you can pick up a nice arbitrage opportunity there?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [78]

Well, you know -- yes. Yes, that's in there. So the 8.7%, CAD400 million term loan that CW Media Group has, will be refinanced on closing. And so, we expect substantial interest savings on that. And we've put in place -- we have CAD1 billion liquidity facility that's our base facility. We put in an additional CAD500 million liquidity facility to be able to do that and to also give us adequate operating liquidity

 Rob Goff,  Northland Capital Partners - Analyst   [81]

Thank you very much. I want to extend congratulations on the changes today, guys

The first question would be on the wireless. You've addressed some of the advancements that you've done external to the Company into really the hardware and to the infrastructure. But can you also talk to what you've done on the systems and the -- the billing systems?

Michael D'Avella,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Planning   [82]

Rob, it's all part of the same bucket, so when we talk about infrastructure, we talk about our core network of back office systems, it's all part of the same bucket. Everything is moving in tandem here. We're doing things at the same time. So --

Rob Goff,  Northland Capital Partners - Analyst   [83]

Okay. And then switching to your progress in the SME marketplace, can you address the changes you've seen from the service offerings and the customer traction and what impact the DOCSIS 3.0 and the integrated Wi-Fi modems have had in the marketplace?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [84]

Yes, sure. I think we're having success -- for sure we're having success in both ends of the marketplace; Shaw business solutions continues to compete well with fiber-based solutions and PRIs and are seeing very nice customer growth. We see some opportunity in the voice play in that space. As we go to the cable-based products, we've really done a great job of maximizing the opportunity with the smallest of businesses, almost a micro-business situation, single-line replacement and growth on the Internet side

You know the opportunity for us over the next 18 months is to really deliver on that huge opportunity that exists between those two spaces and, anchored in both voice and data. And so, we're really just at the beginnings of taking advantage of that opportunity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Northland Capital Partners - Analyst   [85]

Maher Yaghi, Desjardins Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [89]

Yes, thank you for taking my questions. Just wanted to zero in on a metric I am trying to get some understanding on, in terms of your stand-alone high-speed Internet additions. In previous quarters, you've had very high success in your telephony and -- but the high-speed Internet net adds were generally not moving that much and still being positive. This quarter they -- you had a decline of CAD11,000. I was just trying to understand what really happened to drive that decline? Is it mainly customers who had only Internet with you guys switching back to Telus, or something else happened that explained that number?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [90]

Yes, I think there's a couple of moments. And to be clear you're talking about the Internet stand alone?

Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [91]

Internet stand alone, yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [92]

Yes, right. So if you look at that base traditionally which has always existed for us, those were customers that received, at one point, 75% of those customers got their TV service from ExpressView, their Internet service from Shaw and their phone service from Telus. And clearly, the environment has changed dramatically towards a single network in the home and triple play, and so absolutely that base is under attack from all sides, including from us. And we've certainly had great success anchoring that base through adding phone and TV to the base. And for sure, that base is coming under full attack from the other places that they are customers of. And so I think you've seen a mix of certainly some competitive losses because with the nature of bundling pricing, there's not the same value as a stand-alone customers as can be offered bundle. And then by the same token, some really good success on our side in converting Internet stand-alone into double and triple play

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [93]

Okay, thanks for that explanation. Can I just maybe follow up on that? Correct me if I'm wrong, but, high-speed usually has very high gross margins. What are your assumed guidance when you're talking about the CAD550 million? Are you assuming that continued losses on stand-alone Internet clients? Or do you think you've figured out a way to stand that decline for 2011?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [94]

And to be clear, those standalone Internet customers may -- probably the majority of them are still Internet customers of Shaw. They're just not standalone anymore

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [95]

They have another product

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Michael D'Avella,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Planning   [96]

Yes, we have just converted them

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [97]

We have up-sold them, I think is to be clear

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [98]

Right. There's a portion of that --

Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [99]

But there's a portion that you lost because in previous quarters, you didn't have these big declines while you still had increases in cable and telephony

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [100]

Yes. No, we certainly understand your point of view, and it's not wrong. The single play customer is absolutely the most exposed customer competitively

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [101]

For us

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [102]

For us and for the other guys too. I mean we can take their single play customers absolutely the easiest, right?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [103]

That's why we bundle

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [104]

Yes, exactly. It's a bundle approach

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [105]

So you figured -- in your guidance, you assume that this trend will continue?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [106]

I --

Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [107]

Maybe if I switch off on a different topic, just a final question, on IFRS, I understand some of your telco competitors and cable competitors will announce IFRS implications when they announce their Q3 results. Have you made any kind of quick review of your financials to see if IFRS will have a large impact on your reporting?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [108]

No, it's not going to have a large impact on our reporting, and we can provide more details later. But there are certain elements like borrowing costs which will have to be capitalized now

On the employee benefits side, there's actuarial losses I think everybody will elect to treat a certain way, and everybody I think is being consistent in that

And then the only other one that's major is simply for an accounting thing in that you used it to actually depreciate intangible assets like licenses, and then that stopped, so you have to go back and reinstate what you previously depreciated. So these are all really just accounting things, and there's nothing that we expect that's going to be significantly different in terms of reported results

 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [109]

Okay. Thank you very much

Dvai Ghose, Canaccord Genuity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [111]

Yes, thanks very much. Let my add my congratulations to Jim and Brad. And Jim, it's been a little over 12 years. I'm sure the CRTC is very happy that you will still be involved with regulatory

So, here's my question. So first of all, if I look at your guidance, now, I appreciate all the reasons why Q4 may have been unusually weak, but you did about 7.5% revenue growth, which I assume organically is near a 5.5% if you exclude the Mountain Cablevision. And, your margins have been flat for really since mid-2008. So you are talking about some improvements next year versus this. And your main issue seems to be that promotional pricing will be less of an issue next year than this. But what gives you the confidence? I mean you raped and pillaged Telus's and MTS's and [Sasktel's] telephony bases with low pricing. Why wouldn't they keep doing that to you on the TV side?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [112]

Well, I don't think first of all, you can characterize our pricing in the telephone side as being raping and pillaging. I think it's being absolutely very disciplined

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [113]

Well, I didn't say the pricing. I said that your impact

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chairman   [114]

Yes, I would say -- Brad he probably has got to be able to chime in, but I would say that they've been more undisciplined on pricing than we have. And only -- when it takes you two years before you can even tell a subscriber number out of them, and we're pretty well full disclosure, I mean I would say they have been the ones that have been kind of raping and pillaging and we've been the ones that have been accountable and more disciplined in the market than them

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [115]

And also remember that you are going to have new offers and other offers that you are trying and testing and moving as things the whole market is changing. Some have more success than others, and that's going to be reflective

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [116]

Yes, I guess my only point is the telcos don't seem to view TV as being an immediate profitability pool, but more of a strategic thing in terms of trying to get symmetry by taking away your TV customers because you take away their voice customers. So I'm not at all clear why they wouldn't continue to proportionately price. And I completely agree with you, Jim, they have had aggressive promotions on the TV side. My question is why would it stop?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [117]

Well, I'm not sure. I don't think it will. I think you're going to come -- quarter by quarter, everyone wants to continue to grow and you're going to see that. It's a matter of -- I'm not sure what Telus is doing. We're not around their table and what we're doing. We react to the market and what's going on, and respond that way

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chairman   [118]

And don't you think, Brad, that hopefully down the road, that with financial prudence and them having subscriber or shareholders too, that they don't have to one day say we have to have a return on this investment. So promotional -- really heavy promotional discounts -- it's hard to provide that and have the margin too

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [119]

I think, Dvai, you made a good point, that the profitability of TV for them is certainly not what it is for us in phone. So, a return to a more rational environment makes a lot of sense. And one of the things about Telus is that they are a very financially disciplined company. And so, we respect them as a competitor, but we also know that they understand the importance of balance and we are trying to balance, and the importance of financial return

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [120]

No, fair enough. Second question on guidance has really to do with CapEx. Now I understand the assumption is as cable matures, the CapEx goes down. That hasn't been the case with wireline telecom. And I guess my question here is, if you ask the telcos to play devil's advocate, they will say they've got a better IPTV product than your cable because it's switch video; they've got media gateways which allow you to program your PVRs with wireless, one PVR for the whole home; MPEG-4 encoders in their boxes; and that perhaps you would have to spend a fair bit to play catch-up. How would you react to that?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [121]

Peter and I were jumping in with the same answer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [122]

Yes, I think that second question answers the first, Dvai, which is I think you see both sides saying that we're going to compete on the customer experience, and with our technology roadmap, which is fully funded in our capital plan, we're going to continue to be the leader in our marketplace in terms of delivering customer experience

And they understand the feature list that you just rattled off. We're in good shape in terms of those features and beyond that. Our roadmap really focuses on a leapfrog approach from a customer experience side. So if it's a battle for customer experience, which is absolutely the battle we want to have, that's awesome

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [123]

Great. And then last one is really quick and factual. You obviously did very well on the SMB side. Can you tell us how many VoIP as well as Internet adds you've got on that side?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [124]

We don't have the number right in front of you. It's similar to previous quarters -- light

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [125]

So sort of 10,000 VoIP add sort of thing?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [126]

Yes, you might be just a hair over that, but it's just a hair over that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Gober,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst   [129]

Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Just a couple on wireless. And in particular, I was just curious what you have taken away from the early launches of new competitors, including Videotron and Wind, and how that's kind of influenced your build activity. And obviously the CapEx spend that you guys are guiding to for fiscal 2011 is robust and clearly indicative of a robust network. But also curious what the consumer offering is going to look like and how the negotiations of handset providers and things like that are going so far

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Michael D'Avella,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Planning   [130]

The -- what we've taken away from the Videotron launch in particular is that the importance of having a complete very robust network is certainly the way to go. And we've always believed that was the case, and certainly we are on a track to build a network with excellent coverage and excellent capacity. And, we're designing it in such a way that we will have one of the most robust and probably one of the most capable networks when we're ready to go

We are very, very encouraged by what we see on the handset side. The AWS handset ecosystem is very healthy. A lot of devices are coming. Videotron has proven that there's a lot of leading edge, certainly with android-based devices. They've got the Nexus One phone which we understand they've sold out fairly quickly. So, we're very encouraged on that front as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [131]

And we're also encouraged in terms of the way that they are -- customers are able to actually access this product through Internet, retail

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Michael D'Avella,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Planning   [132]

Absolutely

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David Gober,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst   [133]

I guess that's another question I had for you, any sense of what your retail strategy is going to be in terms of partnerships or anything to that extent?

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chairman   [134]

One of the things that I would add though is that all the new incumbents, not Shaw, you know, and not -- certainly not Videotron, start off with a base of customers that's very, very large. And so we already have a relationship with our customers. So with us, it's what 3.4 million or something? So we already have that. Videotron is like 1.8 million. And so we already have a relationship, so that will allow Jay and the team and Brad and everybody to leverage into those customers and take advantage of that and make it a total Shaw

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [135]

Yes. And just to add to that, David, we realize the importance of retail and the importance of retail in wireless, and so our plans will be addressing that

(Operator Instructions). Tim Casey, BMO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [2]

Two questions. One, I know you've been fairly consistent, so you take a disciplined approach to launching new products. But could you provide us with any more details or color as to the reasons for the delay in the launch of wireless? I know it's just three months, but investors are focusing on that

And second, could you talk a little bit about your ARPU mix? ARPU was up nicely again in the quarter, and there is some concern about pressures on your ARPU. I'm wondering if you could just help us out on what continues to drive ARPU so early this year. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [3]

I'll start with the wireless, and one of the other guys can jump in on the ARPU

I guess, Tim, a couple things on wireless. One, for sure, it is strategic for Shaw. And we are committed to rolling out wireless. We are not stopping getting towers in acquisition, but we certainly feel we need a disciplined approach to the business and ensuring that as we go along, we are learning and we're understanding how the market works in the wireless customer, because there is some differences there for us

But we're excited about the opportunity. And our track record in everything we've done before with new products is that market-by-market disciplined approach, and we see this as no different

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Operations, SCI   [4]

I think in -- Tim, it's Jay -- in terms of ARPU, there's a number of positive forces happening in the marketplace. Certainly, as we step up promotionally and add customers at higher price points, that's going to help us with our focus on everyday value

The other thing that you may not be able to see as clearly is we are really differentiating a number of our products up-market. And certainly, within the Internet space, there has been really nice movement from Lite to High-Speed and from High-Speed to Extreme, and a little bit more interest in some of our higher-end products like Warp. So we see lots of upside on the Internet side differentiating up-market

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [5]

Is the delay in wireless, is it an issue beyond your control? Is it with respect to acquiring equipment, or is it purely your call?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Operations, SCI   [6]

Well, we've always had this plan to build out on this process and take these steps. But it is our call. And we feel very comfortable with this approach. And the Board feels comfortable, and that's how we're going to pursue it

 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [9]

I have some questions on the media side, perhaps for Paul Robertson, more on the operational. Can you give us any commentary at all on how you're seeing the ad market respond to the change in ownership, and just commentary generally on the conventional? We see a lot of specialty commentary out there, but there's not much conventional commentary in the public markets these days. So, Paul, perhaps give us a bit of an update on what you are seeing from advertisers in response and in demand

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Group VP, Broadcasting, and President, Shaw Media   [10]

Sure, Bob. Thanks for the question. Yes, first of all, from an overall standpoint, as you know, the advertising industry has been growing, a really nice bounceback. The first quarter, we saw overall growth of the industry at about 7.5 or 8 points. And we beat that with a plus 10

What was really encouraging about first-quarter results is that conventional within that mix was really, really strong. And we had [over 7%] growth in global TV, which was really, really terrific

And, yes, we really do believe that the programming is strong, the assets are strong, but I think we're also getting an ownership now in that conventional number. And it's really because a year ago at this time, if you think, the assets were in [TCAA] and people didn't know when they invested in global what was going to happen. And now with Shaw ownership, everybody feels that very strong sense of stability. So our customers have no reason not to invest wholeheartedly

So all the fundamentals are right, and then there's a little bit of bounce on top of that. So it's very encouraging

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [11]

Could I ask, geographically, are you seeing -- what kind of split are you seeing bewteen the West and the East on the health of the demand?

Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Group VP, Broadcasting, and President, Shaw Media   [12]

It's pretty even. But because automotive was up nicely, it tends to have an Ontario factor to it. So Ontario was particularly up. The other category that was up was retail. But, again, that was kind of more typically across the country. And we're seeing a pretty even recovery

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [13]

Okay. And you had a good response, even with, obviously, the upfront market was a bit confused, I guess, with the ownership change. Do you feel you have some opportunity for upside there as you get some legs under the programming and have it under your control?

Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Group VP, Broadcasting, and President, Shaw Media   [14]

Well, the upfront, I think we were pretty successful in marketing in the upfront. By the time we got to that point in time, I think people were getting a sense that it was headed towards ownership by Shaw

But, really, the key now is the way in which the programming fares in the marketplace. And we've been pretty fortunate, by the way. The new program -- the existing programs have held on. We've got about three or four of the top 10, and we've got a new program in the top 15

So we're in good shape there. We have a couple of new ones coming on. They both happen to slot nicely into simulcast, which is perhaps more good luck than good planning. But this is all good. And we think that we will continue to get -- be able to continue to show these kind of revenue lifts as the year proceeds. We certainly know as we get into the second quarter that we are having a similar kind of growth track that we had in the first quarter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [15]

 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [17]

I have a couple of questions. Maybe, Paul, I'll keep you on here first. You mentioned Q2. I'm wondering how big an impact the Olympics on CTV would have had on global's revenue in February of last year. Is there a possibility for a big snapback?

Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Group VP, Broadcasting, and President, Shaw Media   [18]

Well, no, we really didn't see a huge Olympic effect on the global numbers a year ago. So, no, we wouldn't expect any kind of an extraordinary change

As I say, we're kind of looking at more of the same that we experienced from a growth standpoint as in Q1. If we can -- if we meet those Q1 growth results, then we will be really happy. But we are in that sort of range

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [19]

Okay. A wireless question as well. I don't know if -- maybe for Mike D'Avella, if he's there. The CapEx that you've spent so far, is it all just sort of on site preparation and towers, or are you actually buying base stations and putting those out in any sort of significant fashion at this point?
  And if you are, I assume those must be HSPA stations. So is there any -- that probably leads to the question you can probably imagine I'm trying to get at. If you are delaying, are you thinking in the back of your mind about an LTE network now, or are you still going forward with HSPA?

Michael D'Avella,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Planning   [20]

So, Vince, the CapEx that we've spent today is really around core network and the IT systems that are required to support a wireless launch. It also includes, obviously, the radio systems and base stations that will reside on various poles and towers. So it's all those elements

And, yes, what you buy today essentially is HSPA+ with a migration path to LTE. But if you were to turn [off] the network tomorrow, it would kind of be HSPA+

We are not waiting for LTE. There is a logical migration, which will be driven largely by the requirements of the massive (technical difficulty) the US and other countries. So when the time comes, and we've already made the investments in terms of infrastructure, we're going to be well positioned to migrate to LTE. And there are other factors in terms of what you're going to have by way of [stack room] at that time. 700, as you know, is coming. We don't know exactly what the auction timeframe is going to be. But that's another consideration in terms of LTE planning

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [21]

But suffice to say, whatever you build now, whatever money you spend, you wouldn't be wasting it if you had to quickly move to LTE two years down the road. You would be building something that's forward-compatible?

Michael D'Avella,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Planning   [22]

Absolutely. We don't -- we never waste money

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest - Analyst   [23]

Okay. And then last question; I don't know if this is for Steve, or if Brad wants to chime in. But in terms of cable EBITDA growth and how it progresses through the year, you've noted you had these pretty aggressive promotions through most of last year, and those had a bit of a drag impact on your ARPU and margins. You saw 5% EBITDA growth in your cable business in Q1

As the timing progresses through the year, and you start to compare against some of those Q3 and Q4 quarters when you already had the aggressive promotions in there, is it fair to say probably your EBITDA growth gets a little bit better on a year-over-year basis with each passing quarter?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Operations, SCI   [24]

Yes -- it's Jay again. I think it's broadly fair to say what you just said. If you look at the 12-month period, certainly you see 12-month promotions coming off. We moved to six-month promotions last July, and we keep coming up on price in terms of those promotions

So as you see the effect on EBITDA, you don't really have customers coming -- well, customers are coming on on much less promotion. You really don't have customers coming off. So I think your timing there is broadly defined correct

And of course, we'll be anniversarying the current competitive environment, or perhaps an environment that was even more competitive last spring, as we come into it next spring, whereas today, we are kind of anniversarying numbers that are a different competitive environment

But you've seen our guidance, and we can see our guidance, too, and certainly, the model works throughout the fiscal year. And we're going to be there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [25]

So I would just add, Vince, that in terms of the margin question, in the first quarter, we did 46.7% last year. We're reporting 45.9% in cable this year. About CAD6 million of that difference was an accrual that was based on a CRTC decision with regard to methodology and allocation of pole rates, which is a retroactive accrual that we've made in the quarter that goes back to a year ago last July. So that is in our number for the quarter

And if you added that back, we come back to about the 46.7% that we had last year and 7% cable growth. And as, I think, important, as Jay pointed out, we're still on -- we still are confident in our guidance at this point in the year, barring some unusually heavy promotional activity that's more than what we're seeing today. And that guidance of just modestly under 7.5% for cable and satellite is one of the strongest in the North American market

 Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [28]

First, a question on wireless, a forward-looking question. Michael, you talk a little bit about what you've spent so far. You've got CAd150 million to CAD200 million budgeted for the current year. Could you talk a little bit about where you expect to be at the end of the fiscal year, and sort of the types -- the areas you'll be doing the spending?

Michael D'Avella,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Planning   [29]

Well, it's essentially network build. We haven't been specific about the coverage area, but we're talking about launching our first major market by the first quarter of next year. So if you're talking about building network here, that's really what the capital is all for. [The right] acquisition is a big element. If you want to build a robust AWS network, you need a lot of sites, and that's what we're focusing on right now

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [30]

Okay, thanks. And a follow-up on wireless. Could you talk long term about what sort of market share and ARPU expectations it takes to make this investment work from a Shaw standpoint?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [31]

Well, I think we're a little early in that, Glen. It's pretty hard to say when we've got just a little bit of a jigsaw puzzle in front of us, as we're seeing things. But as things change here as we go forward, we continue to be clearer. But it's moving pieces; it would be hard for us to say right now what exactly that looks like going forward

(multiple speakers). Well, go ahead. Next question

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [32]

A quick one on high-speed Internet. You mentioned a positive trend in terms of people migrating to higher tiers. Could you talk a little bit about the dynamic there? Is it a question of people incurring overage charges and then deciding that they are better served, or looking at overcharges or better served, or is it just a question of them deciding it's worth the higher monthly to be at the higher tiers? Or it is kind of promotionally driven?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [33]

No, it's actually experientially driven, Glen. This is Peter Bissonnette. And as more and more customers are streaming more and more video content, they recognize that the lighter speeds that we attribute to our Lite-Speed Internet doesn't have the same experience that you have at our High-Speed or our Warp speed kind of Internet

And to the extent that we are seeing almost doubling, if you will, of the kind of streaming traffic that our customers are enjoying, they're seeing the benefits of -- first of all, there's a reliance now, greater than there ever has been, on having an Internet service that is robust and fast. And we are seeing the benefits of that as customers move up through the various tiers of services

We haven't, in fact, started -- we're just starting the usage-based approach to things, and so we really haven't seen the effect of that on customers who maintain the same speed here and are paying overages. That's not happening. What we're seeing is they're moving to the higher level of services, just to get that great experience

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [34]

Okay. Thanks very much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [35]

Jeff Fan, Scotia Capital

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [36]

Just a follow-up on the high-speed question. I'm wondering if you can give us a mix of the type of subscribers on various buckets of speed, just kind of some general understanding of where people -- or where their speeds are at, at the moment, in each various level, and what the ARPUs are on Internet at the moment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [37]

That's a great question, Jeff. And as you know, we've always resisted providing kind of a breakout of the various tiers of services. And so I think we'll continue to take that approach

We are happy with the mix that we have, and we are happy with the way that customers are moving from lower speeds, whether they were old traditional high-speed up into Nitro and Warp speed Internet. But as Jay has indicated earlier, we're seeing that kind of reliance translate into higher ARPUs on Internet

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [38]

Okay. And on the (multiple speakers) -- oh, sorry

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [39]

I'm just trying to give you from a, certainly from a retail perspective, our opening price point is CAD28 a month on Lite bundled; High-Speed, which is our 7.5-meg service, is CAD38. So we are little less in Eastern Canada. And Extreme, which is where we are seeing all the positive amount on our 15-meg service, is CAD48. So there is great value for a customer in a bundle at that CAD48 Internet

We're also seeing some nice, interesting movement on Warp at CAD98, which is a 50-meg service. And it's early days for that, but we think that could be a relevant product as we continue to differentiate up-market

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [40]

Just a quick question on the caps. Are there customers based on -- now that you've introduced the cap that actually have the average usage that are above the cap?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [41]

There are some, yes. And those were customers (technical difficulty) may in fact be at a Lite-Speed service right now that recognize that -- first of all, the caps are pretty generous. So we've tried to introduce them in a way that is as consumer-friendly as possible, and provide really opportunities, not punishment

And so there's an opportunity for a customer to -- because most of us, a year ago, wouldn't really know how much we're consuming. So we've really spent some considerable amount of time educating our customers in terms of just saying, this is how big your fuel tank is, and this is what you can do with it

And now, with the proliferation of streaming video in that, they are now starting to experience that and are then subsequently making the decision whether they want to buy an extra CAD10 worth of usage, which gives them quite an amount of headroom, frankly, from what they already have, or if they would want to step up to the next tier

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [42]

Great. And then just one more question on wireless. When we sit back and take a look at the number of networks that are being constructed out West in some of your core markets, I'm just wondering, when you look out, do you see any opportunities to work with other wireless operators in order for you guys to be, as, Brad, you pointed out, to be more disciplined in terms of your capital spend going forward?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [43]

I would think that was something you would look at, depending, and it's not as simple as that. Tends to be a lot of other [asks and] doing different things. But I think if there is an opportunity to cobuild and share costs, that does make sense. I know there's a lot of activity right now with some of the new entrants and the incumbents on power-sharing and doing that type of thing. But we are certainly open to that

 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [46]

Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could elaborate on the competitive environment you're seeing for the cable business that you've alluded to -- I guess unusually intense competition. So just to clarify, is this more intense than what you've seen last year, or just a continuation of the existing competition we've seen in the past?
  And my second question is just a quick follow-on on the dividend increase. I was under the impression on the last quarterly call that an increase decision was to be deferred until the second quarter. So the increase today is certainly a pleasant surprise for me. So I just want to I guess just clarify what's changed in management's thinking or expectations to allow for this earlier dividend increase announcement since our last call. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [47]

I'll take the competitive environment question. Yes, certainly, on a year-over-year basis, the competitive environment has shifted. We are not necessarily seeing a huge increase in activity as you look on a month-over-month basis in terms of the competitive environment

We are five years into competing with some form of [TeleCV] and we're eight years in competing with [Mcast]. And so I think we are hitting a bit of a maturation process at the current levels

I think what you're also seeing is it's not that hard to expand the market through promotional pricing on both sides. And so as both sides do a little less promotion, the total size of the television market shrinks a little bit. And I think you're seeing that in our numbers as well. So I think it's a combination of, for sure, intensification year over year in competitive activity, if not month over month, and really our focus on everyday value and the customer experience

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [48]

And, Phillip, on the dividend increase, we've talked in previous calls quite extensively about the fact that we understand the importance of maintaining dividend increases, even at lower levels, in times like this. Our Board consider this

And when we look at where we're at today, we've got CAD550 million of free cash flow from our core business. We're going to report 10 months of media at CAD60 million. But really, for the full year, we're going to generate CAD100 million of free cash flow from media. That puts us at (technical difficulty) million

Even subtracting a full CAD200 million off of wireless, we're down to CAD450 million. The increase that we've implemented today takes our dividend run rate from CAD380 million up to CAD400 million. And as I said, we think that consistent dividend increases are important, even on a smaller scale, and support the very large income-oriented investor base that we have

 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [49]

Yes, your [talent] contribution was certainly very encouraging. Thanks

 Rob Goff,  Northland Capital Partners - Analyst   [51]

Thank you for taking my question. Could you address the [scheme] marketplace and what sort of adoption levels you're seeing there, and what sort of products are working and what products may be in the pipeline?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [52]

Well, I'll maybe start, and maybe Jay could add. I'll just, at a high level, it's something that we have probably been a little bit lagging behind some of the other cable operators in North America and the opportunity, and thus we've done a little realignment in our senior management team. And under Jay's leadership of building our business plan to take a good stab at that, because it's a real growth opportunity for us, there's good margins, and we think it's the next focus for us from growth

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP, Operations, SCI   [53]

Sure, and just to amplify on Brad's remarks, we probably don't have our share of this market yet, and we are completely focused on getting the share of this market. As we've talked about on previous calls, we've really done a good job at single-line voice replacement in the business space and marketing to the smallest of businesses

And then Shaw Business Solutions, in a very price-disciplined way, has participated in the fiber-based market. This past quarter, we brought those two organizations together into a single Shaw business organization

And I think as we move one face of business for Shaw forward, we will have an opportunity to take a much larger share of that marketplace. That having been said, our current approach is not to be disruptive on price. We believe that we can differentiate on service in this space as well. And the PRI-based product?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [54]

We absolutely have PRI-based products in the disruptive IP technology. Our timing is perfect in that space as well. So there's lots of opportunity, as I think is well known in the marketplace, for us to become a much more major player in the business space

Maher Yaghi, Desjardins Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [57]

Thank you for taking my questions. First question, I just wanted to ask about the cable business and the promotional activities you were talking about. When we look at your basic subscriber numbers, is it fair to assume that -- it seems that discounting has become necessary in order to attract customers. And looking at your assumptions, you're saying that you don't expect discounting, or much, for -- in the near future. So should we assume that these subscriber numbers should continue to be -- net additions to be negative going forward, or maybe you can explain why net additions were negative for basic cable subs in the quarter?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [58]

I don't think we would agree with the statement that we should assume that negative basic customers is the approach that's going forward. We think that customers have historically joined the cable business on some form of a promotion as an on-ramp to pricing

And certainly, in the competitive world, the same has been true on the other side. And on the other side, maybe the offers have even been more aggressive over the years

I think take the current flow that we see is very, very encouraging in the business, which is to have customers on-ramp at a very small discount. It lowers churn. It lowers our acquisition costs and will provide a nice benefit for us

But we are happy to compete as much as we need to compete. And if the other guy goes the other way, you could see some spectacular subscriber numbers from Shaw. And if you saw those, you'd probably see a short-term bounce in financials, too, because that's how it works. But we are interested in the medium- and long-term financial performance

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [59]

So -- okay, that's helpful. So we should not expect any discounting in order for you to show positive net additions going forward. Is that what you're saying, basically?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [60]

That's somewhat twisted from [the way] I heard it. No, I think the discounting will be still in the business going forward. To what degree --

Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [61]

That's exactly my point. What degree should we assume? Because as it stands right now, if discounting stays the same, do you still expect net additions to turn positive? Is that what you're saying?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [62]

No. We've already moved up in price, and that's reflected in our results. I'll give you some context that we are not talking around it. So, today, if you're a new Internet customer, while most of our Internet customers pay CAD38 a month, today you could sign up for the Internet with us and get up to CAD29.95 a month for the first six months. So there is an CAD8 benefit over a course of six months for you to sign up and enjoy the Internet service compared to kind of where customers traditionally fall out. And there are some ins and outs and features, and you can't look at it --

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [63]

(multiple speakers) had a bundling advantage, and that's been one of the ways we've sold our products from years gone by, is that if you take three products, the cost of each individual product is discounted as a benefit to you taking those three products. And that's going to continue to be so

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [64]

And we make good money on that entry customer, CAD29.95. I think as you saw last spring, you saw offers certainly on both sides of the table that were significantly richer than that, both in terms of timeframe and definitely in terms of offers. So I know it's hard to sort of see from the outside looking in, but that really is a sense of the flavor of what's happening in terms of how we are on-ramping customers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [65]

Okay, great. And just a question, finally, on media. I'm trying to reconcile the fact that in Q1, you posted CAD40 million of free cash flow, yet for the full year you're forecasting free cash flows of CAD50 million, or it's still CAD75 million excluding the CRTC benefit obligations. Can you maybe tell us if the decline or the seasonality will be more impacting the revenue line or the cost line? Is there any excess costs that you expect to incur to get programming that we should be looking for maybe in Q2, Q3?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [66]

Let me just answer the financial question first; then maybe Paul can comment, if you'd like to

The CAD40 million, yes for the first month. For the full year, we're expecting the 10-month contribution to be CAD50 million. Part of that is the seasonality, as we will see our revenue drop in the second quarter, which is normal for the business, and usually the same thing in Q4 with the stronger Q3

But one of the things in the first quarter that I think is important to take into account is that there was very little spending on CRTC benefits, only CAD4 million on CRTC benefits and a very small amount on capital. So the CRTC benefits for the year are expected to be CAD30 million, and they're essentially back-end loaded now in that 10 months, as well as the CapEx as well. So that's part of what's driving that flatness in free cash flow for the remaining 10 months

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [67]

Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you

Dvai Ghose, Canaccord Genuity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [69]

Steve, I just wanted to revisit the guidance question a bit. There was all sorts of puts and takes in Q1 '10 and Q1 '11. So if you can help normalize, because your guidance is predicated on slightly less than 7.5% EBITDA growth for the core cable and satellite segment. You reported 4.4% today. Now, I understand there's a CAD6 million extraordinary because of the ILEC charge, but there was only one month of Mountain Cablevision in fiscal Q1 '10. So doesn't that essentially offset -- wasn't that about four-point-something million? And so how do you ramp from let's say sub-5% to nearly 7%?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [70]

Sorry, what period am I ramping from 5% to 7%?

Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [71]

Well, all I'm saying is if you offset the CAD6 million in this period, but also offset the fact that you only had Mountain Cablevision for one month in the year-ago Q1 period, isn't the EBITDA growth rate pretty similar to what was recorded?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [72]

Well, yes, I understand what you're saying about the CAD6 million in cable. But for the balance of the year, we still expect subscriber growth. We've got benefits of rate increase going through for the balance of the year. And there are a number of other things. We talked about the ARPU ramp in Internet growing throughout the year, the introduction of usage-based billing

So there are other expectations that we have here for revenue. Hopefully, we'll get some more discipline in the market with our competitor on promotional activity, and that will support the overall guidance for the year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [73]

Fair enough. And when it comes to the free cash flow guidance for the core, again, cable and satellite, this CAD550 million, you only did CAD105 million in Q1. So it's mainly EBITDA growth that you think will generate the CAD550 million as opposed to lower CapEx; it wasn't an unusually high CapEx in this quarter, or was it?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [74]

No. It would only be under CAD200 million for -- excluding wireless

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [75]

Right, fair enough. And then my question on wireless is this. I understand the prudence in terms of taking a measured approach, and you obviously want to launch a very good service, and you don't want to debase your brand. But by waiting, don't you run a couple of risks, such as increased penetration -- obviously, Western Canada has very high penetration relative to the rest of Canada -- but also losing mandated roaming in 2014, which doesn't give you very much time to build a ubiquitous network in your footprint?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [76]

Well, I'll start, Dvai, and maybe Mike can jump in. Our plan was always to take a disciplined approach to launching wireless and ensuring we could learn the business and create that great experience. And we have the benefit of starting from the beginning. And I think with Shaw's reputation, our service, our focus on the customer, the leveraging of all the services we have, we feel comfortable that there's good opportunities as we see data moving and all the opportunities there

We are comfortable that we can continue to grow, and grow that wireless. But we're going to be disciplined in that approach and we're going to be disciplined in our costs. And everything you expect from Shaw, you're going to continue to see

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [77]

Fair enough. And my last question -- I asked it on the last call -- maybe you could give us some more detail. The telcos that you compete against -- Telus, MCS, etc. -- the Mediaroom platform they tried to differentiate in terms of one PVR for the whole home, and remote PVR, and you've said on your last call that it was something you've worked on, I was wondering if you could give us some idea as to where you are in that process in terms of building media gateways and how long you think it would take?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [78]

That's an excellent question, Dvai. And I don't know if you were at the CES recently in Las Vegas. But we were certainly there, and we were delighted that the development that we have been fully engaged in for the last six or seven months to develop a whole-home media gateway has been -- will be translated in the next couple of months into a product that, frankly, will leapfrog the competitors that are in our service areas

And I'll give you an example of some of the benefits that we've seen. And we actually saw them at the CES, which are being embraced by the likes of Xfinity and Time Warner, etc. But we're looking at a centralized home gateway system that will incorporate six digital cable tuners, as well as those six digital cable tuners which can all operate discretely and independently and have -- provide customers with access to a whole host of services

We're also -- it will conclude numerous high-speed data interfaces, the capability to support up to six high-definition television services that call all function at the same time without interacting with each other, which is one of the limitations on the Mediacenter. The graphics-based user interface is something that we're really excited about. And I don't know if you -- were you in the CES --

Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [79]

No, I wish I was, especially if it was in Vegas

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [80]

(multiple speakers) It was like candy to our eyes, because the user interface that we're going to be looking at will allow us to -- customers to really find movies, sports, on-demand, favorite programs, with a guide that takes us out -- takes us into a realm that is only heretofore kind of dreamed about

The PVR can utilize all six tuners. There's data interfaces. And then the great news is -- some will call me a heretic for this, but the great news is that we're also then going to be moving into, very shortly after the launch of this product, into an IP-based home networking over ethernet, over WiFi and over MoCA, so that all of the -- as you know, DLNA is now a standard that's to be built into all television sets, which allows the home gateway network to basically pull within the home all of the devices, like hard drives, where you store your movies and your pictures and your music and those kind of things, and bring those onto the PCs, the laptops, the smartphones

And as you know, that was one of the drivers, if you will, for Canwest, which is the multiplatform distribution of content. And so this device that we're launching in the springtime will be essentially the facilitator for all of those strategies that we've talked about before, and we'll now have an ability to realize those. So we're going to be into the IP space. We're going to have a hybrid IP box. And we believe that it takes us into the elite again, if you will, in the home gateway architectures

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'd love to tell you, but I'd have to be shot. We do have a confidentiality agreement with them now. But I can tell you that they're a very credible builder that has demonstrated to us, by virtue of the development that they have done, that they were up to the task

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [85]

Okay. Switching to media, when you made the -- you originally announced the acquisition, you spoke about needing to normalize the EBITDA for bankruptcy. I'm wondering if these numbers need to be normalized for that as well

 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [86]

You're talking about the year-over-year comparative?

Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [87]

Well, the numbers in this quarter, and so I guess what it comes down to is the normalization requirement for bankruptcy, is it really programming? And then, what are the implications for buying programming for the rest of the year, and what that means for your margins going forward, is really the implication

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [88]

No, there was no -- there's no need for normalization in the quarter in the results that we are presenting to you, for informational purposes. And from a programming point of view, that's pretty well done

 Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Group VP, Broadcasting, and President, Shaw Media   [89]

Well, there's no -- going forward -- it's Paul here. Going forward, there is no significant change in the comparison from a programming standpoint in TCAA and now. It's still going business

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [90]

And on the conventional side, how is the programming purchasing done? Is it done once a year, or is it done throughout the year? How is that done?

Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Group VP, Broadcasting, and President, Shaw Media   [91]

It's Paul here again. The programming purchasing is usually done in the springtime in terms of the overall arrangement. And they usually come in the form of varied output arrangements where you have a certain understanding of volumes and rates. And then those deals get played out throughout the year, and then they get renewed subsequently a year later

So, yes, it's kind of a one-time-a-year overarching deal, but with lots of activity throughout the year as schedules and programs change

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [92]

And with the ownership changes, not only with yourself, but the other ownership changes in the industry, should we be concerned about this spring purchasing of new programs?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [93]

Well, the spring programming purchases is always an important period in terms of setting the tone for the ratings expectation. But nothing changes. You go down and you make the best choices you can, and you be sensible about holding onto your wallet. And we're pretty comfortable that we can go through a sane period of competition there

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions). Vince Valentini from TD Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [2]

Two questions. First, particularly on the small medium business market you talked about, Brad, can you guys give us a sense of how you see profits and revenue evolving in that area? Is this a business where it you already have the infrastructure, so as soon as you start wrapping up customers, they are immediately accretive to your EBITDA and your margins? Or is there somewhat of a long investment cycle here we have to spend upfront and you could lose a little money in the next couple of quarters as you wrap up before you reach pay dirt?
  I will let you answer that first one and then come back for my second one

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CEO   [3]

This may be something, Vince, on that. We -- just to let you know, we went through a full strategic session with our Board yesterday, which, for myself, became very prevalent that we are certainly on the right track with where we are. The Board is very pleased. We are excited with how we are as a company and the position we're in

Part of that was looking at the business and the opportunity there. And I can tell you for a fact that, when we look at the businesses in our fiber, our plant and we overlaid it, a good majority of the business is within 200 feet of the plant we have and so we are comfortable we can have -- there is a good potential market share for us there, a good opportunity for us and as you know with high margins and a little competition, the doors opened for us

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [4]

Fair enough. The second question is on the cable side

Obviously you've had an increasing amount of pressure on your ARPU and margins, with each of the past couple of quarters. I'm wondering if we can ask about the promotions last year. You started those early last year and I am talking about the [10] promotion, obviously, and then you stopped it around August

Do you guys have a good sense of how much uptick there was from customers as the year went on? I'm wondering if maybe as you went from Q2 to Q3 to Q4 last year, did you see an escalating amount of people take those promotions as word-of-mouth spread and awareness spread? So that the magnitude of the impact in your numbers is growing with each passing quarter, but all of a sudden it will come to a stop once those promotions roll off?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP-Ops   [5]

Hey, Vince, it's Jay

Yes, we have extreme visibility into our promotional activity and obviously manage on a daily basis. I think there's really two primary buckets. There's been an awful lot of talk about the acquisition discounts and the various things that our competitor and us did when we were being very aggressive through the spring last year. Those, we started stepping up in acquisition offers in June. And as I am sure you can appreciate, you can't just turn the tap off

So we really stepped up through September, moving from 12 months to six, and moving from 10 to 20 to 30 and so forth. So the acquisition offers really stopped in any major way in October

What's maybe not fully appreciated is, of course, there was also save offers in the marketplace as all parts of the competitive environment do. And the save offers were probably a slightly larger number. And those really peeled off after the acquisition offers

So they -- we started to step up over the summer and kind of pulled them from the marketplace in October. So the good news for us as we look at the next couple of months is, certainly, every day our net promotional discounts is dropping with every day of business today. And as we look throughout the spring and even throughout the summer there is a real positive trend there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [6]

Okay, thanks

Operator   [7]

Jeff Fan from Scotia Capital

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [8]

Thanks very much. I want to go back and talk a little bit about the competitive environment through the quarter. You guys have put through some price increases, I believe, in the fall. However, TELUS hadn't done anything until really earlier this year. So can you guys talk a little bit about how that perhaps impacted your subscriber adds this particular quarter?
  And then I guess a little bit more comment on, since Q2, both yourselves and TELUS us have put through those price increases, now effective April. I'm just wondering whether you are seeing the competitive environment actually improve and whether that is translating into your numbers as well? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP-Ops   [9]

Thanks, Jeff. It is Jay again. Yes. So for contacts, we did a rate increase in September and I think with the cumulative nature of the promotional discounts that we were facing at that time, nobody was coming off promotions. Customers continued to go on and of course you have the multi-month impact of six and 12 month offers

So the rate increase in September really immediately got eaten up in terms of revenue balance. Both us and TELUS have done rate increases for April 1. We were [2 and 2 -- 2 on basic, on TV, they were 3 and 2]. And because we are in a much better position concerning our Company promotionally, we will be seeing that rate increase flow directly through our financials going forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CEO   [10]

You know, I think, Jeff, it is fair to say we've been disciplined in our promos and we will continue that. I think when you look at the second quarter, we have still seen aggressive promotions from the competitor. I can tell you recently we have seen that come up in maybe the term of the offer and also a little bit on the pricing

But it's still very intense, but we are starting to see a little bit of change

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [11]

Okay, and just one quick follow-up on the wireless. You didn't mention in your release regarding the CAD150 million to CAD200 million CapEx spending for wireless for this year. Can you perhaps update us on that?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CEO   [12]

As we indicated in the release, we are looking at technology and other options. And once we get through that review we will be looking at what our build activity is for the year. Looking at LTE naturally with the ecosystem there, development where you push back if that was your choice, your [build], and so we don't have anything specific right now in terms of giving you a new number, but we will come back on that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [13]

Okay. Thanks

Glen Campbell from Merrill Lynch

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [15]

Yes, thanks very much. First on the cable operating trends. You gave us a bit of color on the way the promotional discounts are rolling over. Could you talk a little bit about how your new rate plan structure is affecting the level of acquisition and save discounting that you are experiencing and when we might see any benefits coming from that? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP-Ops   [16]

Sure. Absolutely. We are not doing any save discounting, so that's straightforward one of the great things about Shaw Plan Personalizer is it's transparent, it's simple, it's flexible and for everybody. And so that is to the benefit of our long-term customers which we certainly heard loud and clear

And so if a customer is concerned about their pricing and packaging at Shaw, we have a whole new choice for them and an opportunity for them to reprice at full price and adjust their level of service

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CEO   [17]

Yes, and I guess on that, Glen, is that at a [really lousy customer cut them] and out of promotion on the Personalizer to be able to find what products and services at what level they want, so it's really flexible in that regard and we are comfortable that's a nice transition as we come out of promotion

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [18]

Okay. And on the subscriber trends, can you give us a sense what they were like in the quarter and maybe post-quarter? Have you seen them steady, improving, deteriorating through the quarter?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CEO   [19]

In this current quarter, you mean --?

Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [20]

Yes. Q2 and then into Q3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP-Ops   [21]

Well, it's -- we're -- I think we are still seeing -- you know, we have, you know, growth is certainly seeing that. You know, I think there's -- you know, we are still seeing some fallover from the second quarter in that regard. But you know, the promotional pricing is coming up. We are comfortable we have some nice growth opportunities in the quarter and the key for us is, you know, as you go along here there comes an inflection point where you are going to be pushed into the corner. And our focus and our commitment is to not do that, but over time, if promotion is the game you are going to have to play it, but we are focused on adding value in other ways. And the Personalizer gives you everyday value and we really believe this is a way going forward for Shaw and our customer base and how it gets them in there. But it's a balanced approach as we go forward to ensure that we can continue to grow and find that balance

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [22]

Thanks. Just a last one on wireless. I know you've got a lot of options on the table, but let's say in the situation where you decided to really pull back, would there not be a launch based on the current build? Would you sort of mothball what you have and wait for next generation technology? Could we see a sort of dramatic cutback in spending?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CEO   [23]

Glen, that is certainly a possibility but I think we don't want to prejudge it. We need to go through the process of evaluating the current state of LTE. I think you've probably heard that LTE is evolving at a fairly good clip

It is not a simple decision. I mean, if we do make the decision to go LTE, it would likely use up the 20 MHz spectrum that we have. So you've kind of made your bed in terms of how you wanted to fly it. And in order for us to do that, we would have to be fairly comfortable that there is a good fall back option to either other frequency bends that are using LTE or other technologies. It is probably going to be HSPA

So, we need to kind of go through the exercise of deciding whether or not this is the right technology path for us. Bearing in mind that whatever we do in this space is going to be focused really on providing high end data services and data-centric type services that extend our broadband advantage

We are not trying to compete here at the low end of the voice scale with all of the other -- all the other new entrants

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [24]

Thanks very much

Operator   [25]

Jonathan Allen from RBC Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [26]

Thanks very much. First question on wireless, and from all of the discussion it seems to be really just a question of whether you do HSPA or LTE. Is that the limit to your strategic review that you're doing for it? When I say strategic review, I think of other things as well -- partnerships, maybe acquisitions. Are all of those also on the table?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CEO   [27]

I think -- it's -- we are looking at all options and it is a little pre -- we just came out of a strategy session yesterday with the Board. So it is a little early to be defining on what that is, but certainly there's some offices out there for us that we are going to discuss and see where we go

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [28]

Just want to follow up on your discussion about cable and balancing, not wanting to be pushed into a corner. It seems to me, though, that subscriber growth has slowed quite significantly in the last couple of quarters. And I'm starting to wonder if you are starting to feel a little backed into a corner and if so, you mentioned the gateway, the gateway device being launched in May and from the sounds of it, the better user interface, whole home PVR capability. I think you also mentioned IT streaming in there as well, to

I mean, to me, that sounds like a pretty good competitive advantage or something you could fight back with TELUS. Will you be aggressively pushing that? And is this a way that we should look at subscriber trends picking up again in the next few quarters?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - President   [29]

It's Peter Bissonnette, the gateway guy. We just finished a demonstration as a part of our strategic overview for our Board, and as you know the composition of our Board is made up of Canadians and Americans and they have seen, many of them have seen the CES shows, etc. and I think they were very, very delighted when they saw the performance of the gateway that we demonstrated to them. The look, the feel, the user interface, the capability for six televisions being controlled independently from room to room which, as we mentioned in the past, will leapfrog what is available in our competitors' homes are very, very exciting. They -- we still have positioned this as a more of a -- I will call it a higher-end [need] service, but we are making the gateway available through our Easy Own process that we have in place for our HD PVRs and our lower-cost -- and our HD boxes. So we think that when customers see these in -- available for them on the first week of May that they are going to be really delighted with it

Now, last time we talked about the gateway, we couldn't tell you who's made it. And that but today we are delighted to let you know that this is a manufacturer that has made for us many, many hundreds and hundreds of thousands of modems for our telephone product, [Eris]. And of course, the Moxi box is a very, very high-end box. And so the look and feel, the Internet guide, the IP interfaces, the DLNA, which will become available in -- I think it's in July is a part of this, the versions that we'll be ultimately moving to, will make this a very, very compelling box

And so it's just one of the things that we are looking at in terms of adjusting, if you will, of competitive advantages. And you know, we're -- I think we're trying to maintain a disciplined approach to pricing and a value add -- and this is a great part of that value add and proposition

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [30]

I know I've taken up a lot of time. If I can just ask a summary question of back? So, with the subscriber trends that we saw this quarter, coming down significantly year over year, is this basically now a new normal for you? Or with all of the competitive changes and things that you talked about earlier, should we start to see some recovery?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - President   [31]

Well, obviously, our objectives of this are to turn this around in terms of trending, etc., and the Gateway box is just one of the tools that we have. We have a very compelling Internet product. I think you know as Jay had said in our Personalizer Plan that the foundation Internet product is a very, very robust one. We believe that -- it's the Internet services that we have will start to become the driving force in our product mix and we haven't even turned up the dial on that yet

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP-Ops   [32]

Yes, I think if you got [smear] in Internet, you know and phone, we got pricing collar when you look at east to west and opportunities there. And you know but it is not growth at any cost. And it's good growth. It's growth that contributes and you know it is not a raise to the bottom

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CFO   [33]

And let me just add to that from a financial point of view. If you look at total cable ARPU for the first two quarters of this year, we are running at around [CAD106 versus CAD102] average last year. On Internet, we are over [CAD42 compared to under CAD41] last year. And that is before the rate increase that we just put through now. So there's a cable one as well. And digital is maintaining well typically flat

So ARPU is still growing good. It still has pricing power in the product. And we have an enormous base of that, that takes into account

One of the things I think out there that people are concerned about is you know the guidance for the year. We said that there would be a moderate, for a core cable of satellites that there would be growth, but that was moderately less than 7.5%. And what I can say is that in order to achieve that, we have the rate increase now, which we put in place in April, and Jay talked about that. Even allowing with some -- for some promotional activity there, that is going to add CAD35 million of EBITDA in the second half of the year

And then secondly, of course, we have had the restructuring initiatives, which are somewhat [fees]. But they will add CAD20 million in the second half of the year. So there's CAD55 million of EBITDA growth coming just from those two things

So when you look at this how much not just from a subscriber point of view, you have to look at EBITDA. You have to look at the cost initiatives that we've undertaken, the pricing power that is still in the product. And you know what I can say is that of 12 analysts here, when you look at their core cable and satellite estimate for growth for the year, there are 5 -- the group of you are at 5.5% which is in line with what we said which was moderately less than 7.5%

And when Greg asked the question we said that would be 1 or 2 points less. So I think where you are thinking in terms of the second half of the year from a financial point of view, once you take all those things into account, is pretty well on track

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jonathan Allen,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [34]

Okay. That's a great answer. Thank you very much

Bob Bek from CIBC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC - Analyst   [36]

Good afternoon. I have got a couple of media questions, I guess, for Paul. Obviously strong add growth in the quarter. Can you give us any color at all on the conventional specialty split? And I know visibility is always hard in this space, but any of your thoughts on the market and the continuing improvement or recovery on the conventional side? I have got a couple of follow-ups as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul Robinson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - President-Shaw Media   [37]

Sure, Bob, it's Paul here. We are pleased that the growth was supported by both conventional and specialty, and both are growing really well. So that, in terms of the market overall, clearly, we are still in total greenlight mode. So the recovery is totally intact all of the key categories, that we consider that are kind of bread-and-butter. You know, the big ones like food and automobile and retail are all showing good core strength. So we see no signs of the add markets easing up. And we are really well positioned within that because of our programming strength and our renewed vigor

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC - Analyst   [38]

Can you talk a bit about the programming strength release to the requirement for investment? On the conventional side, at least CCTV has got a bit of a lock on the ratings. You inherited that

Should we expect to see a fairly material effort to try to break into that ratings pack a bit? Or is it something we would see take place over a longer period?

Paul Robinson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - President-Shaw Media   [39]

Well, you really have to look at the ratings on a by market basis in terms of kind of how you're doing in terms of the top 20 programming and you know we've -- Canwest had improved their position a lot over the last two, three years on that basis. So we now get [five date] at the top 20 in those key markets

So we're really quite well positioned compared to historic. And so you know, everyone is always looking for an opportunity to improve their position. That is what it's all about. But as I heard Pat say earlier, not at any cost. Right. So we are going to be prudent

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC - Analyst   [40]

Thank you. And perhaps for Steve. Just the CapEx, I know it is not a very capital-intensive business, but just to get a better sense on the media cash flow, free cash flow, what kind of CapEx outlook do we see for this? Or -- I know you don't break out individually, but just any ballpark you could give would be great. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CFO   [41]

No, Bob, that's a good question because you are running at CAD64 million of free cash flow as reported. Actually better than that, but the [two months] of the equity pickup in the last two quarters, we will see, the first two quarters were fairly light in terms of both CapEx and benefit obligation spending. So in the last two quarters, we will see that pickup and we expect capital to be about in the CAD20 million range in the last two quarters and the benefit spend about CAD20 million as well. So that's a substantial pickup from the first half of the year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC - Analyst   [42]

That's helpful. Thanks very much

Tim Casey from BMO Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [44]

Thanks. Brad, can -- when you're going through your strategic review, should we assume that you're -- on wireless, should we assume that you are still committed to a facilities-based offer? Because in the past you've talked about how wholesale agreements just aren't economic to you and you prefer to control all aspects of your operations. So are you still committed to facilities-based offer?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CEO   [45]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [46]

Has anything changed with respect to your thoughts on any wholesale agreements as an interim phase or anything like that?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CEO   [47]

You know, just coming out of a session yesterday, I think we are a little early. We have a little bit of follow-up the management team has to do here for the Board. I tell you we've talked about a variety of things and we will be able to give you a little more color to that in a couple of weeks here. So it's -- we are open

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [48]

Right. Is there any other assets that you are reviewing? Any of the media assets you own that you are going to look at whether or not you want to hold on to them longer term? I mean, there are some smaller ones in there that would seem to be maybe of interest to others and not strategic to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CEO   [49]

Well, we are pretty comfortable where we are right now. We've -- you know BBC Kids and One Mind Body is no longer in part of the portfolio, but we are comfortable we can renegotiate any of the deals we need to do to get us better economics in some of the lower end channels. We like the mix we have now

Paul has some plans to do a few other things, but no, we are comfortable where we are now. And there is really nothing in the hopper to look at any kind of --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [50]

Right. And lastly, it seems like an obvious one but, given the way you talk about wireless, we should also assume that you are still committed to participating in the 700 wireless spectrum auction?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP-Ops   [51]

I think we're going to wait and see what the option framework looks like before we make that call

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CEO   [52]

Yes. We have to really see what is the framework, what does the government have in there and we are just not totally sure what is going to come out of that and then we will base it on that

Rob Goff from Northland Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Northland Capital Markets - Analyst   [55]

Peter, you've used the expression before throttling up or throttling down and not to put words in your mouth, but would it be fair to say that you throttled down on the digital boxes ahead of the new box launch?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - President   [56]

Are you referring to Internet speed, or --?

Rob Goff,  Northland Capital Markets - Analyst   [57]

No, no, no, in terms of how hard you pushed on the product

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - President   [58]

I see what you mean now

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Northland Capital Markets - Analyst   [59]

Did you pull back on the digital boxes in anticipation of the launch?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - President   [60]

No. I would say that -- no, as [what do we mean when we talk about] falling down we were saying at that time that if we wanted -- we were 40% at the other time in penetration and some were saying the industry is significantly higher and we said yes, but the industry is being basically subsidizing that growth. We -- it was said that we don't need to do that. It is not as critical

What became critical, though, was some of the threshold, the 80% threshold became critical for us in terms of our ability then to have more flexibility in the way that we program and the way that we package our services. And so, to the extent that we introduced a -- basically a rental model, which was very, very attractive and which took advantage of the void that existed in our penetration, we have done very, very well

But that's still -- we haven't really tinkered with that as we go into the -- up on the realm of the gateway. We think that the gateway will appeal to a higher end customer. But when they get that gateway in the various [slave units], they are going to be the most satisfied customer because it is frankly the most rewarding experience that we've had in the cable industry in all the times that I have been around. It is a very, very compelling -- compelling experience

So, we think it will develop its own kind of ramp in terms of growth. And it will be based solely on a desire for the highest quality

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP-Ops   [61]

And Rob, building on what Peter said, sort of the inference behind your question appeared to be our digital growth numbers. And I think our plan is well on track towards our 80% digital penetration by the end of the fiscal year. And what you are more seeing is the natural evolution of our programs as we continue to move -- we've hit sort of the level that that program was designed to take us to. I think you'll see the next level of digital growth come with the migration of services from analog to digital. And that will evolve and take us to the next spot as per the digital plan

So there isn't really a shift in approach. It's just more of the natural inflection point as we hit our 80% number

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Northland Capital Markets - Analyst   [62]

For instance, and if I may, on the prospective impact of the rollover of the promotional packages, if you were to do a mark to market on the cable rates, would that be like a [1 million per month impact or a 2 million] per month impact? Just sort of a guidance on what that might be, if you could?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP-Ops   [63]

I don't know

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - President   [64]

There's so many moving pieces there that could be dangerous to do that. So I know you are trying to model that out, but I'm not sure that we could really help you with that one

 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities/Griffiths McBurney - Analyst   [73]

And the depreciation expense in the quarter, is that a good run rate to use?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CFO   [74]

Yes, I believe so

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities/Griffiths McBurney - Analyst   [75]

Okay, then on the follow-ups. On wireless, I'm just trying to get an understanding of what the tipping point was that led to delays. Is it cost? Is it how you intend to use the spectrum? I'm not really getting an understanding of that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CFO   [76]

In regards to the delay?

Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities/Griffiths McBurney - Analyst   [77]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CFO   [78]

Well, you know, I think, you know, Michael, why don't you start and I will finish it?

Michael D'Avella,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP-Planning   [79]

Well, I mean, look, the evolution of LTE is happening a lot faster than anybody anticipated. And when you see Verizon, probably the most aggressive in terms of deployments and the kind of cover pops that they are talking about in the US and the devices that they are actually causing to be built, look, it just caused us to simply step back and say, Do you really want to be the sixth HSPA network in the market that is heading in the wrong direction from a technology point of view?
  So we are making the prudent call here. And the prudent call is step back, watch LTE evolve. It is going to evolve over the next 24 months and you are probably going to see some pretty clear ecosystems evolving around whether you are in the AT&amp;T camp or the Verizon camp. So that drives a lot of decision here and we've only got --. We've 20 MHz of spectrum and you can only use it for one or the other and it would be foolish to split it up into HSPA and LTE

And if you are the new guy to market with a strategy to focus on data and bundling that product would all the wonderful broadband things that we do and the fact that our video services are going to be part of the mix as well, you've got to make the right technology call

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities/Griffiths McBurney - Analyst   [80]

And then the CapEx that you spent to date is not -- there is no waste in that CapEx. You will be able to utilize everything you spent on --?

Michael D'Avella,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP-Planning   [81]

Well, some of it is going to be redeployable if we head down that path. Yes, absolutely. I mean we -- when we made the vendor choice, we clearly had an LTE path in mind. We just didn't pin the time. But you know we are now in a position where we can make some of those calls

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP-Ops   [82]

And, Peter, no doubt a factor of -- you know, when you look at retention spending, what's going on currently right now, you know, $15 a month, those types of things are to us in like a little bit of a chase to the bottom as I had mentioned earlier. So you know, those are a factor also

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CEO   [83]

Yes, and just to add to that in terms of people that talk about wireless slowing. I mean, these are very important decisions from a technology point of view and also making sure that we look at whatever alternatives are out there

Let's remember that in the early days of -- in the early years of wireless it's not going to be a significant EBITDA contributor. So if you are a little bit off and you hit your timing right with the right technology or you have some other way of approaching the market, that is it would seem at this point very prudent approach to the press that -- look at the state of the market today. I mean there's nothing wrong with living things settle down here and seeing where they come out and then we will be ready to get into the market in a way that is appropriate for us

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities/Griffiths McBurney - Analyst   [84]

That makes a lot more sense. Thank you

The other question I have is on the basic subscriber losses. When you look at the experiences that you had in Manitoba, when you compare to where TELUS's rollout is today, where are we in that erosion? Are we early on? Should we expect the subscriber losses, pending whether or not the gateway is a big impact or not, should we expect the subscriber losses to accelerate and stay where they are for a couple of years?
  Just trying to get a feeling of that, of where we are in that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP-Ops   [85]

Yes. We are in our sixth year of competition with TELUS TV. They've changed platforms and certainly have gone very aggressively at their most recent platform. So they would have probably 300 -- I guess they wouldn't have released their quarter yet. Mid-300s customers at this point

So I think we are at a point where both sides are maturing and, presumably, TELUS would be doing the natural thing with 300 some odd thousand customers and trying to figure out a way to make money off that base at this point. And so, I think that is what we experienced in the other marketplace is when you are a brand-new entrant, you don't necessarily need to get a return on your investment

And so we are seeing positive signs in that regard and we have got lots of levers in the competitive environment here. You know with the gateway is certainly one, but probably even more significantly is broadband leadership and the opportunity for us to really drive our Internet business and certainly the business market as material for us and the -- in that case, the telcos are really in a near monopoly position with 90% kind of shares involved

So there's good opportunities on that side of the business. So we think we are in a very balanced competitive environment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CEO   [86]

Yes and just to add to that, as Jay said, there are still great growth opportunities. We talked about pricing power and what we've done in the business, but -- . And this is not to say that we don't take subscriber losses seriously or that we are complacent about it by any means. But I think everybody has to keep in perspective here that we've lost 20,000 basic subs in this year on a total base of 2.2 million customers

So we are balancing all of those things and we are also focusing on the core business to make sure that we've got the weapons to be able to provide our customers with what they need and what we need to be able to grow value in the

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP-Ops   [87]

And you know, the IP TV footprint is significant for TELUS. So it is covering the majority of the market

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maher Yaghi from Desjardins Securities

 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [90]

Thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to talk a little bit about your new box strategy. Talking maybe about the cost associated with upgrading your customer base with these new boxes, when I look at TELUS, they have a happy partner in Microsoft willing to subsidize the Xboxes for free basically, offering them to customers. When you look at your subscriber base and what it takes for you to offer these Moxi boxes you -- can you maybe talk to us about how you can --? What is your contemplated cost associated with upgrading your subscriber base with these new boxes so that you can continue to be competitive in a market where more and more customers are looking for multi-HD receivers in every room?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CEO   [91]

Well, just to start off with I will let David --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CEO   [92]

The multi-HD receiver, if that is the quest, then they will go to the best. I hate to say that in a cocky way, but when you have six home -- six rooms in the home and they all have HD -- different sources of HD and they can control all of the HD, the quality of the HD will be as high as it is available anywhere in the industry, then they will look to this. So we believe we believe that the quality hunters will, rest on it, will come to our gateway. Because that is significantly better than what is out there right now

Then, in terms of the deployment, Jay can talk about that. Because it's not something that's going to be broadly deployed initially. It is going to grow as our HD boxes and our HD PVRs grew and it was in a very, very low subsidized kind of approach. The customers will see the value in it. They have options to buy it or to rent it. Jay?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP-Ops   [93]

Yes, absolutely. This is a high-end solution. I think if you are trying to sort of evaluate sides in terms of the battle for the big screen, which is really what we're talking about here, you know for sure, we have spent the last couple of years investing very heavily in our HD pictures and there is no question that we are in a leadership position in terms of picture quality that is offered to the big screen. Absolutely no question. We invested heavily in transforming our on demand product

And those were the 2 major plays that we have made over the course of the past couple of years. And I don't think they were wrong. At the same time the IP TV players and all of our markets went with Microsoft Media Room which gives them a more Internet feeling guide and Whole Home PVR solution. And I don't think they were wrong either. And by the way, if you look at the technologies that were available to each of us as we were making those decisions a couple of years ago, we probably both made the rational decisions based on what was available to us

If you fast forward to today, our new Gateway solution provides a very compelling Internet feeling guide and as a step forward in terms of the guide and a very, very compelling six tuner whole phone PVR solution. But remember that all of our platforms have a roadmap. So our true two-way guide is available for VOD applications today. It will be fully available in the fall for our existing boxes and, actually, I think our true two-way guide is even a step forward from what we have on the (technical difficulties) box today and certainly a step forward in terms of Microsoft Media Room. And it of course is backward compatible to much of our base. And there's Whole Home PVR solutions coming for the base as well as we evolve in platforms

So we have got a roadmap for all of our pieces and so there certainly isn't a need to do a major conversion here. And there is no question if you look at the biggest screens in Western Canada, we are in a leadership position even today without those things. We will absolutely be in a leadership position as we move forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [94]

So basically you think your customers value -- would value your product for CAD400, CAD500 more than what they are getting with the competitive product? They are willing to pay that price to get that quality? That is basically your bet right now

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP-Ops   [95]

Well they have been all along with HD PVR. They have been paying for those HD PVRs in spite of the fact that they could have got something -- an alternative service. The quality of the pictures is what was driving that desire. And there is clearly a difference in the quality of the pictures

Dvai Ghose from Canaccord Genuity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [98]

Thank you very much. If I can go back to the HSPA versus LTE question. If you decide to go all LTE, and I would completely accept the fact that it is going to have tremendous carrier support and global economies of scale over time, but at the moment, there is very limited device availability

As you know, Verizon and AT&amp;T have clearly only put data on their LTE channels at the moment. They are underlined voice network is still HSPA or CDMA. And at least one of the incumbents disputes the fact that if you go LTE-only that they have to provide you with HSPA roaming as part of the mandated roaming rules. So given all those complications, when do you think you could actually build out a ubiquitous LTE offering?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CEO   [99]

You have just described why we are doing what we're doing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [100]

Fair enough. So if you delay, and let's say you especially delayed beyond 2012, which may be the case. I guess your comments are that there is no major urgency. What I would contend is obviously penetration rises every day, increasingly data-centric customers want iPads and other wireless devices to complement their desktop broadband experiences

You run out of mandated roaming as part of the mandate from the AWS auction in 2014 which is not that far away now. And in the interim, you talk about TELUS's aggression, they're gushing cash flow from the wireless business which they're clearly using against you in the broadband business and TV business without your ability to impact them on the wireless business. Are these important factors in terms of accelerating the rollout?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP-Ops   [101]

I could only speak to the impact on the core business if you would like

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [102]

Please

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP-Ops   [103]

I think it's -- let's be absolutely clear. We have -- we need some dramatic moves in terms of creating a rational pricing in the marketplace and we continue to remain hopeful that our competitor will follow us. And I think that is what you're seeing in terms of what is happening in terms of our subscriber numbers

In terms of the competitive balance, the concept that we would be able to launch a wireless network that could fundamentally shift bundling as the sixth player in the marketplace and change the core economics is one that is a little hard for us to see. We are going to win the battle for our core business within our core business. We are going to win it through a broadband leadership strategy and being the leading Internet provider in our market

And certainly we just recently went through some usage billing consultations throughout our country in 34 different markets sitting and meeting with our customers. And while they weren't all delighted with some of the things that we've done around the Internet, I can tell you that there wasn't any of them that were willing to consider leaving us in terms of going to a telco competitor for the Internet

That is absolutely our core competitive advantage. We are going to make it stronger and that will be what tips the scales back

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CEO   [104]

And just again, not to drive this down to wireless, but -- so keep looking at the bigger picture here. We've just come out of a very energizing discussion with our Board and our overall strategy is very much in alignment on where we're going here. And it is a big picture view of all of the businesses that we have and how we create shareholder value from it

And we have got tremendous opportunities in the core to technological opportunities to be able to compete very effectively and to develop and further that competition. We have talked about wireless, we've talked about the fact that we are looking at the technology and that that will change the timeframe if we do them. We are also looking at other options as well

You know, wireless is not necessarily on your band of business, certainly not in the short term. And so even if we are a little bit late here, you know, we see a focus on the core as being important and then the last thing, the media, and you will disagree with me on this, but the media investment has turned out to be great for us. There's tremendous synergies that we are just starting to begin to realize

So we are very much in alignment. And we are very confident about the strategy we have going forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP-Ops   [105]

And I really think that the next two years, the fight is still for the home. And that is where you are going to see our focus, along with other things

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [106]

That makes sense. If I can just ask one more question on a different topic, which is a threat from over-the-top video. I guess in Canada, the arguments against the threat for over-the-top video have traditionally been, number one, we charge usage-based billing for Internet services which is not generally the case in the United States, for example. And number two, digital rights management where we have a lot of Canadian companies which own a lot of rights to content

But I guess both those issues have seemed to be somewhat challenged this year. On the usage-based billing, of course, there's been a huge political furor over the wholesale issue which seems to have seeped onto the retail side as well. And when it comes to content, obviously you are aware of the Netflix-Paramount deal recently. To what extent is this a growing threat in your mind, given these factors?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CEO   [107]

Well, let me deal with the content issue. You might want to comment on the usage-based billings, Peter

So on the content side, I mean what their -- they are obviously being more aggressive in terms of acquiring programming. They have done the Paramount deal which is essentially the pay-TV window for that particular content

That content is available to us. Not necessarily in that window, but it is available in an earlier window. So whatever movies they have, we will get through VOD, and even an extension of VOD, we can actually get the broadband right. So they don't really have any sort of a content advantage from the perspective of being able to get that particular content

The high-quality content, which is called the premium content that is sort of available from pay-TV offerings that either Movie Central or the Movie Network provides and typically that is HBO and Showtime and a few others, that's not available to them. That is essentially part of that particular pay-TV bundle and pay-TV window

So we still have access to the premium content. The premium content to us is available on a variety of platforms, whether it is on demand or broadband and eventually on a mobile platform if we want it

So they are not going to get that. I mean, the Canadian market in my view and our view is a relatively better organized market in terms of actually acquiring these rights. And Paul can certainly comment on what we do on the TV side of the business, but we have a pretty good pipeline of content acquisition of both the television side of the business as well as the specialty side of the business

And remember, those services provide a tremendous amount of content, you know, obviously, in a scheduled and linear format, but we do have the ability to take as much of that as possible where we have the rights and provide it on demand, provide it on broadband and provide it on the devices. So our customers have access to whatever they want from the perspective of either movie content or other types of content that we license either directly or through a variety of programming services

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul Robinson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - President-Shaw Media   [108]

And we are of the mind that we still have a tremendous upside in terms of pricing power on our Internet services. And through the course of our consultations with our customers, I think what we've seen from them is the recognition that the principle of if you use more you should pay more holds true. But we believe that as we've worked our way through some of the feedback that we've received from them, that there really is a win-win for our shareholders as well as our customers in the way that we offer our tiers of Internet services

Remember in the western part of Canada, both the telephone competitor and ourselves, we do not -- haven't charged a customer yet for usage space. Whereas in the East, both the telephone and the cable operator have been doing that for some time and their pricing is higher than ours and we believe that we still have that pricing power, and that we can be very creative in the way that all for our services

What Jay said was that not one of the customers who came to those consultations was saying to us that if you don't -- if you do something, we are going to leave to go to a lesser performing Internet service. They all acknowledge that our Internet service provides them with the kind of experience that they want and that this was really just a value and a price situation for them with respect to a threshold, [over in a] threshold and a desire to know what they are paying on a monthly basis

And we think that we can address that through the manner in which we tier -- offer our tiers of Internet services

Blair Abernathy from Stifel Nicolaus

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Blair Abernathy,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst   [111]

Thank you. Just wanted to follow up a little bit more on the Internet, if I could. The usage-based billing testing you've been doing. You have really given us a sense of when do you think you might actually begin to shift the pricing over to usage-based billing, first off?
  And secondly, given the tiers you have now and the product at high end up 100 MIPS do you see those -- has your feedback and of giving you a sense of that maybe there's more tiers required and I guess also with the gateway product coming does that maybe push the higher -- push it to move the higher end up?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP-Ops   [112]

Yes that was one of the conclusions we came to was that the thresholds, because we don't use that other word anymore, the thresholds that were in place could probably be more generous, and which is part of a win-win kind of solution. Our customers question the thresholds and the levels based on the kind of usage that they are experiencing. And interestingly enough, the Netflix usage actually on our network has gone down since they introduce that -- I'll call it the low grade movie viewing experience, which was intended to maybe not have customers hitting those thresholds as quickly as they would on a higher grade viewing experience. And so, there are some impacts that have already been felt as a result of this. And I think one of them is we have a much, much better sense of what is important to our customers. And our customers said, We are prepared to pay more for higher value services

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Blair Abernathy,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst   [113]

Okay, great. Again, any sense of -- is this going to happen this year do you think or is it next year?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CEO   [114]

We are certainly going to clarify our pricing and packaging plans probably in the late spring. Probably May, early June. The process of course is we did 34 sessions across the country in community halls and libraries and those concluded on 1 April. We've got some further follow-up that we committed to do with the customers who came out to our sessions, who really went -- came out and spent a couple of hours with us for a sandwich and a Diet Coke and have really helped us build our Internet product of the future

And absolutely, people have said to us, Let's not divide the Internet product today. Let's figure out how to create a world-class Internet experience and then we can figure out how to do pricing and packaging from there

So I would think it would be reasonable to get further clarity as we are going to go back and talk to some more customers about it. So you'll probably read about it on social media like you seem to be reading about all this stuff, which is great. And we will probably have more formal announcements, kind of end of May, early June

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Blair Abernathy,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst   [115]

That's good. That's very helpful. Thanks. And just one quick one for Steve. Steve, the tax rate this quarter is just below 25%. What is your expectation for the year on the tax rate?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CFO   [116]

So, for the year, the tax rate will be between 28% and 30%

Operator   [119]

Tim Casey, a follow-up question

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [120]

Thanks. Can you provide any goalposts or metrics for us on your expectations for this [new] business? Can you -- any sign -- any clarity you can provide on how many dedicated salespeople you have there now? Anything you could put around that?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CEO   [121]

Well, as a part of our reorg, Tim, we actually were able to move the sales forces out to all of our regions and we have also empowered those sales forces to be selling the full range of the products that Jay describe which is the add over DOCSIS and PRIs. Some other hosted products. And so we will have in each of our regions, salesmen in those markets who will be making those sales promotional activities for us. So we are actually quite excited because what we see is actually a material increase over the next few years in the kind of sales that we are going to come -- will come from that segment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP-Ops   [122]

But Brad has been very clear in terms of his expectations. So this business today is a couple hundred million dollars a year for us in terms of revenue. Our business model was exponential growth over the three years. So you can do the math on two or three times that and a margin significantly north of 50%. So it's not our whole growth story, but it is a big part of our growth story

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [123]

And would you -- would there be specific dedicated CapEx associated with reaching those goals? Or is that -- once again, is that something that you think you can do with what you have now?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CEO   [124]

Yes, I don't think you'll see a material change in our core CapEx run. If you sort of model in and around 20%, maybe lower the NAT in year three, year four capital intensity, you get a sense of what's there. But remember we are spending some capital in that business today and because we haven't broken it out, we don't necessarily see it in your run rate

So I don't think you are going to see any major shifts

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP-Ops   [125]

A lot of our fiber segmentation, [bolt] segmentation, much -- many of these products can actually be delivered over a traditional hybrid fiber coax which actually exists. So we are levering, leveraging our core assets to make these products available now

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions). Vince Valentini from TD Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [2]

Yes, thanks very much. Two questions. One on cable and one on media. On the cable side, I'm wondering even though it's early days, if you can give us some sense of what the consumer response has been to the new internet packages and to the Arris boxes, I don't know if you have some numbers you can share or just anecdotally how those are gaining traction

I'll throw the media one at you too so you can think about it. It seems like there's extreme seasonality in this business. I think there's barely any EBITDA in Q4 last year. I'm just wondering if you see similar pattern this year, that there should be a big drop off from the EBITDA you just did in Q3 to Q4, and carrying that into 2012, is there anything unusual about this high level of profitability this year, that you could point to that would make it difficult to have another year of growth off this base in 2012, or do you think this is just sort of normal and as long as the advertising markets hold up that there should be some sort of growth in 2012 off of these good numbers? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [3]

Well Vince, I'll start on the cable and maybe Jay will chime in, but you're right. We're on the early stages here, as we've launched these new products. I can give you an example on the internet. We, with the speeds we had launched before and the pricing, we have approximately about 1,500 high speed customers on our high speed service and I think the second day of launch we matched that, so there's certainly a big appetite for the speeds. There's a natural progression as we move the internet base totally up into the new levels of service, so we're certainly excited about it, but it is early stages and Jay, maybe you want to talk a little bit about the Gateway

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP - Operations   [4]

For sure. The Gateway we launched in Calgary in early May and we launched in Edmonton last week. We are, Gateway is proceeding extremely well. We're moving to launch in the markets this Summer and in fact recently moved our launch dates forward between 2 and 3 weeks in each market, in order to make sure that we're in position to really capitalize this and in large volume in the Fall so we're excited by Gateway. We've had a good technical launch, and we've had a great customer response, and similar to Brad's comments on the internet side, we've really hit a sweet spot here, the 50 meg service is our main internet service, is resonating with customers, and we're migrating our customers upward very quickly

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [5]

Just on that, Vince, I think you can also look at if you look at the Personalizer and how that, bundle how that Extreme is driving that and it's just another way for choice and value in the customers and having the internet in that stream and being able to add the video and basic phone on that side has really created a lot more choice and that's allowing people to pick and choose the services and products they want and so we're very comfortable where we are at but it is early stages

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [6]

Great and on the media?

Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc - President - Shaw Media   [7]

Great. On the media. It's Paul Robertson here. On the media side, the first question related to the symmetry of the quarters, and it's true, the fourth quarter always tends to be our weakest quarter, so the kind of performance we saw last year and what our expectations this year is kind of more in that breakeven range. It can vary up and down somewhat but it tends to be within a band generally, given the nature of the fourth quarter sales being down compared to the other 3

With respect to the second part of the question that talked about whether there was something unusual that generated the strong level of EBITDA and revenue in the 3 quarters to date, no, it was good blocking and tackling. We're enjoying our good bounce back to the market and I think we performed a little better than the market on the revenue side, good cost control and we just got to keep up that kind of level of performance and we'll continue to put in these kind of numbers

I want to ask about the ARPU trends, because one of the things that, based on the average revenue per RGU that we saw in this quarter, it seems like a pretty big reversal from what's been a decline in the last few quarters through growth, and also, I think on an absolute dollar of revenue per unit, it seems like it's as high as its been in quarters, so just wondering what some of the drivers are. I'm sure that it's a lot of the factors that Brad, you touched on, but are there anything that's significant that stands out and I guess the sustainability of this going forward as well, I'm wondering if you can just touch on that. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, CFO   [10]

Well let me just start by kind of giving all of our listeners some data points here. So in the third quarter, the total ARPU in the third quarter was CAD110 million, and year-to-date its been CAD107 million and that compares to CAD102 million last year, so a significant increase this quarter from that CAD102 million average to CAD110 million as we've seen now and same thing with internet this quarter we're about CAD44 whereas last year we were under CAD42 and on digital, things have leveled off in that CAD19 to CAD20 range and again, on satellite as well this quarter, we're at CAD71 versus an average of CAD68 last year, so I think part of it is through the rate increase and I'll just turn it over to Jay to give you more details on ARPU

One of the things on internet as well I think that's very important to understand is that while we grew 11,000 subs in internet, I think one of the major factors that's happening here is that we've got a lot of migration up, migration that's going up into the Extreme package which we've just increased the speeds on, and increased up from certainly from light and up into high speeds through the entire band, so I think it's important that people not just look at the total lives of internet but also look at the internet, the ARPU and how that's driving growth in revenue

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP - Operations   [11]

Jeff, it's Jay here. Just if I can amplify some of the things Steve just said. For sure, this is fundamentally a subscription revenue business, and subscribers are one way to predict subscription revenue. Obviously ARPU is perhaps even more significant, in terms of as you look in the next 12 months. We've got the 3 main drivers which you've seen, which is rate adjustments that are positively impacting our situation and also are being responded to competitively so we think we're in a pretty good environment that way

We've talked a lot in previous quarters about promotional discounts, and the opportunity that really begins in Q3 that flows through next year, and you're certainly starting to see us realize the things that we've talked about the last couple of quarters and Steve's really got the golden goose in terms of our ARPU for the next 12 months, which is our broadband leadership in internet service. We still have most of our customers on a 7.5 meg internet service, and our core internet service is 6 times as fast as that, and so there will be a nice revenue uptake over the next 12 months as we move our existing customers up into the broadband leadership package

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [12]

What about the business segment, without going into too much specifics, for maybe competitive reasons but I'm just curious, like how much of a lift are you seeing from business in terms of ARPU on the relative basis on what they're coming in at?

Bradley Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [13]

Well, Jeff, I'll say a couple things. I think one is we talked about this for a couple quarters. We've certainly seen the opportunity, I think it's important the product mix is right when you look at the market and where we're going, I think you're seeing us commit a substantial amount of capital as we go forward from all the initiatives we do, which certainly tie into the business and business parks and those opportunities but really key for us is the service over the co-ax cable which certainly allows us to expand and have access to so many of the customers with co-ax versus a fiber-based solution so we're on the cusp of really gaining more momentum. As for the ARPU question, I with have to pass that over to the CFO or Peter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, CFO   [14]

Well I would say that in general terms, while we don't break it out, our revenue year over year on a year-to-date basis is up about 20% and we expect double digit growth in that range or higher for next year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [15]

And can I say something also about the environment. It was a quarter ago, when we were talking about we were going to be focusing on our core business and we were going to become the broadband leaders in this industry because there was a perception somehow that tell us if it's IPTV service that somehow it was starting to become the preferred network, and I think one of the things that really excited us when we were in Chicago and as we embraced the Arris platform, that we've now moved, IP is not about picture quality

IP is about flexibility, and it's about the guide and so to the extent the Arris box provides us with that, in tandem with probably the highest quality MPEG 4 HD signals in North America, the reception now is shifting and it's shifting to the core business, it's shifting to our capabilities to deliver unbelievable speeds that even telcos can't differentiate on those speeds, and so we're probably the most positive that I've seen in this industry in 30 years with the things that we're looking at going forward, continuing to expand the internet, the speed of the internet, the quality of our services, the upgrade that Jay mentioned and Brad mentioned, the impact on the service and reliability of the network by taking out the traps is going to give us a huge advantage in terms of quality, reliability and speed

Glen Campbell from Banc of America-Merrill Lynch

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [18]

Yes, thanks very much. Clearly a nice quarter financially. As you look forward, I think you're painting a very bright picture in terms of the potential to grow ARPU in the future. Would you say then that the view is that subscriber growth is going to be sort of steady as she goes across the 3 services, and we should look to grow them in terms of cash flow and ARPU, or do you see the potential to accelerate the rate of subscriber growth in the core business as well?

Bradley Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [19]

This is Brad here, and I'll just say a couple things. I think you're seeing leveling off of the activity now. There's no doubt the competitiveness is intense and we continue to see that and we expect it going forward. We still think there's pricing power in the market when you look at it. We certainly have the migration opportunity from internet as we move that whole base up, and we're going to continue to be in a leadership role as we look at new products and services and how to best serve our customers

There's no doubt that I agree with Peter that we certainly turned the ship around from an industry point of view and even from a Shaw point of view of the 2 quarters ago, and business is opportunity, so we're comfortable with those pieces that we're going to have some good opportunity in 2012 and going forward. The growth of the days before are not going to be the same as we know it and competition does that but certainly, we prove the opportunity where we can grow EBITDA and certainly grow cash flow and have opportunities going forward. I don't know if Jay or Steve you want to add anything there?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, CFO   [20]

Yes, I would just add to it that I think the focus, even absent the subscriber sort of position, I think what we've done with reducing promotional activity and the Shaw Plan Personalizer is a very successful way to be able to do that and to be able to provide our customers with value. There's certainly still pricing power in all of the products and we have seen pricing increases from the competitor in recent months so that's an important factor. There is the growth of the business segment and then there's growth in ARPU just through value as what we're talking about here in the internet and also as we improve our customer premise equipment offering, so even on a relatively steady state, subscriber kind of view, there is certainly lots of opportunities for growth

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [21]

Just perhaps to follow-up on that, you've painted an intriguing picture about the potential to lift ARPU on data with your new offering. Could you give us a sense when people are choosing say Shaw Internet from scratch? Are most of them taking the 50 meg internet service since its been offered?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP - Operations   [22]

Yes, I would say, I'm doing the calculation in my head, Glenn. I would say most is a little bit strong. I think it would be fair to say that most are above high speed now in terms of selecting either Extreme or 50 meg internet service and we have just aggressively launched in the last week in mass media our CAD99.90 triple play bundle which is anchored in the 50-meg service and Personal TV and Personalizer and Phone and so we certainly anticipate that package will be the building block that our customers build off of, but we haven't quite tipped it into most category yet

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [23]

Okay, so perhaps maybe put another way, when people choose that bundle, that Plan Personalizer bundle, would it be fair to say that most or close to half are taking that standard internet rather than tearing down?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP - Operations   [24]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [25]

But I think, again, even if you look at the recent increase in speeds and extreme from 15 mega bits to 25 mega bits per second, that's tremendous value for customers and that alone supports again the pricing power of additional value to them

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [26]

Okay, thanks and one final follow-up. I was struck by your numbers on Star Choice. You continue to grow subscribers there in a tough competitive environment. Could you give us a sense of the resilience there? Are most of those customers do you think in non-cabled areas, and of the ones who are saying cable areas, how many do you think would be in big cities that might ultimately be vulnerable to IPTV?

Jim Cummins,  Shaw Communications Inc - GVP - Shaw Satellite Operations   [27]

Hi, Glen. It's Jim. A big portion of our base is in rural Canada, but they certainly see the value and the flexibility within the services that we have. A think a big key for us certainly in the rural areas, is not only the options that they have and the service their team provides, and we go to great lengths just like any Shaw product across the Company here, we're really focusing on retention, churn and real first class customer service, so our customers enjoy the service with the value of that, especially the rural areas, we have certainly seen not a big large number of customers churning out because of rate increases, which we've done quite a few in the last little while here, but they love the service, they love the flexibility and at the end of the day, it's most of our customers are in rural Canada

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [28]

Bob Beck from CIBC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Beck,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [31]

Thanks, good afternoon. I've got a couple questions. Firstly on the Arris box, obviously great potential here. Can you remind us what your thoughts are as far as getting that penetrated into the system, your current views on the sales versus rental on the box side, given it's a major shift in customer premise equipment?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP - Operations   [32]

Yes, Bob. It's Jay. We've had good success so far. We've come in at fairly high-end price point and really haven't done any advertising to try and drive demand. Quite frankly, as we roll this into all of our markets, it is a new platform with a new interface and a new provisioning system and a new installation process so its taken us about 3 weeks in each of our markets to get up to full targeted capacity and that works for us given that we're gearing for the back-to-school period to really start to drive the Arris Gateway product. We've got really good things happening in the good, better best from our digital set top perspective, the digital network upgrade that we've talked about, and the good space, we'll be deploying DCT 700s and boxes from Pace that will offer value and in the better space, we've got a new PVR coming with ultimate user interface and we've got in the best space the Arris Gateway, so we're still playing with the various permutations on what's included with Personalizer, what are the tradeoff on PVRs and without getting too fine a point on that, you'll see as we ramp through the summer you'll be able to see how that translates to customer value so it's not just about the gateway. There's things happening at all levels

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [33]

But there's a segment in retail. I was in the Story of the Day and the chapter had just come from the Arris training session and he said the thing they're really looking forward to on the retail is the whole DNA, where all of the other devices that they are selling actually work in concert with our Arris gateway box so I know I was on a talk show in Victoria with a bunch of geeky kind of guys, but they were looking forward to Victoria getting that, especially with that BMA deal and the addition to the next provision, so there's excitement around the box

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Beck,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [34]

Okay, that's helpful, thanks. Just on the Plan Personalizer, is there any costs associated with your running this through your system? Obviously it's pretty complex for your billing system. Is it up to task on that, or should we expect to see some costs related to sort of keeping up with this custom process?

Bradley Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [35]

Bob, I don't think it's overly complex for the billing system. Their packages, we've always packaged them in packages, and there aren't any issues there. Obviously, the secret sauce of Plan Personalizer is it's maintaining very strong ARPUs and has dramatically lowered our cost, not hard to tell by looking through the packages we've been able to provide value for customers with services that are low-cost to us, and make them low-cost for customers and move other services around so one of the big advantages for us in Personalizer while things are starting to see in the margin is the reduction of programming costs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Beck,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [36]

Just my last question, it's on the free cash flow. You've got CAD553 million after 9 months, you've got a CAD600 million target. I know media is negative free cash in Q4. I suspect there's a pick up in cash tax but perhaps, Steve can you talk a bit because that looks like it's achievable. I know there's a fair bit of CapEx perhaps with this upgrade on the internet side, but if you can just speak anecdotally to that because it seems pretty reachable to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, CFO   [37]

What I would say, Bob, is we talked about CAD550 million in the core businesses and we talked about CAD50 million for the 10 months of free cash flow in media. I think we'll exceed a little bit of media but yes, we will have negative free cash flow obviously in the last quarter and part of the reason for that in media is that a lot of our spend on capital and the benefits are back-ended so we've got CAD20 million of capital spend and CAD20 million of benefit spend in the back end and then from our point of view, in the core cable business, we have quite a ramp in capital projected for the last quarter, and I would say that to the extent that the overall, let's not focus on the overall free cash flow figure of CAD600 million, to the extent we exceed that we may take an opportunity to be able to advance some capital spending because you've got to do it you may as well advance it anyway, so I hope that answers your question

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [40]

Great. Thanks, good afternoon. First congratulations on the strong financial results. I just wanted to expand on a question that Glen had asked on the cable side. Brad, I think you said on the last conference call that your goal is to achieve 80% digital penetration by end of year, and given where we are at the end of I guess fiscal Q3, we need to see some sequential improvement in the digital net adds. How would you get to the 80% penetration target, so wanted to get an update on your thoughts on that. Do you still expect to achieve the 80% target by the end of the year and perhaps more broadly, do you think the launch of the Shaw Gateway, the Plan Personalizer and also the increased internet speed will be sufficient to suspend your cable subscriber market share or do you think that we may immediate to supplement that with some promotional offerings in the quarters ahead? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [41]

Well, so I'll answer your first one. So as you see in the numbers, we're meeting the target and we're coming close to it. We've had a little regroup of a little small project called the Digital Network Upgrade as we're aligning the resources and plan to get around that, so we've said what we're going to do up to 80% and now we're taking that next phase, and we're certainly comfortable that's on its way to 100 over time here

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP - Operations   [42]

And amplify that, it's Jay. Just to give you a sense on the digital numbers, we're really, we have advanced our Digital Network Upgrade and the move from the tiers to digital-only probably a little sooner than was originally contemplated in our 5 year plan when we started the digital strategy and that's what you've seen in our digital results in this quarter, as we really were completing that project and winding that out, and beginning the digital network upgrade, to give you a little bit of flavor how the digital network upgrade is going to flow in terms of subscriber numbers, what we have said is we're going to repatriate the tiers and launch our Phase II services by August 31

The mechanics of that is we're going to do that in 15 5-week sprints and so we'll do neighborhood-by-neighborhood conversions 5 weeks at a time, so if you do the math on that you'll begin to see in Q4, certainly an update from Q3 in terms of digital penetration but really ramping digital gains in terms of Q1, Q2, and Q3 as we move those services off analog, so it's obviously just a shift in focus and clearly for the next fiscal year, an opportunity for strong digital and ARPU gains through this program

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [43]

I see, got it. And on the promotional side, do you feel that, it sounds like from your earlier comments that you feel pretty good with the current competitive environment. I don't know if I'm reading too much into you saying that maybe promotional offerings are not as necessary going forward?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP - Operations   [44]

Yes, and so I think we've settled into a little bit of stability it here, certainly our competitor continues to offer rich hardware offers along with rich introductory offers and we've done some selective matching of those offers. We're happy to compete as much as our competitor would like to compete, and certainly are prepared to do that, but that having been said certainly on a macro level our promotional discounts have continued a very nice downward trend over the course of the last 7 months, and we certainly see that trend continuing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [45]

And Phillip, I think you're seeing Personalizer take effect as a tool that we can use in retention, acquisitions and gives us lots of flexibility, so you're going to see that tend to be used more

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [46]

Got it. Thank you very much

Tim Casey from BMO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [48]

Yes, couple things. One, you provided some guidance on the digital migration. I'm just wondering if there are any additional costs that will run through OpEx or any extraordinary CapEx as you manage that transition in 2012, and just as a point of clarification, should we assume you get to 100% by the end of say 2013, will it take that long?
  And second question is back to media. Paul, is there anything you can tell us about the profit performance this year with respect to conventional versus specialty? I'm assuming specialty is more of a steady gain. I'm just curious if you've seen a real pick up in the profitability at Global as the operating leverage kicks in with a better revenue environment and once again, if you expect any volatility in 2012. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [49]

Yes, so Tim, in terms of the digital migration, we certainly funded the digital migration and it's funded in the guidance this year for the portion that we're doing this Summer and its certainly funded in our capital model for next year which I think we'll be in a position to talk about in more detail on the next call, Steve. Just basic in analog and mixed percentage, so what we're doing is taking our discretionary tier services off analog so customers will continue to be able to receive analog basic services both on the first set and analog customer and then all of our customers on analog extra outlets so that would lead the customers with channels 2 to 28 still available on our analog so for sure there will be a portion of the base that remains there so this program won't drive us all the way to 100% but obviously the compelling value will be on the digital side

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, CFO   [50]

I think, Jim, it's fair to say as you hit that second phase it's as you move the whole base over to digital and you go through some of the nuances with some of the customer base, you're going to have to continue to focus and work on that but it may not fall as easy as the first phase

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc - President - Shaw Media   [51]

It's Paul here. Just in response to the question concerning the OTA business and how it's doing and what the prospects are, first of all from a revenue standpoint, we enjoyed quite a bounce back here compared to last year, and the ad revenue was kind of beyond mid single digit so that was pretty gratifying and we're bullish on conventional, and we've got a new attitude about how we think we can build that business and I think a lot of folks at the station level believe that there's real growth opportunities there through the news, and so we want to continue to build on that. From an EBITDA standpoint, it's of course a minor contributor although it is positive, and we think we can, as long as we can continue with that revenue growth, we can build on the margin that's there. I guess it's kind of a margin that in kind of the teens, that area at this point but we certainly think we can continue to build on it over time

Greg MacDonald from Macquarie

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Research Equities - Analyst   [53]

Thanks, good afternoon guys. A question I want to ask you on is cable margins and in particular, two things. Can you talk a little bit about program with the expectations over the next year or so, seems to me like a shift from conventional towards specialty as what we're seeing here, particularly with Bell talking about increasing TSN rates over the next 3 or 4 years by a pretty big magnitude. I suspect Rogers might follow with Sportsnet

Number one, do you feel like the pressure there is something that could impact margins and number two, pretty good cost productivity in the quarter, what's the sustainability opportunity there because cable companies haven't traditionally focused aggressively on cost, so just something that gives you comfort that margin pressure is not something we should worry about going forward. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [54]

Greg, it's Peter and maybe the industry doesn't focus on margins but we're renowned for focusing on margins so that will never be anything that we turn away from. It's all focused on cost. On the programming cost, we actually have met with the Bell Media folks, and we're I think pleased with the progress we're making there and I think we've reported previously that we actually have already got a 5 year agreement with the folks over at Rogers, so what really helped us is that we also have a certain degree of neighbors with our own media programming, and to the extent there's an awareness of that, and that there's a recognition that we all have value in products, it may not necessarily be in the sports genre, but we also have very valuable products as well, so we think that the reciprocity if you will, is going to benefit Shaw just as it has benefited and will benefit both Rogers and Bell Media

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Research Equities - Analyst   [55]

I didn't mean to imply that you haven't focused on margin in the past but it goes to my point. Are there a lot more cost opportunities in this business than what you've seen in the past and it's worth asking because this has been a growth industry. I'm not sure how anyone would categorize it now but you're not going 10% anymore

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP - Operations   [56]

Greg, it's Jay. On the cost structure, we did what was right first which was a very difficult and emotional reorganization of the business that also came with some benefits in terms of making more fleet of foot and the ability to innovate. We're working very aggressively on the second round of cost containment. We just completed a complete review of all of our cost and supply chain and we're going to be implementing the first round of this isn't really staffing changes, as the whole approach to how we manage our business, so we'll be implementing the first round of that over the course of the next quarter, so we think we've got plenty of opportunity to grow margins and to continue on the cost side

 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [59]

Yes, just a couple questions on programming as well. Paul, can you talk about the up front market and if we should have any consideration or any concerns about the programming costs on the media side coming into next year?

Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc - President - Shaw Media   [60]

Sure, I'd be happy to, Peter. We were pretty prudent with our expenditures when we were in Los Angeles. We were able to do so because we didn't have that many slots to fill. When we came back to present to our customers, they were really pleased with the schedule. We had roughly the same amount of simulcast programming as we had last year which is about 12 hours which is thought to be an awful good level, plus we had shows that we did pick out we're well received and we're quite enthusiastic about them, as were they

You were right on the up-front negotiations. They went exactly as we kind of hoped they would. We were able to tie a field with all five of our major customers and volume-wise, able to increase it compared to a year ago, and finally, we're able to exact some pretty solid, I'm going to say mid to high single digit TPM increases on some key properties on the specialty side that we really, they were growing and really doing super so we felt strongly that stations like Nat Geo and History, that they had done so well, they really deserved an inordinately high CPM improvement and that we stuck to our guns on that, and were successful, so all in all, it fell together really well for us this year and we're thrilled about it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities - Analyst   [61]

And then on the cable programming side, I read an article that said that TSN could be going from CAD1.07 up to the CAD4 to CAD5 range. Would that be outrages or are we looking at some sort of magnitude increase in that range over time?

Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc - President - Shaw Media   [62]

No, that doesn't work within our portfolio and I think we're getting close to having something that works for both of us

Maher Yaghi from Desjardins Securities

 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [65]

Yes, thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted maybe to go back to the basics on subscribers on the video side. Now that you have launched your new media gateway, how long do you expect before we should see a change in the trends, which are, right now negative on the video side and can you maybe comment on, if you can, on those customers that are leaving on the video side, what kind of product portfolio they are leaving behind, if any, in terms of internet and telephony?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP - Operations   [66]

It's Jay. So let me deal with the last question first and then we can read through it. I think it's clear that Telus and Shaw are both trying to own the customers home, and so I think what you're seeing is most of the activity between our 2 companies and the activity is intense 2-way activity. It's certainly not just one-way activity. Customers bringing all of their business with them to whatever provider they select. Clearly, our primary competitor is having the most success selling TV to their internet and phone customers, and you've seen us enjoy a very nice 6-year run selling phone to our TV and internet customers, so there is absolutely a pull through. It's less than the percentage of penetration that we have in those products, so you can read into that the more products you have, the less likely we are to lose you, but there's certainly a pull through both ways on both sides of the business

I'm not personally convinced that this is about getting to positive video subscribers. If you think historically when the Triple Play battle started, we lost Manitoba. We probably had a draw in Saskatchewan and we won big in Alberta and BC, so if you look at our environment 7 or 8 years later, you're seeing some adjustments in Alberta and BC, and we're winning successfully in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, so I think some of this is just business cycle. That having been said, we're prepared to compete as much as we want to compete and don't read into this that we aren't serious about growing our business, because we are very serious about growing our business

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [67]

And it's not a chase to the bottom as we said. it's about creating shareholder value and a little bit of a longer term focus, so Jay's very accurate. I'm just going to add something that's a little bit different and we just come out of our Board meeting and we had quite a discussion and one of the topics that come up with sports, and where we are as a Company, and we looked at sports in 2010 and made all the right reasons from a defensive play from leverage and looking at that but the costs as we know it, have dramatically gone up

We looked at all of the major sports rights which were pretty well secured, and certainly making sure there's nothing that comes available and so in those factors, we looked at it plus the fact we got some comfort knowing we've been able to do the deal with TSN and Sportsnet, knowing that on our side, the leverage we have and the focus we have as a team is unbelievable in what we've been able to produce, and we're really comfortable going forward that's our focus and that's the opportunity to grow, so we will not be pursuing the sports strategy going forward

Okay, and just a follow-up, in terms of I understand you guys are not going to predict when if those trends and video are going to change, but when you look at the broader scheme of things, when you lose about 45,000 subscribers a year in the video, it's going to be very hard to make it up by selling internet and phone. I'm just basically trying to figure out, how much will you hold on to that ARPU, sorry the price on your Gateway, digital Gateway, if you really need to change that trajectory from negative to positive and if you're going to subsidize that Moxie box eventually down the road, is there any way of thinking how long you will take before making that decision to change the subsidy on your Moxie box?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP - Operations   [69]

Well you made an assumption that we hadn't made yet which is subsidizing the Gateway. I think we've been very clear that we have a very attractive pricing plan for the Gateways and the Gateways are only one of the weapons that we have in this competition that we're dealing with, and we have as Jay talked about, we have sort of the middle of the road also very compelling product with PVRs and the new guys. We have the Shaw Movie Club, we have a whole host of things that we're doing so that the proposition for our customers is where do I get the greatest value, and where do I get the greatest value, clearly we've said broadband is where we want to have our leadership, because along with broadband comes the other products whether it's telephone product in the Shaw Plan Personalizer and also the kind of flexibility customers have to choose their own services so this is a, I'll call it a holistic kind of competitive battle, and that Arris is just one of the things we have in our bag

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [70]

Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [71]

So let me add, this is Brad, from an industry perspective. When you look at the economics of this, we're pulling through internet and phone customers which are both very high-margin customers for us because we're running those across the fixed base with very low costs, so to the extent that we're losing video subscriber on the other side there's a very high relation of programming costs there, our programming costs and this is public information through the CRTC are 35% of our revenues. You could imagine that our competitor who's smaller, probably has higher programming costs than that, so the net margin when you pull through a video customer and you've got CAD1,000 of COA by the time you've added in free HDPVR, free box, and an install, the economics of that are much more difficult than the kind of pull through that we're trying to make on our side and with the 50 megabit service, that drives higher ARPU and all of that is extremely profitable stuff

 Colin Moore,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [73]

Great. Thanks, and good afternoon, everybody. My question is also on the personal plan and just curious how people are interacting with your video programming options. Obviously, you've given them a little more flexibility. Just wondering if people are taking similar amounts of programming as they did before, and also maybe how that's impacting your programming cost per subscriber. It sounds like that might also be going down, which could be offsetting that a little bit. Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [74]

You're right on both points

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP - Operations   [75]

Yes, Colin, you're right on both points, so we're still selling almost 3 theme packs between the higher end of between 2 and 3 theme packs from customer and so customers are still taking lots of TV, and if you look at the customers who have converted their services over, we've seen a very small drop in ARPU, although these are high-value customers, our ARPU was over CAD130 when we looked at this, and we've seen a larger drop in programming costs than we've seen in a drop in ARPU, so obviously it improves the margin percent and it improves the margin dollars as well and I think you're starting to see that in some of the turnaround that we've gotten in the quarter

 Colin Moore,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [76]

Dvai Ghose from Canaccord

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [78]

Yes, thanks very much. Three questions, if I may. The first is on wireless. I understand you're still pursuing your strategic review, but Rogers has said fairly publicly that helping other wireless cos through network sharing, sorry, cable cost through network sharing and wireless, is tough for them because they are so much more advanced in wireless and have significant market share both in western Canada, where you reside, as well as in Quebec. Do you think that makes it difficult to sign an agreement, and if so are you still open to pursuing a standalone, a resale, abandoning wireless all together? Is everything still up in the air?

Bradley Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [79]

Probably the last one makes sense. You know, we're still in that strategic review and there's, these aren't small decisions. They aren't very simple to make. They're quite complicated when you look at it. We're talking to a variety of different people, looking at a variety of different things and we'll come back within the month

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [80]

Okay, fair enough and then on this sorry to belabor the point, but clearly, the competition with Telus, the pricing and the maturation is not just affecting your core cable business, if you look at your total RGUs, I think they fell to 48,000 net additions this quarter from 181,000 a year ago, and 65,000 just a quarter ago, so at the current run rate you're doing annualized RGU growth of less than 3%. Is that a concern for you and I go back to the question about the pricing lever and do you need to relax the pricing lever a bit to stimulate sub growth?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, CFO   [81]

Well, we've already talked about ARPU and the ARPU and the pricing power. In terms of Jay has talked about the fact that we can't race to the bottom here. We saw what happened in the first quarter of the year and the fourth quarter of last year, when we were overly promotional in our pricing and so we're pursuing a philosophy of making money, and doing it in the most rational way, and I'm a bit disappointed by your comments, in The Globe quite frankly, that you're advocating that Telus is winning the war here and yet you've set up high expectations which are above consensus, and then said we missed the expectations so I don't understand how that theory works

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [82]

No, that's fair but I think you missed the consensus subscriber expectations as well to be fair

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, CFO   [83]

You read the other Analyst reports and see what they say versus what you said in The Globe today

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [84]

That's for them to decide, sure. And then my last question is on the guidance. I'm a little bit confused because the CanWest guidance seems well ahead as you've suggested. The cable and satellite EBITDA growth guidance below, so Steve, should we just focus on the CAD600 million free cash flow number?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, CFO   [85]

Yes, you should, yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [86]

That's good. Thanks very much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, CFO   [87]

As I said it's an extent that we're above the CAD600 million we may advance and that will likely be advanced in the quarter on cable and satellite side of the business so we're really looking at that number of CAD600 million now

 Vince Valentini, TD Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [2]

Yes, thanks very much. I have three questions, one on cable EBITDA, one on interest expense, and one on CapEx. In terms of cable EBITDA, I guess any wireless losses are now being included in the cable segment, and we're now at the proper run rate for what your support structure fees should be. So can we take the Q4 number as a decent run rate heading into next year? And simply doing some simple math on that, if you take Q4 times 4 and compare it to what you did for all of fiscal 2011, that's 5% growth. So is it fair to say 5% is a baseline for cable EBITDA growth for next year?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [3]

Well, I understand the math you're doing, Vincent, and let me just comment on the guidance. We didn't put specific numbers in for a cable increase. We did 6% this year, and certainly our 10% in the fourth quarter is the highest in the industry. And so for next year, we will be striving to hit that 5% to 6% cable EBITDA growth, but when we give numbers, we like to give them as commitments. And given the amount of movement in the market, and uncertainty, we've decided not to give commitments this year, but I think that your math stands up well. And certainly, that's a level that we would be targeting, again in that 5% to 6% level

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [4]

Okay, that's great. In terms of interest expense, a run rate question as well. I guess there was some refinancing done late in the fourth quarter, so is it fair to say there should be a decent step down in your interest costs starting in Q1 from the Canwest refinancing?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [5]

And yes, but that would be offset as well by the preferred shares that we issued. So debt levels have gone up, so there will be an offset there, Vincent

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [6]

Okay. And last one on CapEx. So, seems like you've got the digital network upgrade and some Wi-Fi spending, both somewhat lumpy and front-end loaded in 2012. Can you give us any look even directionally beyond 2012 once some of those programs come down, as to what your CapEx might do?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [7]

Hi, Vince. It's Peter Bissonnette, and certainly Jay can jump in here as well, but clearly you've designed the DNU and the Wi-Fi projects as projects that have a lifespan. The DNU will be completed by next year, and so there will be we'll call it a positive trend in terms of CapEx going down. Wi-Fi still will have a year left, but it's more heavily weighted next year than it would be the following year, so I think it's fair to say that there would be a downward trend in CapEx

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [8]

Jeff Fan, Scotia Capital

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [10]

Thanks, and good afternoon. I wanted to ask you about the business segment, and perhaps if you can give us a little bit of color of how much it's contributing to your business today and what your plans are with respect to expanding into that segment of the margin, given how attractive that opportunity could be

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, Operations   [11]

Sure, Jeff. It's Jay. We continue to have good momentum on the business side. We're seeing about 20% growth year-over-year and have had a nice start to the year in September. We are seeing the market shift a little bit upmarket for us. As you know, we've been very successful in the very small and therefore you've seen some very nice subscriber numbers that are included in our numbers in previous years. We started to move into the mid-market space, so our growth is shifting a little bit to the revenue and EBITDA growth, a bit more so than subscriber growth, but we're certainly still headed down that path

You know, a great example is we just one of the things that we're doing on a client that we wouldn't otherwise have ad access to, we just won a nice bid with the city of Calgary and have taken 8,000 DID lines with them in the 311 business. And it's an example of the kind of opportunity that's available to us today that wasn't available to us a year or two ago

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [12]

Could you give us a sense of the size of the market that's within your cable footprint and your addressable market?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, Operations   [13]

Yes, so I guess the challenge is the definition of addressable. The economics of the model are such that to the extent that we're close to the business, it makes, it certainly makes economic sense. So the business household pass number is probably not the way to look at this. We're in 220 million a year at this point, and we think we've got about 5% of the market opportunity

Glen Campbell, Merrill Lynch

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [16]

Yes, thanks very much. A follow-up question on CapEx. As you look out beyond the lumpy spend you've got ahead, can you give us a sense of what you think the cable business would require on an ongoing basis, maybe even excluding the set tops? And maybe just to put the set-top investment in perspective, can you talk a little bit about how much you spent in the year just completed on set tops? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Unidentified Company Representative,  Shaw Communications Inc   [17]

Sure. I'll take the set-top question first and then you can go, we can work through your second piece. We spent on average of just over CAD200 million a year the last three years on success-based capital in the cable side of the business. We think we're in a very good spot with our set-top box strategy. As we talked in the past about our good, better, best approach, good being our Motorola DCT700, better being our [DCX] platform, both in the HD box and the HD DVR, which is big parts of our plan going forward, and best being Gateway. So I think if you look at our pricing plan now that we've got all of our boxes into primetime, we're looking at a subsidy on the Gateway home of certainly less than CAD300 and significantly less than that in the other segments

And then, there's routine capital as you can well imagine, Glen, which would include new plan construction. There still is a certain amount of growth going on. There are new subdivisions. It's not as extensive as it might have been five years ago. We also have a hub segmentation asset category that we'll continue as we have gone from 2,000 homes per node down into the sub-700 homes per node. And of course that all goes to the quality of services that we're able to offer our customers. It goes to the ability of providing video on demand with lower and lower contention because of the serving nodes

There is an IT component. As you know, we're going through a transformation within our Company from an older legacy system to a new system that will provide us with the flexibility to do the kinds of things we need to do in both managing wireless, the new Gateway products, and the kind of packaging that becomes a part, more of al a carte packaging. So there certainly will be an ongoing need to continue to do that. There are [some] system upgrades though

We're doing a large, I'll call it comprehensive digital network upgrade, but beyond that, we'll call it the traditional spectrum expansion that gives us the kind of capability. We're trying to move all of our systems into that 750, 850 spectrum capacity on a digital basis. It gives us tremendous amount of capacity to offer 100 and 250 megabit services to go well beyond the capacity of any of our IT-based competitors. And so those are ongoing kind of capital expectations for us that will just be a part of the business. And then as we've said, the DNU has a time frame and will be completed by the end of next year, and as well as the Wi-Fi, which the major portion of that will be done in the next two

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [18]

Maybe just a quick follow-up on that. If you look at the US operators, and there's obviously some differences, they're all spending say more than 10% of sales if you include the success based capital. But if you back that out, they're spending less, so as you get through these lumpy spend projects, is there any reason to think that your core CapEx, excluding the set-top boxes would have to be more than 10% of your cable revenues?

Unidentified Company Representative,  Shaw Communications Inc   [19]

Well, I think the one thing as we realize, is that we're probably in the most competitive environment of any cable operator in America, right here in our own backyard in western Canada. And so there are -- the DNU for instance, the digital network upgrade, is driven by that competitive environment, so to the extent we see a downward trend after those [one-off] and those projects are completed, I don't know that getting into a 10% realm would be really realistic. At this time, it would be hard to make a commitment to that, but it's going to trend downward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [20]

And Glen, part of those numbers, as you know, are things like Cablevision, who's fully built out on Wi-Fi [radiant] has taken those moves, and we've been advancing our capital in terms of digital penetration. And in Canada, none of the cable operators by what we show have CapEx intensity 120%. Everybody's over 20% at this time. So I don't think we're an outlier in the market, but we should certainly see it coming under 20% in the near future

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Unidentified Company Representative,  Shaw Communications Inc   [21]

And prudence is also [part of that]. It will continue to be that. I think we're known for being prudent in the way we spend capital, because you can spend a lot more than we are. We're choosing not to. We think that the [weapons] is giving us competitively really match the kind of needs we have and the means we have

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [22]

And we'll continue to do that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [26]

Yes, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to get an update on the Plan Personalizer. I think you mentioned in the last quarterly call that it was a net benefit to EBITDA, because even though it gives customers more flexibility to perhaps rationalize their bill, it was generating a greater reduction in programming cost. Do you still believe that this is working the way -- this is still the case? I think you mentioned in your press release that programming costs are higher, but just want to see if you still view the Plan Personalizer as a net benefit to EBITDA. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, Operations   [27]

Sure, Phillip. It's Jay. I think if you look at the impact of Plan Personalizer and customer choice, we're seeing it as really being quite flat to EBITDA. There's a slight reduction in ARPU and a basically an offsetting reduction in terms of network fees. And the program's going very well and exceeding our expectations to date

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [28]

Okay, maybe just a quick follow-up on also on the TV side. Aside from optic TV, have you seen any changes in terms of Bell's satellite TV offering? Have they introduced more attractive promotions at all during the quarter?

No

 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [32]

Hi, can you hear me?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [33]

Yes. We can hear you, Tim

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [34]

You announced yesterday you completed a long-term carriage agreement with Bell Media. I'm just wondering if you can talk a little bit about term on that deal and what the implications might be on cable margins. I mean I think we're all assuming those sports channel cable fees are going to go up dramatically over the next little while. Just hoping you could comment on that. And another question, shifting gears, just looking at your voice penetration, the number of subs you added was still quite strong and it declined over the previous year. But just wondering if you can comment on how much runway there is left in that market given other things coming on board, like eventually wireless substitution in the market and things like that. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Unidentified Company Representative,  Shaw Communications Inc   [35]

So Tim, on the Bell deal, it's a substantial deal. It represents 30 programming services. They're our largest program supplier by virtue of the number of services. With respect to the term, it's a reasonable term. It's a five-year deal, so it takes us out to 2016. It gives us sufficient flexibility in terms of packaging programming services, consistent with the theory and the practice of the Plan Personalizer

That's all good. TSN, the sports service, we're very, very comfortable with the rates that we struck. The service remains on basic. We have the ability to offer TSN HD essentially the way we want to offer it, which is likely going to be twinned at some point in the future. At this point, it's part of a sports package in the HD package, and it just gives us long-term stability terms of rates. It's -- from our perspective, it's a good deal

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [36]

I guess it goes without saying that's obviously factored into your guidance. Are you implying you're not expecting margin pressure from --?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [37]

It's factored in

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, Operations   [38]

And then on the voice question, Tim. It's Jay again. I think we have seen a shift in the landscape where our competitive environment is to be the communications provider for the entire home. And so in that world, there's still is significant opportunity for us to make voice gains, and we're quite bullish about that side of the business. That having been said, clearly the market has shifted from single product adds and the way the market behaved three or four years ago to a customer choosing a communications provider. And we certainly believe, as the leading player in the TV and internet space, which is what matters, that we're in an ideal position to be able to offer the complete communication services to customers

Rob Goff, Northland Capital Partners

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Northland Capital Partners Inc. - Analyst   [40]

Thank you very much. Two questions if I may. The first would go to the pricing leverage in the marketplace, and I believe you successfully put through CAD2 rate increases a year ago beginning September. Were you successful this year round? And the second question would be with regards to new product roll-outs, we noticed where you're doing the security product into the NDU. What are your plans at the individual house level?

Unidentified Company Representative,  Shaw Communications Inc   [41]

Well, let's answer the question on security and NDU. That may be somebody else. It's not something that we're doing, but we will continue to look at fresh ways of providing services. On the last call we heard about plain ordinary telephone service, POTS. Well, there's some great things that we're looking forward to offering in a much higher-quality, high-fidelity type of phone service that will enrich, if you will, the experience that customers have. And we think that that's -- we're excited about what can happen in regards to what will be plain ordinary telephone service

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, Operations   [42]

And Rob, we can certainly take the question on rates. You can't really take a rate card, traditional rate card approach in a world where we've got Personalizer. We've got 50 meg internet speeds and CAD99 bundles. And so you need to be a little bit careful in terms of extrapolating out legacy price changes, considering there's an opportunity for customers to right-size and to find the right level of customized service in a way that wasn't there before. In terms of our current change to our legacy rates, effective November 1, our internet packages went up in essence CAD3, and our TV packages went up CAD2. And we've seen sort of the normal course kind of response to that change in rate. Lots of opportunity for customers who want to repackage and bundle and find something that works for them

Greg MacDonald, Macquarie Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [45]

Thanks. Good afternoon. Company's decision to subsidize the Gateway solution made we wonder if this is still a defensive strategy or if now there is some offense to it. Can you speak to that? Retention still focused, or is there some acquisition ascribed to this now? And then I have a quick follow-up on the same subject

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [46]

Yes, Greg, I wouldn't read too much into what you see there. Certainly we are marketing Gateway for the first time. While we've had the benefit of talking on this call to each of you about it for a number of months, we haven't openly talked to our customers about it. We think we're in a nice price point for our high-end product, and it continues to be a high-end product. We've been successful in getting significant price reductions from the vendor, and we're certainly on a price declination path that we're quite happy with [theirs]

So I wouldn't read anything too much into the subsidy that we talked about for the whole home being well under CAD300 is a completely loaded rate, including installation and the remotes. And in practical terms when we've talked about no subsidy in the past, we've been talking generally about the equipment cost directly, not so much loaded cost. So I don't think you'll see a big variation there, and this is clearly a high-end product. We're really excited about our Motorola PVR products that are in market at CAD198, and we think that will be our mainstream product. That having been said, there's a halo effect around product leadership, and so you're going to continue to hear noise about the absolute best television product in the market

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [47]

Okay, that's helpful. And the second question relates to the future outlook for the cable network as well. A lot of companies now thinking of moving more toward an IPTV type platform, so you've talked about your digital network upgrade. Maybe could you talk a little bit about the operating platform plans? And I guess what I'm trying to get at is an edge product like the Gateway product the solution you're looking for whole home PVR and/or user guides for the long term? Or are you thinking more core network upgrades like an IPTV type solution would imply?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [48]

Greg, it's Peter Bissonnette

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [49]

Hi, Peter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [50]

How are you? I was down in cable [laws] recently so we're looking at the various different approaches that large MSOs are taking with respect to transition to IP. And they're actually looking to us as somewhat the leaders in the space because of the approach we're taking with our IP transition, which is really to take the best of both worlds. So from an IP perspective, the look and the feel is really what makes it apparent to customers

And with the Gateway product as well as with the [Dream Park] HTML5 that we're doing on the DCX product, we're benefiting right now from the look and feel of an IP product gives you, but we're also benefiting from the [Quam] MPEG4 quality of the pictures that are provided over our network. And so, there's absolutely no other advantage, frankly, at this time to be going [holus bolus] from where we are right to an IP product. This is a great transition, because it actually moderates the capital that's required to do the service transition and its immediacy gives the customers who choose to have that IP experience a great IP experience

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [51]

And you mentioned that there's a price decrease from the vendor over the past year or two years, or whatever it's been. Is that really weighing into the way you think about this as well?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [52]

Well, that was an expectation over time, right, Jay? That as we launched the product, and we're kind of the drivers of this, that as there's more take-up, as there's more obviously demand, that the pricing would start to reflect that, and we're now starting to see that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, Operations   [53]

And we're absolutely serious about working the price declination curve and on all of our capital items, including set tops from all vendors. So we've seen some good results from all of our major vendors in that area

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [54]

I think, Greg, it's fair to say that you would -- you're going to see us do a stepped approach, which you're seeing with the Gateway towards IPTV, where some others might be taking a little bit more of a jump. It's important to manage that customer experience and the whole process as you move to that

Yes, thank you for taking my question. I just want to maybe touch base on the media side. It hasn't been approached yet. I wanted to ask you if you can give some more maybe some update on -- I see in your notes that you mentioned revenues were up 7% on a yearly basis. Could you maybe tell us what the quarterly level growth rate was organically? And also on the EBITDA side, it's -- there's a lot of seasonality. We understand that. However, can you maybe give us some perspective on seasonality for next year? Was this quarter affected by other effects of that seasonality that had impacts of EBITDA? Maybe just more clarity on that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul Roberson,  Shaw Communications Inc - President, Shaw Media   [58]

Sure. It's Paul Robertson here, and I'm happy to kick it off, and maybe Steve will come in behind if needed. I -- from a revenue standpoint, the fourth quarter this year was up a moderately a year ago, 2 points, and EBITDA was a CAD12 million compared to basically breakeven last year. We reported in our last quarterly meeting that fourth quarter in the broadcast business is usually a time when if you can come around at breakeven, it's probably a fairly normal quarter. In terms of how the seasonality works, the first quarter is the largest by far and represents maybe up to kind of 40% of the total. Second quarter is considered low season. Third quarter's stronger, and fourth quarter's a really low season

So you have this first and third high season, second and fourth low season, and when the revenue fluctuates to that extent and your cost base tends to be more even, you're going to see the differences in EBITDA. So really for us to track a quarter compared to the previous quarter, it really doesn't make a whole lot of sense in terms of trying to follow us, I think, as opposed to cable where you're looking at the run rate. In our case what you'd need to do is compare us strictly to year ago to make sense out of it

There was nothing really that unusual or surprising about the fourth quarter. I think the revenue came in a little better than we expected it to, and there's always some program adjustments that you make in the fourth quarter to make sure your inventory is nice and clean without going into the new year. We had an adjustment in fourth quarter of F'11 and in F'10. I think they were similar in size, maybe a little less in F'11. So it was a fairly normal quarter in total, and I think we just have to start recalibrating off of the year-ago number

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [59]

Okay, that's helpful. Maybe I didn't catch your initial discussion about the fourth quarter year-on-year revenue growth. How much was it?

Paul Roberson,  Shaw Communications Inc - President, Shaw Media   [60]

Well the fourth quarter revenue was CAD210 million compared to CAD206 million a year ago

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [61]

CAD260 million?

Paul Roberson,  Shaw Communications Inc - President, Shaw Media   [62]

CAD206 million

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [63]

Okay, and just on another topic. On the CRTC's decision to ask the BDUs to be more -- offering more potential products and I mean for consumers to have more ability to choose their own programming, how much, if you look in Quebec where I live, we can choose our channels one by one. I know you have the Personalizer there that you offer your customers, but in your guidance, do you have any sensitivities? Or did you leave any potential impact from in case the CRTC demands that you offer a la carte products to all your clients?

Unidentified Company Representative,  Shaw Communications Inc   [64]

Well, look as a practical matter, we offer our customers a variety of choices. So they combine packages that they currently have, and a lot of them still love the packages they've got because they're good value. If they want greater choice, they can move to the Shaw Personalizer, which offers a reduced entry-level service, if you will, but still has probably some of the higher-value programming services. And then they can buy [thematic] packages

And that's what choice is about, and we already met that requirement to provide greater choice, plus historically, we've always offered all the new specialty services, all the ones that were licensed in sort of the last stage, whether it was a category A or B, on a purely pick-and-pay discretionary basis. So that continues, and from our perspective, we've met whatever requirements we have -- not necessarily driven by Commission requests, but what the market wants. And that's what we are doing now, and that's what we're doing with Personalizer, and we continue to do it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [65]

So in terms of offering more channels, more of your channels a la carte like it is done in Quebec, that's not something you're currently looking to do, right?

Paul Roberson,  Shaw Communications Inc - President, Shaw Media   [66]

No, and there's no need to do it. Nobody's asking for a la carte services other than the ones currently being offered. People are looking for packages

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [67]

Just to be clear, when all of those specialty services were launched, we were the only broadcast distributors that offered them on an a la carte basis, in packages that customers tailored themselves in totality. So we essentially already got a la carte and pick-and-pay programming offerings, and our customers seem satisfied with that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul Roberson,  Shaw Communications Inc - President, Shaw Media   [68]

Just to finish off with the Commission, I think you were looking more on affordability and a [scene] basic, and I don't think that we're really encouraging or pushing us to provide complete a la carte service that you're suggesting

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [69]

Okay, and maybe just come back on the media. Sorry to come back like this, but it seems your year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter is below the full-year growth rate. Was there something in the fourth quarter? Did you notice any deceleration in terms of advertising that is more a representation of what's going to happen next year? Or you think just the fourth-quarter growth rate was just a blip?

Paul Roberson,  Shaw Communications Inc - President, Shaw Media   [70]

Well, because the fourth quarter is really low season, it tends to have a little more variation year to year. It really doesn't do much for predicting the future

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [71]

And bear in mind, as Paul said before, on the last call, we told you to expect a breakeven in the fourth quarter which was similar to the breakeven we had last year. So we're ahead of our own expectations in terms of performance in the fourth quarter. I don't think there's anything that can be drawn out from that at this point

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [72]

 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest/Waterhouse Securities - Analyst   [2]

Question on subscribers -- I guess there was a pretty big uptick in the amount of basic cable subs you lost, especially versus first quarter of last year. But the new promotions, and especially that Visa card offer, obviously didn't start until the second quarter in December. I'm wondering if you can give us any color on what kind of traction you've seen from your new mass marketing strategy and that offer through December and into this year? Has there been a significant change in the trend line of subs versus what we saw in the first quarter?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [3]

Vince, I'll just say a couple things and maybe the guys will chime in. I think what you saw in the first quarter is we had a couple challenges in the customer care and it had an impact on our numbers. We're happy to say that we have made the moves to fix that and sure going forward that, that won't happen again. You had some impact in the quarter for that. I think in regards to Visa, it's early days. We've got some time here left, but we are pleased with the results

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest/Waterhouse Securities - Analyst   [4]

Is that Visa offer still in the market, Brad?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [5]

No, it isn't

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest/Waterhouse Securities - Analyst   [6]

Okay. If nobody else wants to chime in, just a second question would be on digital -- pretty strong growth there, almost 60,000 adds. Can you give us any color, maybe Jay, on what the mix was there? Is it a lot of the new Gateway boxes or just the more basic boxes going out the door?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP Operations   [7]

Yes, Vince, it is Jay. I think you'll see that it's both. We certainly had some very, very, very positive momentum on Gateway throughout the quarter and large gains in the Gateway space. As Brad mentioned, we're now also over 50% converted, the analog tier customers that we had in June when we started the DNU project. Certainly a portion of that net adds goes to that. I would say it's about equal in the impact

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest/Waterhouse Securities - Analyst   [8]

Okay. Thanks

 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [10]

You mentioned you had some challenges in customer care in the quarter that, I guess the inference is that they were isolated. Can you talk a little bit about what happened there? Second, could you provide a road map of product launches that you anticipate? You talked about the new DreamGallery for Motorola. Will you have a series of product launches through the year relative to your various offerings or could you give us a little more color on that? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP Operations   [11]

Tim, it's Jay again. We certainly experienced unprecedented call volumes in the late September through October period, and it's fair to say that we underestimated the amount of operational impact of not only the increasing competitive environment, but some of the major initiatives that we've had under way. We've made a number of changes in terms of our customer service organization and have not only made some dramatic changes in terms of leadership, but also much more aggressively reinforced our staffing in those areas. It is absolutely clear and Brad is so clear on this on a daily basis, that we're going to deliver an exceptional customer experience, rooted with all of our calls answered in our major centers in Canada. We're well on our way in terms of delivering everything that we need to deliver there and that commitment certainly won't change

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [12]

When sell side guys hear things like that, we automatically think that there's a cost component there. Should we expect a little bit higher cost and perhaps an impact on margin as we work through the year?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP Operations   [13]

Yes, for sure. People cost money. I think what you'll see is we're pretty much fully hired at this point and most of those costs will be reflected in the Q1 numbers. Although to be fair, some of them are reflected partially in the Q1 numbers, so I think you'll see a modest increase in terms of our cost structure. Important to note that with the digital network upgrade and some other initiatives, we've brought on a large number of temporary staff for that initiative. As we get fully hired, we'll be drawing that down, so there's certainly an offset

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [14]

Right. Last question for me, if you have any more color on product introductions that would be helpful? Also, can you remind us of when your last price increases went through?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP Operations   [15]

Sure. Certainly in terms of product introductions, we've got lots of momentum happening in the marketplace, both from a product launch perspective and pricing and packaging. You asked specifically about DreamGallery. Our DreamGallery guide looks great. It's in test with staff and friends and family right now and we're very excited about the feedback we're getting from it. We'll go with appropriate force and speed to launch as we think it's ready. It's certainly not that far into the future

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [16]

And price increases?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP Operations   [17]

Price increase -- we did our last price increase in legacy packaging, not in Personalizer on November 1, which was CAD2, and CAD3. If you're trying to model that out, we're generally looking about 5 million a month

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [20]

I wanted to just go back to the customer service issue and wondering if you are able to at least quantify what you think the impact was in the quarter with respect to subscribers? And whether this impacted across all three Triple Play services or whether there was any bigger impact in any one of those services? I'll start there and let you guys comment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP Operations   [21]

Jeff, there's no question that we had an impact across all three services. If you're not in a position to do business with your customers, it's going to impact the amount of business you do with your customers. To put an actual number on it, I don't think there's some science there, but it's certainly our view that the trend that we saw in Q1 subscribers had at least as much to do with our own internal gaps as it had to do with an intensifying competitive environment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [22]

Is it too early to say, though, whether the Q2 trends, at least what you're seeing so far, showed an improvement from what the experience was in Q1?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [23]

Jeff, I think we're a little early, as I said. We're pleased with where it's at, but there's a little bit of time left here and lots can happen, so it is a little early

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [24]

Okay. My second question is more on the strategic level. In the US last month, we saw an interesting transaction between Verizon Wireless and the cable companies. Just on a higher level, is that something that the Shaw organization can perhaps pursue sometime down the road? Have you given that any thoughts?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [25]

It's certainly got our interest and it really falls into our strategy, in wireless and the traditional network and really endorsing where we're going. You always keep the door open. You're always looking at things that if you can do it differently and we're always open for discussions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [26]

Okay. Thanks

Glen Campbell, Merrill Lynch

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [28]

First, on the Wi-Fi deployment, could you give us a sense of how much CapEx during the quarter went to that project, if you have any visibility on what it might be for the year?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP Operations   [29]

Well, for the year, Glen, we're looking at about CAD50 million of capital in the year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [30]

Okay and so should I conclude that there wasn't too much then during the quarter?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP Operations   [31]

We weren't fully on that run rate in the first quarter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [32]

A little bit behind

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP Operations   [33]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [34]

The second question -- on the small, medium business segment, could you talk about the trend on phone adds there, has it been fairly steady or up or down? As you're adding those subscribers, is there a significant drag-along in terms of the Internet and TV? In other words, is there a decent proportion of your TV and Internet adds that are in the small business segment?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP Operations   [35]

We're very happy with the progress that we're making on the business team. We're excited that John Piercy has taken over all things business at Shaw as our Group Vice President, starting in the end of November in that role and he's really got all of the right things happening in the business and creating nice momentum in terms of the funnel. I think our view of business is we're driving to a long-term revenue number and we're driving to long-term market share and I'm not sure you can necessarily translate that all the way through subscriber numbers. For example, the City of Calgary deal that we did enabled 8,000 individual lines

The way that counts for subscribers, using our accounting for PRIs and stuff is 600 and some lines were included in Q1 out of that particular transaction. I think the goal here is to drive meaningful, meaningful revenue. We're certainly driving subscriber adds in phone and Internet, less so in video in Q1. It's the Internet that drives this space for Shaw, not phone

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [36]

Okay, thanks. Capital intensity, if we look out beyond the Wi-Fi deployment and the digital network upgrade, do you have any more current thinking on where CapEx to sales might go in the cable segment?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP and CFO   [37]

I would say it's early for that, Glen, because we haven't decided what our priorities are in fiscal 2013. It depends partly on how fast or how strategically and how we want to deploy that Wi-Fi strategy and that's going to have a big impact on it. Other projects, like DNU, which may stretch a little bit into next fiscal year, will also fall off. You'll have some things coming off and other projects continuing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [38]

Okay. But once you get past that, maybe it's a couple years out? Could we see significantly under 20%, closer to 15%?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP and CFO   [39]

I'm not sure you get down as low as 15%. I wouldn't commit to that now. But certainly below 20%,as we said in the last call as well, is very reasonable in terms of once we get through some of these major initiatives

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [40]

Great. Thanks very much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [41]

Phillip Huang, UBS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [42]

Also on CapEx, on your success-based CapEx, it's up 43%. I think it's, by far, the highest it's ever been. I was wondering, was the level of activity on the boxes a little bit greater than you had expected? I was wondering to what extent are you guys actually proactively pushing the adoption of Gateway a little bit harder?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP Operations   [43]

Yes, I think if you're looking at the success-based number, clearly we need to convert the analog-tier households before we convert the hub sites. It's the customer portion of the DNU activity that all gets front loaded and so that's a significant component in terms of Q1. We had great success with Gateway in Q1 and so certainly that's a portion of that. I think if you're trying to map out success-based run rate, it certainly comes down as you move through other elements of our plan through this fiscal year. December's a pretty big month for us from a success-based point of view and certainly nothing alarming in what we saw in there and then you'll see success-based come down as we move forward over the next couple of months

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [44]

Got it. No, that's helpful. Should we start to look at Gateway increasingly not just as a retention product, as a product that you will increasingly use to proactively gain customers going forward?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [45]

We've talked an awful lot about our good, better, best approach and our good, better, best approach has not changed and in fact, if anything, it's been reinforced. One of the things that you've seen us do is we've led with best over the course of the last six months, in many instances. It was really about us saying there was a portion of the customer base that believed we were actually behind our primary competitor technologically. Certainly in terms of our market surveys today, that's no longer the perception and part of that is that we put our best products forward in lots of our promotions and other things. I think what you'll see and if you're watching what we've done in the month of January in terms of pricing and packaging, is we've moved the new simple bundles with everyday value, emphasis on our good price points

I think as you look over this period of time, the offers that we have in the marketplace are all driving more to good as opposed to best and we're seeing good success with that. There's absolutely a role for Gateway in the best place and it gives us some wonderful opportunities for win-backs with customers who are clearly unsatisfied, not being able to get multiple streams in the home, clearly unsatisfied with the Internet speeds they're getting from our primary competitor. But I think our primary focus, certainly this month, is in the good space

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [46]

Got it. Okay. Thank you very much

Rob Goff, Northland Capital Partners

 Rob Goff,  Northland Capital Partners Inc. - Analyst   [48]

Could I ask a question on the broadcasting side? Could you discuss how the advertising demand softened within the quarter, whether that has continued on that trajectory going through the quarter or whether there's been a leveling of demand?

Paul  Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President, Shaw Media   [49]

Paul Robertson here, happy to respond. It was a pretty broad-based industry downturn that happened that affected the months between September and December. This quarter was highly affected and those that have more conventional TV tend to get hit more than those with a strong specialty. In fact, our specialty was up nicely to a year ago. As we start the next quarter, it starts soft in December, but then goes back into growth mode starting January, February. We really saw the whole market pick up over the last four weeks, substantially, to a year ago. We feel we're really well-positioned to take advantage of it because our returning programs performed extremely well

At the start of the season, we were maybe a bit light on some of the premiers and some of our programming appeared a little later. We're now in great shape. We also took a lot of cost out to balance out the known shortfall we were going to have on revenue. You see, of course, those cost savings start to appear as the quarters progress. Our sub revenues should show a nice uptick as we go forward, as well, because of the new deals that we're making with the BDUs, leveraging a strong annual increase

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Northland Capital Partners Inc. - Analyst   [50]

Okay. Thank you. Still on the broadcasting side or the content side, can you discuss your most recent announcement on the news front and with the incremental cost maybe associated with that and perhaps if this move foreshadows a greater commitment to content?

Paul  Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President, Shaw Media   [51]

Sure. It's Paul again. I'm sure that everyone picked it up. We announced that we're planning to do a 24-hour all news channel that would come into play sometime during the summer and it was focused on the BC market only. It's significant, but a regional play. The thing about these type of channels, if you go at them sensibly, is that they have a high degree of automation and repurposing of existing content. We have adopted a very sophisticated control group planning software that allows us to move the content elements around in a compelling way without a lot of people having to touch the keys

That's one element. Of course, also, we'll use Chris Gailus newscast and Dawna Friesen, our big stars and some of the newscasts will be the same but in different times of day. We see this as a significant offering to extend our news, but not one that's highly cost intensive. In fact, we think it will be so well-received by the advertising community that we think, on balance, it won't have a significant investment requirement in the early going

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Northland Capital Partners Inc. - Analyst   [52]

 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [54]

Just wondering if you can just discuss the timeline to an all-IP type system? I know Gateway, you talked about last quarter as being more or less a stepping stone, just wondering if we can get an update there? The second question on television just pertains to what you're seeing within the mix. Obviously, some good premium growth in terms of premium channels, PVRs, HDTV, VOD. I'm just wondering how that upsell gets offset by some of your subscribers taking smaller TV packages, obviously in a more a la cart environment going forward? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [55]

Hey, Drew. It's Peter Bissonnette. On the all-IP, really what I think we have a track record of providing infrastructure when it's necessary and the Gateway certainly -- first of all, we have about 1.8 million IP customers already on the Internet side. On the television side of the IP, by having the Gateway product, that provides us with the flexibility, if you will, because the real benefit for IP is in the establishment of guides and being able to do those in an efficient way. With the Gateway product, with the Dream product with Motorola, we have the benefits of that IP and HTML5 look and feel, but we also have within that Gateway still the highest quality distribution for HD signals with our QAM devices. The hybrid Gateway device gives us the IP, continues to give us the best quality in HD, as well as providing, in the future, some DLMA types of features. We don't believe by tearing down what we already have, which is a phenomenal network, that there's actually benefit to our customers. This provides the benefit without the cost

And picking up on the second part of your question, Drew, if you're talking about the a la carte plan and what's happening in terms of premium boxes, we launched Personalizer in the first week of March and we've seen an extraordinary uptake. We're very pleased with the results that we've had from Personalizer. The beauty of it is that customers are able to customize their product offering and the savings that we achieve in network fees, in essence, get passed on to the customer as they move through that process. Personalizer has been a very margin-friendly program for us, so that there's a little bit less revenue, but only marginally less revenue and certainly our costs go down as well

I think our ARPU story is a great story. Our ARPU continues to be up. It was up in every product. I don't think you're seeing a revenue decline. I think in many instances, with our new product offering, we're able to offer some more choices for customers and certainly our HD leadership in the marketplace, having the most HD in the marketplace, is a core competitive advantage for us

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [56]

Okay. That's great. Just a final one on Internet -- I think back in Q3 you alluded to, I think, 1500 subscribers to your highest speeds of Internet. Just wondering if you can update us what the demand is on the very high end and whether the differentiation of that high end within the marketplace is -- just how it's resonating more going forward?

Paul  Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President, Shaw Media   [57]

We have more and more customers moving to higher and higher speeds, just by virtue of the type of video streaming that is becoming just a matter of course. The daily behaviors on Internet now with video streaming and with iPads, is putting clearly a differentiation on our product as opposed to our competitors, as being almost necessary in order to enjoy that experience. Just as when we launched at 1.5 megabits 15 years ago, right now the common denominator is somewhere between 10 and 25 megabits per second which is (inaudible) unheard of speeds and customers are now taking advantage of those

 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [60]

Wanted to ask a question on the guidance and specifically, you make reference to assumptions going into guidance. You talk stable pricing environment on the cable side of the business and you talk stable advertising demand and rates on the advertising or on the media side of the business, just trying to understand the definitions there. We have seen some changes, I'd say in the cable side of things. You saw more promotional activity in the first Q. And then on the advertising side, you did see a dip down on demand for advertising, though Paul recognizes that there's a bit of a bounce-back coming back. Would you say that your assumptions remain intact relative to when you first thought about where your guidance is going, generally speaking?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP and CFO   [61]

Yes, Greg, I would say that in terms of our initial guidance, well let's take broadcasting first. We have seen softness in the first quarter here and as Paul indicated, there seems to be a turnaround. [Irregardless] of that, we've got cost control measures in place that we plan to activate to make sure the earnings are positive in that sector. In terms of cable side, we saw 7% overall EBITDA growth from last year in the first quarter. Our margins were up 1% compared to last year and they were only down 1% compared to the average -- sorry, 1% down -- 1% up from last year's Q1. They were only down 1% from the overall average of last year. ARPU was up in the first quarter by 7%, from CAD105 to CAD112

There's a lot of good news in there when you look at ARPU and retention. In terms of subsidies, I think it's very important, a lot of analysts have written that we've turned the switch back on in subsidies and that is certainly not the case. In our results last year, there were hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies and all of those were baked into the 48.8% margin that we had on cable. In the first part of this year, we've decided to change tactics. A lot of those subsidies you haven't seen in the market before because they've either been online or on offer with customers or direct marketed to customers. What we've done is we've shifted the blend of how we do subsidies, but not necessarily the quantum

I think people are alarmed about seeing the December mass market as if that was a huge change in strategy and it's simply not. It's a change in tactics in terms of how we do it. When you look at the price competition, yes, it continues. People have talked about our offer of CAD100 Visa card for three services as aggressive. But the competitor's giving away a tablet that has a wholesale value of CAD350 and an HD PVR. We need to make sure our tactics are able to keep up with that and we're still confident we'll be able to balance both retention of customers, subscriber growth, particularly in the areas of phone and Internet, which are very high margin areas for us, and that we, at this point, see ourselves delivering positive results in the cable operation and satellite continues to tick along well and we expect it to be positive as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [62]

Thanks for that clarity, Steve. Just a quick follow-on it -- as you move from direct marketing to more mass marketing, do you guys see a risk of customers that were content, before but now seeing kind of like what the wireless guys are going through, are you anticipating or do you think there's a risk of people calling in to the Customer Service center and asking for things they might not have been asking for before?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [63]

Greg, it's Peter. It was interesting, the campaigns that we were actually running, those were open to our existing customers as well and many of those customers actually took advantage of it to move up from a single product to a dual and triple play. I think they appreciated the fact that they were actually included in that and weren't excluded. We understand the phenomenon you're describing and we're very sensitive to that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [64]

Probably something that you're happy with

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [65]

Yes. Just building on that, the vast majority of Visa cards absolutely went to our existing customers in our December 1 to December 23 promotion and they were certainly delighted to receive them during the holiday season. Also, if you look in terms of our promotional offerings, Visa cards came out of the market December 23, we're at six months at CAD19.95 on each of our core products, so that CAD19.95 phone product is a regular price CAD24.95. The TV product is a regular price CAD26. The regular price on the Internet product, bundle, there's a bit more of a discount there, you're probably somewhere around CAD40

These are not massive percentage reductions. In addition to that, important to note that the CAD100 Visa program in mass was accompanied with a three-month offer. While we invested some one-time only costs in December, those customers are going to come into full retail in month four. There's a number of pieces of the thing and I certainly understand the change in tone and I think there is a change in tone, which is we have an extraordinary competitive resolve. Within that change of tone, though, I think the mistake is to equate that change of tone to a change of promotional activity. I think you need to look at all parts of our business including everyday value, including customer care leadership, in terms of technology leadership. But we have 13,000 very, very committed Shaw people who have extraordinary competitive resolve today

 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities/Griffiths McBurney - Analyst   [68]

Hoping to dig into Paul's media comments a little bit. When were the subscription rate increases and what do those equate to on a dollar basis?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [69]

First of all, they kind of phase out. As you imagine, these contracts with the major players have all different end dates. What we've done is set a tone with one of the first deals that we made that set sort of an industry standard and then as others come due, then we look to kind of mimic a similar kind of approach with the rest. It unfolds, I'm going to say, over the next two years in terms of getting all the deals renewed. With respect to the nature of the improvement, we shouldn't get specific about exactly what we're asking and looking for with each one of these BDUs, but just say that it is a significant increase and we feel it will be part of our success over the next five years. But it's, I'm going to say, an annual single digit, strong single digit increase

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities/Griffiths McBurney - Analyst   [70]

Okay. If I look at that single digit increase in subscription rates and you talked about the advertising pickup in Q2, is it too optimistic to assume flat revenue growth over the remainder of the year?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [71]

I think that if you looked at it on the second quarter basis, you can see that the advertising uptick really didn't start to kick in until January. We were still in the doldrums in December. There's that to consider. But, going forward, we're looking for a strong number on sub growth and we don't have a lot of visibility on the add side for the back six months. This bounce-back we're seeing could be real and could be lasting or it could be temporary based on a lot of repeating queasiness that we felt from the European situation which seemed to cause all the unease. I think it's hard for us to really be sure about what's going to happen in the back six, but we sure know we're getting a good lift early in the calendar year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities/Griffiths McBurney - Analyst   [72]

Is there a specific sector in the advertising that is down materially right now or since Q1, the beginning of Q2?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [73]

When it was down, it seemed to be broad-based and when it came back, it seemed to be broad-based. I'm going to say all the food and automotive and retail, the big killers all seemed to move in sync. We didn't see it as a by-sector issue. It just seemed to be an overall advertiser confidence issue that everyone seemed to move in lock step and as it came back, same kind of thing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities/Griffiths McBurney - Analyst   [74]

Okay. And then just the last question, you've done a lot of good work on the cost savings in the last year. Maybe you can quantify where some of those cost savings can be over the remainder of this year that you're looking at? I think Peter talked about being pretty confident that, that will help for your guidance numbers, but maybe you can just give us some insight there? I'm talking on the media side

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul  Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President, Shaw Media   [75]

The media question? Okay. It's Paul back in again. We've been really prudent on the program spend side. We probably kept a fair bit of powder dry as we went into the May screenings and the way we set ourself up for the year, so we've been quite careful there. But also, there's a Company that recently came out of CCAA, the Company's very, very careful with expenditures. We've agreed going forward is that we didn't want to put all those costs straight back in. We've just tried to maintain the same kind of diligence that the group has had developed during those tough times and be prudent where we put any additional investment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter MacDonald,  GMP Securities/Griffiths McBurney - Analyst   [76]

You're not talking about large layoffs or anything where we'd see it on the income statement?

Paul  Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President, Shaw Media   [77]

No, we're not referring to any game plan like that, no

 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [80]

Just wanted to maybe touch base on your Wi-Fi network. You recently started trials of the Wi-Fi network in certain cities in Western Canada. Can you maybe remind us as to when like Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, when are these cities are going to be fully up and running? When should we start to expect some revenue from this deployment? And if you can also provide us level of CapEx that you have spent so far on Wi-Fi?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP Operations   [81]

Certainly. The beauty of a Wi-Fi build that's authenticated to our Internet base is our customers can begin enjoying the Wi-Fi service as we build it. We've turned on all of the spots that we built so far and all of the Wi-Fi zones and we're going to continue to activate the zones as we add to them. You'll see more marketing noise around Wi-Fi as we hit more of our critical mass. The initial trial that we've talked about is in Calgary, Edmonton, and Vancouver. We are offering wickedly fast Wi-Fi speeds in places people congregate, places to try in the Calgary example, the Kensington retail neighborhood, 17th Avenue and the Red Mile is activated, Marda Loop, which is a very popular area. We've had tremendous success with multi-location franchises who want to jump onto our Wi-Fi network and we're getting some breakthrough in terms of commercial areas. We've got deployment like that so far in Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver

We continue to ramp up our activity and I think as we build it, coverage will become certainly much broader. But the experience on the Red Mile and 17th Avenue today or I apologize for the personal experience at the Kensington Pub, it's very, very strong. It's been very, very strong. In terms of capital, we're about -- I'm doing some math in my head. We're probably CAD12 million to CAD15 million in on a cumulative basis and I think Steve talked about a CAD50 million annual number

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [82]

Okay. And when do you expect to hit that milestone, where you start actually publicizing and marketing this product more aggressively across whole regions, which at the end of the day you're hoping to get some revenue benefit from? Apart from the marketing of the product itself, can you give us some dates as to when that is expected?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [83]

This is going to become like knitting. This will be a daily activity of ours which is building the network and making it more and more available to more and more of our customers. Remember, the first benefit of this is going to be reduction in churn and adding value to our current broadband services that we offer which are already very, very compelling in terms of speed. The speeds that we're experiencing right now on the Wi-Fi are four times faster than what you would see on a 4G LTE network. To the extent that our customers are currently paying a lot of money for data services using their 4G LTE services, they will have an option to use our Wi-Fi and reduce their costs which makes us more compelling in terms of reducing churn

That is going to become a way of life for us and spending CAD50 million this year gets us into a meaningful contour, but that's going to continue to grow and grow and grow. Where there's going to be other revenue opportunities, we're looking at all of those. One of them, as you know, is Wi-Fi offloading, spectrum offloading and we think that that's going to become even more compelling as the 4G networks start to collide with each other

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP Operations   [84]

And I think at the end of the day we're certainly very pleased with the response of the local municipalities, the interest they have, how they want to support us. Logistically, there's a few things we have to manage and continue to manage going forward for expectations, but certainly the opportunity's there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP and CFO   [85]

And just on a separate topic, since we're talking about mobility, I just wanted for the benefit of investors listening on the call who may not follow us as closely as the analysts, you're very familiar with this, but the sale of spectrum by all of the major US MSOs and Verizon is a major event. Even Cox, who had launched a wireless service, has since suspended that and sold their spectrum to Verizon. By the way, they sold the spectrum at a 50% profit. But what that means is that our decision not to go into wireless, and there's still some lone voices out there that feel that, that was a mistake. But this is certainly a vindication of that in the sense that a lot of smart guys have looked at this and tried to put business plans together for cable companies to be new entrants into the wireless space and have determined, as we determined, that, that is a very difficult proposition. I just think that's something that maybe hasn't caught the attention of everybody on the call, but something that people should be aware of

Just one follow-up on the Wi-Fi and then I've got an Internet question. Just following on the Wi-Fi discussion, beyond just 4G network offloading, are there other business opportunities on Wi-Fi that you think might give you an advantage?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP Operations   [89]

It'll certainly help our ability to sell services in small and medium enterprises. Wi-Fi is something that they want and something we can certainly provide at (inaudible) cost. There's also the opportunity, if you choose to do this, to make it available to others who are not necessarily Shaw customers. There is a monetization opportunity. I think Cablevision's doing that in New York. There's clearly a market for it. We'll play it out and see where we think the greatest value is. Right now, the greatest value is retention with our broadband base and that's really the primary focus

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Blair Abernethy,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst   [90]

Okay. Great. And then on the Internet side, just wonder if you could give us a little more color on what you see happening, the differences happening on adding 10,000 core Internet customers, but you lost about 6,800 of the standalone and of that remaining 210,000 standalone customers, what kind of actions are you taking to try and retain that base?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP Operations   [91]

I think if you look at the trends that are happening in the marketplace, it's clear that the customer's selecting more and more single provider for their entertainment and communication needs in the home. We report standalone Internet customers so you can see what's happening in terms of the single play Internet base. I think it's fair to say single play everything is at more risk than the other parts of our business and we're certainly seeing fairly dramatic moves from single play to double play, from double play to triple play. That having been said, we love those 210,000 customers. It's not all about video. A customer who's got a 50 megabit Internet service and a nice home phone service with us is paying us CAD90 a month with lots of margin in it. That's an outstanding relationship and we're happy to continue to grow that base as well

 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [94]

If I annualize your first quarter free cash flow, I get to about CAD476 million. Shaw Media has their seasonally strongest quarter normally, in terms of cash flow, in fiscal Q1. Your recent pricing promotions only started in fiscal Q2 and have seemed to have some impact on margins and cash flow. As you suggested, your call center beefing up didn't fully impact this particular quarter. Can you walk us through how you get to CAD550 million on an accelerated run rate during the next three quarters?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP and CFO   [95]

First of all, there was an acceleration in Q1 on CapEx, which will moderate over the next three quarters. I've got the numbers in front of me here, Dvai, and there's a clear line of sight to getting to the CAD550 million. I think you can't just take the Q1 and sort of rule that out

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [96]

Okay. Fair enough. Quick question on the Wi-Fi as well because I'm sure, obviously you know the Cablevision experience a lot better than I, but if I look at the Q2 call last year, they suggested only 20% of their Internet base had ever used their Wi-Fi service. I don't think they've ever charged for their Wi-Fi. It's a 3-year-old strategy and as you know, their [RGU] growth has diminished significantly, in spite of Wi-Fi, during that 3-year period. I'm just wondering what from the Cablevision experience gives you confidence and comfort that this standalone strategy works?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP Operations   [97]

Let me just start. I'm sure everyone's going to have a comment on this one. First of al, they're probably in the most competitive [Vios] Verizon environment in the US and they've done extremely well to retain the broadband customer base. What we know and what they've said publicly is that this has been a very, very compelling retention tool for them. They just completed a full build out, if you will, of the Wi-Fi network and it's a model that others are following as well. It's not just us and them. You probably saw the article in The Wall Street Journal that referred to it as well

Every major cable operator in the US has a Wi-Fi strategy. They're all different based on geographic coverage and whatever. But there's absolutely no question that Wi-Fi is a great retention tool for broadband customers and it's a great offload. Every major carrier in the US is going to use Wi-Fi for offload in one form or another. This isn't a stranded asset in any way, shape or form. This is an integral part of providing both an extension of the broadband network and a means of providing wireless coverage for others as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [98]

I'm not sure if Cablevision has signed up any cellular carriers for Wi-Fi offload. You are a competitor of TELUS, Bell is an ally of TELUS. (inaudible) do they really have strategic interest in helping you?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP Operations   [99]

It's not a question of strategic interest in helping, it's a question of how do you reduce your operating costs when you're building out 4G networks. You probably don't have enough capacity either in terms of cell coverage, tower coverage, or potentially spectrum assets. I don't think the Canadian carriers have reached the point where companies like AT&amp;T and perhaps Verizon are at in terms of SmartPhone utilization. They're all going to need some form of Wi-Fi strategy

They could obviously do it themselves, but in some cases they're going to look for the best provider with the best network. We think that with the kind of coverage that we're building and the kind of quality of services that we're providing, we're going to be in that position. This is just a question of economics, it's not a question of resistance. It's a question of how do I defer my costs and ensure that I still have excellent coverage as a carrier by perhaps offloading or buying services from others

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) First question is from Phillip Huang from UBS. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [2]

Yes, thanks for taking my question, guys. Wanted to ask you about your market strategy. Obviously, one of the bright spots in the quarter was the strong subscriber net adds across the board; however, I believe you've reduced some of the promotional activities and raised prices in March so the quarter had ended and with fewer attractive promotions in the May quarter, I'm just wondering if whether you think this strong subscriber trend that we saw this quarter can be sustained and then I think correspondingly, can we expect a moderate -- more moderate impact to your margin? I think you kind of alluded to that in your remarks saying that your cable OpEx run rates of 450 this quarter is not reflective of future quarters and you expect that to improve?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [3]

Phil, let me maybe answer your question in a different way and I want to kind of go through a little bit for those on the call and just walk through some of the things we've gone through over the last quarter and touch on a couple things. As you know and I've said in my speech, the customer service has always been our core of our business in our key strategic advantage. In the fall we let our customers down. We didn't deliver on our commitments and, of course, we faced some significant disruptions in our customer care centers. This happened for a variety of reasons. I think low staffing levels, we had some customer confusion regarding our DNU initiatives. We had the OTA transition, we had lengthy fulfillment times regarding our Shaw plan personalizer, and we had a variety of other offers we had in the market. So, in 2011 we began to put in the necessary operational resources and strategic investments required to fix the problem

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Unidentified Company Representative,  Shaw Communications Inc   [4]

Phil, if I can build a little bit on what Brad is saying, I think if you look at Q2, it was really about us giving ourselves some space between the lingering effects of our customer service issues that built on top of the environment we were in and so you saw us make the decisions that we made and you know that pricing and promotions are a part of our business. It's a matter of degree and I think if you look at the quarter in the past we were more maybe tactical with our offers, but this time with so much noise in the marketplace and the situation we were in we felt we needed to be more direct in mass to demonstrate to our customers that we really wanted their business and that was the thinking behind really the launch of the Visa gift card program and simple bundles. We had, in January, I think you can see in the numbers looking linearly that that approach worked and we were able to shift the core RGU momentum in our favor in the quarter and that really reflects trying a bunch of things in a short period of time, but by the same token, our financial results that our subscriber activities generated are not acceptable to us

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [5]

And so, Phillip, it's Peter Bissonnette, so really in the sort of long term strategy in March we replaced simple bundles with our new XL offers and there was a lot of excitement around those offers but the XL offers were really positioned so that customers really weren't able to down grade, if you will, and re-price themselves and so it's good value for customers but they are less appealing in terms of enticing them to repackage or down grade. We have created positive momentum and that was one of the challenges we were looking at was that the momentum appeared to be shifting in favor of our competitor and we think now with the focus that we've taken in the call centers so they can take 24 hours a day they can handle any call, so what traditionally was handled up until 6.00 in the evening is now handled 24/7 and the wait times that we're experiencing in September has now diminished to an average of three minutes. We have our call-back feature working absolutely pristinely so that customers don't have to wait for three minutes if they don't want to, that they can get a call back within that three to five minute period. So, the momentum has changed. You've seen the numbers with respect to our customer growth

We continue to believe that our subscriber base represents a long-term profitability of our cable franchise and we need to protect that and that's certainly really what was driving our behavior. We need to protect that for our existing customers and compete for new subscriber opportunities and going forward we're really focused on customer profitability so that's really, if you will, will be our mantra, customer profitability and sustainable growth, so we're confident that with the process that we've taken, what we've put in place in terms of our Company, the long-term profitability and free cash flow profile of our consolidated base of business will be much more in keeping with what you're used to with Shaw

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [6]

Got it. That's very helpful. If I could just follow-up. The other bright spot in the quarter was obviously I guess cable revenues despite all of the attractive promotions maintained mid single digit growth. Just wondering if there might be any delayed impact of revenues from the promotions and whether there was any sort of one-time benefits to revenues in the quarter like maybe business contracts that may be playing into some of the I guess the way that your revenues have been growing but margins have been sort of diluted

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [7]

Well, Phillip, as we said, the simple bundles were very popular with our customers and a lot of them use it as an opportunity to lower their costs, so we have seen declines in monthly revenue and cable over the last couple of months which have leveled out now and we expect those to increase, but we will be below where we expected to be earlier in terms of revenue and that's part of the difference in free cash flow here and really if you look at it would be CAD30 million for the rest of the year lowered revenue just as a result of where we are today on our ongoing recurring revenue base

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [8]

Got it, perfect. Thanks very much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [9]

Thank you. The next question is from Vince Valentini from TD Securities. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest/Waterhouse Securities - Analyst   [10]

Yes, thanks. If I can just clarify that last question first before I ask another one. Am I reading correctly what you're saying that you fixed the call center issues and you restarted sort of the subscriber growth engine with all of the marketing initiatives in the last quarter and now going forward now you have the momentum back you can get by without quite as much unusual marketing expense such as those Visa gift cards and any other unusual promotions you had but because of the call center issues are fixed and you have your momentum back you wouldn't expect subscriber growth to fall off even if you don't spend quite as much on marketing in Q3 and Q4. Is that a fair characterization of what you're trying to say?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [11]

Yes, I think going forward in terms of what we're talking about is discipline improvements, as Jay said, we did a lot of things this quarter to respond to that. We're in good shape in terms of customer service today, back where we need to be and so if there were one-time costs in the quarter, I think people need to understand that because we talk about CAD450 million on a cost base in cable but within that there was about CAD5 million of overtime we were still incurring that won't be in place going forward the next two quarters. There was CAD12 million of additional marketing costs and that was largely surrounding the Visa gift card campaign and also the launch of the XL Network around Super Bowl time and CAD6 million of certain other costs that will come out, so that's about CAD25 million that will come out of the next two quarters in the cable cost base

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest/Waterhouse Securities - Analyst   [12]

Okay, that's great. You basically answered my next question on the recurring call center cost so I'll ask a different one then. The other cost item I guess is programming costs. Is the ramp up you've seen and sort of the run rate we see in Q2, does that not reflect most of the renewals that have happened this year or does that continue to ramp up in future quarters?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [13]

Vince, the ramp up that you saw in the quarter is reflective of sort of the full year activity and most of the increases take place, in our case, generally in January so they are already baked in

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest/Waterhouse Securities - Analyst   [14]

Okay, that's good to know and last one for me, if I can just flip that around for Shaw Media. Have the rate increases that you've achieved from other distributors pretty much been reflected in the Q2 run rate or do you get a ramp up on there?

Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc - President Shaw Media   [15]

Yes, it's Paul here. Only partially reflected so far in the sense that we're seeing the flow through of a couple of the majors, but there's still probably 50% of the distribution base that has yet to be increased that is based on the end of contract terms and how they're staggered, so we expect to continue to see upside momentum on subscriber revenue, saw a nice lift in second quarter and some of those are one-timers but it's a nice backbone of growth for us so for the next few years

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [16]

I just want to add to your question, Vince, but one of the things you asked that Steve answered was on the sustainability of the RGU growth and I don't believe or we don't want to leave you with the impression that the numbers that we achieved this quarter that those are sustainable. It's a cost base associated with that and so it will be somewhat less than that, but the costs that we're seeing with that kind of approach, a more modest approach, will also be reduced

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [17]

I would add, this is Peter, it's fair to say it's probably somewhere between Q1 and Q2 for core RGU growth

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [18]

Absolutely. We feel very confident in that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest/Waterhouse Securities - Analyst   [19]

Okay, that sounds great. I'm not sure if there was a question there, Peter, but I understand what you're saying

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [20]

He's making sure. It was a rhetorical question

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [21]

Thank you. The next question comes from Jeff Fan from Scotia Capital. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [22]

Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple of questions. First, on your dividend with the lower free cash flow now at CAD450 million, the pay out is a little bit higher. Just want to get some comfort on what your thinking is on the dividend at that level and obviously going forward, and then the second question is specifically within the RGU adds on phone, very strong quarter that we are seeing in phone adds. Where is that coming from? Is that residential, is that business, and just sort of wondering what your tactics and what really drove that number for this quarter?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP and CFO   [23]

So, first of all, Jeff, on the dividend, we made the dividend decision based on the higher forecast at the time, but this year we'll pay about CAD415 million in dividends in total of which we've got 25% of our dividend recipients on the [deriv] so our net cash cost is about CAD320 million for the year. Even at CAD415 million compared to CAD450 million [we are at today], we do have some room. We realize it's getting closer but we expect free cash flow to potentially improve in future years and we also understand the importance, I mean we've got a very significant block of dividend investors and the importance of maintaining dividend increases at a moderate pace and hopefully we'll need a position to do that going forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [24]

Jeff, on your question about phone, you can clearly see that we're approaching market share as being measured in terms of what's happening in the core RGU space, so simply what's happening with video subscribers and, of course, phone is a product that we can add both profitably and there's still quite a lot of runway for us there. In answer to your specific question, business is now becoming a significant portion of our internet and phone ads, but it wasn't disproportion in terms of its net gain in Q2, the change in the phone net gain was really on the consumer side of the business

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [25]

So, when you guys talk about the RGU growth being a little bit more moderate in the next quarter or two, is that because of internet and TV and how do you see phone sort of fit into that? Do you see moderating pace on phone as well or do you see that continue to remain pretty strong?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [26]

I think that is dangerous to look at our environment as completely baked. We clearly demonstrated and we know we can add phone at significant numbers and you've seen the kind of numbers we need to add phone and I think if we need to add phone at those kinds of levels in this competitive environment, we have the ability to do that. I'm not sure that's really where we want to end up with 55,000 phone adds. I think you'll see our current strategy would be to do somewhat less than that but, for sure, there is an opportunity for us in the phone market in western Canada that we can choose course and speed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [27]

Okay, thanks a lot

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [28]

Thank you. Our next question comes from Glen Campbell from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [29]

Yes, thanks very much. First, just a couple things I wanted to confirm. From your earlier answers you indicated on the cable revenue side that the revenue run rate would be around CAD30 million lower for the rest of the year, so if I understand that's CAD30 million annualized relative to the Q2 rate or CAD30 million in the balance of this year?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [30]

CAD30 million in the last six months, Glen

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [31]

Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And then on the cost side indicated that CAD25 million would come out of the costs on a recurring basis. Is that CAD25 million a quarter just adding up the previous one-timers? Is that the right way to think aunt about that?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [32]

What I was describing there is the delta between the cost increase in Q2 versus the cost increase in Q1, so in Q1 our cost base was about CAD415 million in cable. We are CAD450 million this time and you should see it around at CAD425 million to CAD420 million level going forward in the next two quarters once you take those one-time items out

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [33]

Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And the other thing I want to confirm, Kojiko Cable yesterday disclosed that they unwound these tax driven limited partnerships which are going to create an ongoing cash tax liability. Do you have anything like that, that investors should be thinking about in their valuation?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [34]

Yes, we do actually. We have a number of limited partnerships and that was reflected in the guidance initially and with this guidance here and really the way they've described that, Glen, to make it easy is we've talked about an effective cash rate of about 28% and that 28% includes the bringing back into income of those partnership deferrals

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [35]

So, that's 28% effective cash tax rate, is that right?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [36]

Right but that includes the partnership deferrals coming back in as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [37]

In the Kojiko disclosure they indicated that there is kind of a ramp and this happens over five years. So, in your case how much -- can you give us a sense of the total cash tax that's payable beyond what would normally be payable over the next --?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [38]

Well, the total cash tax, and that would have started with our guidance of this year over the next five years, will be an additional CAD350 million

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [39]

CAD350 million total, including a chunk this year?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [40]

Yes, but remember you're already accounting for that in the cash tax rate that we're giving to you basically

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [41]

Okay, it's an important question. I just want to make sure I've got it. Your normal rate in your jurisdiction would be around 25%, right?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [42]

That's correct

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [43]

So, a three-point delta is a pretty small number. The CAD350 million you're giving me, is that the delta over normal?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [44]

The CAD350 million is the cumulative amount over the five years but there is a step up in what we describe as 28% for this year, it was including the original first year step up and there will be increasing step up in future years

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [45]

Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And then just the last one. You did try a number of things in the quarter from a marketing point of view. You obviously had a lot of success. What we're now seeing is more normal state I guess, if you will. Can you give us a sense from what, from your point of view, worked really well during the quarter in terms of attracting customers, the Visa, the discounted hardware, the discounted internet?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [46]

Well, I think it was a combination of things, Glen, and I think if you note that there was a perception at some time and this is something that the perception was somehow optic TV was a better technology and I think that it's an interesting contrast as many customers that actually have gone to optic TV have in fact found it not to be the case. Our launch of XO and the XO Network and the kinds of things we're doing with digital network upgrade has really kind of shifted again to a recognition that our network is by far much more robust in speed on the broadband side than what customers who have left have experienced when they've gone over there, and so I think there's more awareness of that particular factor. The pricing that Jay talked about in the XO bundles is still very, very attractive. We've simplified the pricing because that was one of the things we heard in our surveys in Vancouver and we had a large fleet of our employees go to Vancouver to talk to customers. They talked to our customers, Entel's customers and they told us that simplicity is really important in pricing and we think that that's reflected in the numbers as well and, Jay, do you have anything else to add?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP Operations   [47]

Just we appreciate your characterization of our XO bundles is, not to put words in your mouth, but perhaps more disciplined than other approaches. That having been said, taken straight off XO bundles, particularly when combined with easy own, create compelling value for both existing and new customers and we think we're right in the sweet spot there and certainly not sure who your provider is but would love to have you look for what you're paying for your suite of services and compare it to our XO bundle. I think you'll see we have got ourselves a spot that's attractive to customers and really enticing to bring all of their business to Shaw

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [48]

I would agree, your rates are great. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [49]

Thank you. The next question comes from Rob Goff of Byron Capital Markets. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Northland Capital Partners Inc. - Analyst   [50]

Thank you very much for taking the question. My question would be on the business side and there is one of to what extent you may be pursuing larger enterprises or larger businesses and whether or not you see partnerships as accelerating that move, drawing the analogy to what you've done with Xplornet on the DirecTV

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [51]

Rob, it's Brad here. I guess a couple of things on that. One is certainly our focus is on the small/medium size business and there's lots of market there for us as there is actually quite a big market share in the west in the small to medium versus the enterprise side and we believe we have a lot of good opportunities there going forward and absolutely we're going to look at partnerships and business where it makes sense and where we can offer similar products across the country to customers that have multiple locations, so we're doing a lot of the work there and we're actually really quite excited about the opportunity where it sits in front and some of the technology coming at us. As we know, small/medium business are looking at clouds and looking at that and when you look at that speed they need it going up the road, not down the road, and the products we're bringing on certainly allow us from a competitive point of view to facilitate that for the small/medium business, so we're excited about the products and evolvement of them and the opportunity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Northland Capital Partners Inc. - Analyst   [52]

Great, thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [53]

Thank you. The next question comes from Colin Moore from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Colin Moore,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [54]

Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. My question just going back to residential video. Within your comments you mentioned you did see some packaging downgrades. I was wondering if you'd just flush out how much of that might have been related to some of the mass marketing you were doing and maybe how much is related to some of the increased flexibility you have in your packaging and to the extent that XO, I know that's tweaked the personal plan a little bit, the extent you see any changes from that initiative?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [55]

Well, with less down graded than re-pricing, actually, so there were customers taking advantage of becoming triple play customers but at a much more cost effective way for themselves and so on the downside, if you will, the costing had impact but those customers are very, very happy and those are customers that the will be very, very sticky

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Colin Moore,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [56]

Great. So, with some of the new flexibility you have, you're still seeing just a modest downgrade in total programming packages?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [57]

Yes, if you look at the conversions that you see from traditional packaging into personalizer and really XO bundles are just simplified starting points in personalizer, you see a modest decline in terms of revenue and you see a similar decline in terms of network fees as those customers convert over. So, I think we accelerated the path of that in Q2 and I think we are more comfortable with the space that we're now in, in terms of the natural migration and you need to reflect. We're entering a sort of a new phase in our competitive environment and our customers and their customers, by the way, are shopping and so it is important to put your best face forward in terms of our bundled packages and offer flexibility and the customer really is in the driver seat and we want to make sure that every customer understands that there's a spot for them at Shaw

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Colin Moore,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [58]

Great, and just last question on the gateway. You've had the product out in the market now for a couple quarters. Any update you can bring on just functionality in your experience and how that's servicing your high end video customers?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [59]

Yes, the gateway is being in the market for some time now and it is a high-end product and as any new product you're going to have -- there's going to be revisions, if you will, and releases that enhance the features that are available on that so we're at a point now where we feel operationally that the gateway is meeting most of our expectations. We're working very closely with the manufacturer on a couple things like [DLNA] and some of the features that we were hoping would be available sooner but will be still a part of their repair technology road map, but it's still one spot, if you will, for those customers that are looking for a whole long PVR kind of features that it will actually address those. We have some other products that we're work on that we'll be launching shortly that have the look and feel of the internet, that our HTML 5 base that we think will satisfy a large group of our existing customers as they have the capability of transitioning from an older guide to a much more flexible user friendly guide

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Colin Moore,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [60]

Great. Thanks a lot

Operator   [61]

Thank you. Our next question comes from Drew McReynolds from RBC. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [62]

Yes, thanks very much. Just a couple of last ones here. Just wondering, Paul, if you could give us some additional color just in the media business with respect to the breakdown between how conventional is trending and specialty is trending, and a larger question I guess just in terms of recent M&amp;A in the broadcasting space just how that impacts, if at all, Shaw's strategy with respect to owning media assets and just a third one here, if I can squeeze it in. Just on Wi-Fi, can you update what your coverage looks like at the moment? Certainly understand there's a little bit of an arms race out there in terms of distributors trying to cure spots on an exclusive basis, so maybe you can help us understand where Shaw is with respect to that footprint? Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc - President Shaw Media   [63]

Thank you, Drew. This is Paul. I'll kick it off with a discussion about the advertising market. It continues to be jittery as customers respond to the various economic news that's out there. In terms of our performance, and it's probably pretty similar with the market, our specialty television business is growing kind of mid single digits and our portfolio is extremely well positioned in the market and that really will lead our strength in growth as we come into a more positive economic environment

Conventional, it's clearly down from year ago. What happens when the market gets soft, as you've expected, there's a migration by the customers from higher CPM businesses to lower CPM platforms, so there's a kind of natural flow that happens when markets get tight like this towards taking more economical offerings and specialty in digital. So, again, we're dealing in a business that goes up and down with the economic climate but I like our positioning coming out of it given our strength of the specialty portfolio

With respect to the recent M&amp;A client -- climate rather, we've seen the most recent acquisition being applied to CRTC between CTV and Astrill and that certainly increases the competitive stakes for us in the marketplace but, again, we feel very well positioned to compete. Our strength in women demographics and specialty are dynamite and we continue to be very innovative on the digital space and our programming continues and our services on specialty continue to build audiences. If you look at our performance on specialty, all of our top networks have grown audience compared to last year, so we think we're still in a very good position to compete effectively on the program buying and selling side. We seek synergies wherever we can within the broader Shaw organization and there's a lot of them that have been able to capitalize on and continue to look to build on those. Drew, one Wi-Fi we've just started that project, we continue to work on it. It's early days as we continue to build on our plan. So, to give you actually where we have coverage, I know there's a lot of interest certainly at different levels of government and certainly from a small and medium business, so we're going to take those opportunity the and make sure we build the best network possible from early stages and what we've seen to what we've built there's tremendous excitement, but for us it's about execution, about delivering on that so a little early days to tell you exactly the coverage. I think there's probably ways you can find that out but we're going to be disciplined in our approach in a small/medium business and try to get into those areas where we have a lot of customers and potential value and the big spots are certainly interested us because we can create quite a value proposition both with the business side and Wi-Fi and bring those into new opportunities which is exciting on both sides

Thank you. The next question comes from Greg MacDonald from Macquarie. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [66]

Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Question is on wireless. You made an indication that you have no intention on building networks. I don't think that's new. You've commented previously on thoughts for the upcoming 700 spectrum option. I think I'm paraphrasing but I think you've kind of indicated you haven't ruled that out whether you'd be potentially bidding on that. I wonder if anything has changed with respect to the 700 option that you communicate?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [67]

No, I don't think so. I think when you look at a traditional wireless network, you look at what's available in the 700, you look at the rules, where things are at. If there's something there that was certainly more about potential for the business to look at but we've made that decision. We continue to look and see where when necessary and when the quad play does come in what we need to do as a company, what is best for us. We know this is not a growth strategy but more defensive, so we're continuing to look at options and see. We know that eventually our competitor will come and we'll do that and we want to be prepared, so we're hoping and looking at different options but certainly not from a traditional wireless network in building anything

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [68]

Okay. So, is it safe to say then, Brad, the bias is not to bid in the auction but you haven't ruled it out, is that kind of where you stand today?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [69]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [70]

Okay. And then just a quick follow on that. Has anything changed on the input to what your thoughts are for wireless, whether that be -- I know it's early days but thoughts on potential traction or business models for Wi-Fi, cost of wholesale access, things have changed recently in that part of the business for actual mobile? Has anything changed that might change your mind on the attractiveness of an [MB&amp;O] deal?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [71]

Well, Greg, a couple thins have changed. One of them is the Wi-Fi strategy has been widely vindicated and supported and confirmed by virtually every carrier that's in the business, so everyone is going to want to do something with respect to Wi-Fi whether it's actually building out a network or offloading on to high quality Wi-Fi networks which is precisely what we're trying to build. As Brad pointed out, we're trying to keep our options open with respect to wireless. We see it largely as a defensive tool and MB&amp;O would not be our preference for the simple reason that MB&amp;O is complicated, costly and doesn't really deliver anything because you don't have control of the product, but we're going to remain relatively open in terms of other wireless-type packaging options that might come our way because we want to be mindful of the fact that competitors will be offering quad play and we have to be in a position where we can at least offer a quad play as defensive strategy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [72]

Michael, for timing on things like data offload, just the conventional wisdom out there is kind of 2014 at the earliest, maybe more like '15. Canadian carriers tend to have a lot of spectrum so the bias might be toward just building out more on the macro networks. What do you think of that? You think that there's a good opportunity to monetize Wi-Fi from a data offload perspective before the '14 or '15 timeline?

Michael D'Avella,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, Planning   [73]

Well, I think you're right about the fact they are going to build out as much network as they can with the spectrum that they've got, but they are very quickly going to run out of spectrum as they start -- as consumers start using a lot more spectrum for high capacity service like video, for example. What we discovered and I think I've seen this as well that whenever you can provide high quality Wi-Fi, that's where customers want to go, especially with things like tablets which are not really mobile network devices anymore. Nomadic devises that you use pretty much in fixed locations so there's a role here for Wi-Fi. The monetization in the offload part of the business is yet to really be defined but we think that if we build a high quality network with good coverage, there's definitely an offload opportunity. It might be in that two to three year time frame but that's probably what we're looking at in terms of construction of a good quality network in any event

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [74]

Thank you. The next question comes from Maher Yaghi from Desjardins Capital Markets. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [77]

Yes, thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to touch base on your capital spending program specifically with your digital network upgrade. In the last two quarters and last quarter of last year we've seen pressure on cash flow coming directly from this network upgrade. Can you just maybe tell us how far are we into this upgrade cycle and looking at your outlook for the rest of the year it seems there's still some spending to go. Can you maybe talk a little bit further down the road how far are we through this upgrade just to give us some metrics as to your spending plans. And my second question is relating to your strong subscriber numbers on the telephony side. Was there something particular happening there or was there any one-time big contract wins that helped you get that number or this was due to specific promotional activities because it was a very strong number. We're trying to understand how, if you can replicate it?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP and CFO   [78]

Yes, so let's start with your capital question. So, the digital network upgrade has the two components that we talked to you about before. There's the customer component and then there's the centralized component that exists in the hub site. The centralized component that exists in the hub site looks and feels a lot like internet network feeling and a good portion of that is baked into our ongoing capital numbers. The customer conversion is all front ended, and so I think if you look at our digital customers over the course of the last three quarters you can read through that in terms of the activity and certainly if you look at the success base as we go through you can read through that, so we're well on our way in terms of the customer conversion and we invested a significant portion of our network conversion at this point. So, if you look at our capital for the year in cable we're certainly in a situation, and you can do the math, where we spent more than 50% of our capital in the first six months, so you'll see capital come down in the next six months primarily in the two key categories, the success base and upgrades and enhancements

On your question of subscriber numbers though, on the phone there was nothing in terms of a contract win that affected those numbers in a big way, although we're excited there may be a few of those that you've seen us announce that will come forward in future quarters. We have -- I think you've seen a shift in focus here which is we have tremendous opportunity in the phone business and I think it's fair to say that we were playing defense and we played a little bit of offense this quarter and our phone product is an extraordinary product that creates great value. You have the opportunity to move customers into a triple play so while our revenue is increasing, their total household bill is dropping and that's what we saw in this quarter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [79]

Okay, thank you that's very helpful

Thank you. The next question comes from Blair Abernethy from Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Blair Abernethy,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst   [81]

Thanks very much. Just wondering if we can get a little bit more color on the business market, in particular. Where are you at in terms of ramping up your efforts here and do you have intentions to work with more partners, more channel partners to help drive your efforts there?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [82]

Blair, it's Peter Bissonnette. Clearly, business is one of those opportunities that we're now starting to take advantage of and we have a great guy, [John Pierce], running our business product and we're looking at sort of four different levels of business starting from we'll call it a cable over coaxial customer base small business. We have a next level which is a little more sophisticated than that, sort of 20 employees and more and then all the way up to the larger enterprises, and we are focusing right now on the bottom two parts of that triangle and we looked at the market, we looked at what we need to do in terms of reach and extending our facilities into those offices that exist in areas that may not be available now and so there's a tremendous amount of focus on that business. It's a CAD6 billion business in the west and when we look at our current market share you'll see us looking like the new entrants and we'll look at ways that we can move many of those customers over to ourselves in a manageable way and a good, manageable growth over the next three or four years looks really healthy for us in terms of the ultimate outcome

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions)

Our first question comes from Phillip Huang from USB. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [2]

First, I just wanted to clarify. Were there one-time type of drivers that impacted your Internet subscriber loss this quarter, aside from your pullback of promos and also the ongoing competitive intensity. And then I have a follow-up

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP - Operations   [3]

Phillip, it's Jay. I don't think there's anything that you would consider to be a one-time driver on the Internet numbers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [4]

Okay

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [5]

Yes, I think, Philip, it just goes to our focus and our disciplined approach to the market and it's reflective. As we said, we're focused on the long term and this is not a chase for numbers to the quarter end, and everything we're doing is tactically in regards to creating long-term value, and maintaining our base, so I think you're somewhat seeing that, reflective in that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP - Operations   [6]

Just building on what Brad's saying, I think to the extent there is a one-time, there likely was a pull-forward in Q2 of that, just with the level of aggressiveness that we had in our offers in Q2, and I think you've probably seen some of that happen there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [7]

Right, okay. And it looks like you are starting to use more pricing promotions beginning in June, to protect your cable subscriber market share. I believe this has already triggered a competitive response from Telus in terms of win-back offers. My concern is that things could spiral into a price war, which obviously would be a lose-lose situation, that you would be impacted a little bit more than Telus given the mix of the business. Just wondering how you think about such risks in your marketing promotions decisions, also, how we should think about any potential impact on margins from these new promos, if at all? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [8]

Philip, I'll start and maybe Jay will add something. I think you look at it and you look at it over the last six or seven quarters, there's always been a tendency at the end of the quarter for a push, and I think it's no similar to what we're seeing from Telus right now, and their push to the end of the quarter. So I don't think it's anything out of the normal. But we've been, as you talk about, the promotions and in the market, we've been very disciplined in that regard and I think in that -- and the benefit of that is showing where the numbers are

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP - Operations   [9]

If we can build on that again, thank you for the questions. Certainly if you look at a macro level at our financial results and subscriber numbers released today, it's pretty good evidence that we weren't overly aggressive in Q3, and if you look, I can tell you June is telling a similar story with everything we see in terms of our financials, revenue and customer story. So we certainly understand the narrative that we did some targeted promotions at the end of the quarter, and our primary competitors responded with some aggressive promotions at the end of their quarter, but it's -- as we move through the summer, we're removing aggressive targeted offers for the marketplace. We're focused both in mass and in targeted offers, as Brad said, prudent, disciplined and sustainable customer profitability

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [10]

Only thing I would add to that, is you do see some signs of pricing changing for Telus, but the promotions are still aggressive in doing that, and there is positive signs in the right direction. But listen, it's a highly competitive environment and will continue to be that way, and we're going to operate in a certain fashion

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So I guess, just to clarify, by your focus on long-term profitability of the assets, obviously market share, maintaining your market share in the near term is still obviously very important to you guys

Thank you. The next question comes from Vince Valentini from TD Securities. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest/Waterhouse Securities - Analyst   [15]

Wondering, there's only a couple months left in this fiscal year, if you can give us any preliminary outlook into CapEx for next year with the DNU and Wi-Fi, and anything else you may be moving on with set-top box subsidies. Do you expect any change of note in your capital spending, or pretty much similar to what we're seeing this year?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [16]

I'd say for next year, Vince, that you'll see a CapEx intensity ratio that will be roughly the same as this year. There are a number of strategic initiatives like the Wi-Fi build, the completion of DNU, we've got some infrastructure that we've got under construction. We've got technology transformation, that's important for flexibility and going forward in our business, to be able to respond, and so those things will carry through into next year and -- we don't see it moderating to a great degree next year. For 2014, it's really too early to comment

Thank you. The next question comes from Jeff Fan from Scotia Capital. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [19]

I want to go back to the Internet response. Brad, you alluded earlier that you believe there's a network advantage here for Shaw on the broadband side. So what happened in the quarter, like are we not -- can we not try to take advantage of some of those advantages to drive that Internet numbers higher? I understand you guys were certainly very disciplined in the quarter, you didn't want to go through pricing. But what about from a marketing standpoint, and driving that advantage further to show some better Internet subscriber trends?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [20]

Yes. I'll say a couple things and maybe the guys will add in. I think we were certainly seeing a lot of activity as customers move up in Internet packages, so we're very pleased with that. We're very pleased that we continue to see our ARPU move up and will in the future, because as we look at even pricing Western Canada, Eastern Canada, there's certainly some significant differences. As you mentioned, Jeff, it is creating long-term value in that focus, and I think when you look at some of the key initiatives as we continue to roll out, we've really done very little on Wi-Fi, promotion and marketing. The DNU is still in process in doing that. We've taken the initiative that bandwidth and data usage will catch up with us and you can certainly see that and where that's going

But ultimately we certainly know how important broadband is in the bundle, and how being the highest margin for us we believe that we get Wi-Fi, it helps churn, gives us pricing power, and let alone some of the other advantages of Wi-Fi. But we certainly think it's the right approach, but as we've said before it's maintaining the base and focusing on that, and as we get these projects, get fully flushed out and I guess fully built out we can really allow ourselves to see those advantages more often. The one thing I would also say is, when you look at the US and as pricing has come up from a competitive point of view in the broadband world, there has tended to be a choice, a consumer choice now of what you're picking versus over price, and cable has tended to be that choice in the US. So, early indication and certainly from a product base of what cable offers, and our infrastructure advantage is something that we're going to continue to build on and continue to focus on, and what we're doing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [21]

Can you give us a little bit of some color on the breakdown of your Internet subscribers into some of the key buckets, maybe higher tiers versus lower tier speeds, just to give us a starting point as to where you are?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP - Operations   [22]

We've never really been keen on doing that because for competitive reasons as you can well imagine. But what we're experiencing is moving from light services to higher speed services is having a positive impact on the ARPU of our Internet services, and so that is a fact. But other than throwing the pie, our customers are clearly moving up to a much more compelling Internet service, and I think the Wi-Fi will also solidify that trend

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [23]

Okay. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [24]

Thank you. The next question comes from Glen Campbell from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [25]

You did a little better on the revenue line in cable than you had indicated last quarter, so it seems like there was maybe less reprice pressure reflected in this quarter's numbers than we'd been expecting. Could you talk a little about how much sort of late reprice risk there might be based on your current tariffs? In other words, if people were to move on to current pricing how much of a revenue hit could there be relative to the current run rate

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [26]

I think it's fair to say we were pleased as the quarter unfolded that revenue did come in a little bit higher than we thought it was coming in, and after some successive months of revenue declines, we're certainly much more enjoying successive months of revenue inclines. We think the pricing structure is in good shape. We think the disciplined and prudent approach that we're taking is showing excellent results from ARPU. Our EXO bundles have been great in acquisition, and aren't causing repricing in the base. So there's clearly no hockey stick in the cable revenue line, but I think we're pretty confident with this stable, steady trend that we've seen in the last couple months

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [27]

So just to clarify, you're not seeing sort of a flow of customers calling in and adjusting their packaging in a way that would bring revenue down for those customers?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [28]

No. We're seeing a really nice trend

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [29]

Okay. That's great. My follow-up was on service contracts. You've been pretty firm in not using them. Your competitor clearly does. You used the hardware contracts instead. Can you talk about the reasons for not going down the service contract road, and whether you might reconsider that position?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [30]

Well, there's arguments for contracts, as you -- I guess it's really what does the contract do. As you said, we have equipment and easy-own program certainly is a very consumer-friendly plan because customers are getting something and they're agreeing to pay for it over time and that creates kind of a natural kind of relationship. What we don't want to have happen is having customers who are feeling confined by a contract, who otherwise would like to do something else. We don't think that's consumer-friendly, and so we're looking at ways that we have more consumer-friendly kind of relationships, but that still create some kind of a longer term relationship that you can count on. But we don't want to have the ball and chain kind of contracts that others have adopted

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [31]

To paraphrase, you are looking at options there, there might be contracts but you don't want to go down -- we might see changes, but not the traditional lock in over three years, let's say

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [32]

It's Peter. From a customer point of view, but also the nature of contracts, there needs to be an enticement to get a customer to sign a contract. That enticement tends to be what we've seen in the market which is fairly significant give-aways of hardware and other devices to be able to accept that. That has an impact on your cost of acquisition, and we're trying to manage that. As Peter said, our easy own program is a very customer-friendly way for people to come on and make a commitment to us and at the end of the period they own their equipment, they haven't had to pay up front, and so it's a nice way to manage that without being --

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [33]

Heavy-handed

Thank you. The next question comes from Rob Goff of Byron Capital Markets. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Northland Capital Partners Inc. - Analyst   [37]

Thank you very much. You mentioned in your release the first store in Calgary. Is this part of a more ambitious program of introducing more retail points of presence?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [38]

Rob, I'd say we're slowly increasing our points of presence, but there's no big strategy here to open hundreds of stores. We just feel we need more presence in the communities we serve, and so we're taking an approach where we're mainly focused on the big centers right now, but nothing to the numbers that would be significant

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Northland Capital Partners Inc. - Analyst   [39]

Okay. Thank you. If I could dive back into the pricing questions, but with a bit of a different twist. We tend to talk about promotions quite a bit. Could you talk about the pricing environment for the established base or for the legacy subscribers?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [40]

Sure. As I mentioned before, we've seen some positive signs recently the beginning of May, where Telus has increased different -- pretty well most of their wire line products I would think in different degrees, so certainly a positive sign. But as I mentioned, they're still very aggressive on the promotions, and continue to be that way, but we take it as certainly a more disciplined approach in some way

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [41]

As Brad said, indicated, pricing in the east is fairly greater than in the west. We still believe we have some good pricing power when discipline really comes back into this market

 Rob Goff,  Northland Capital Partners Inc. - Analyst   [42]

Thank you. The next question comes from Drew McReynolds from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [44]

Yes, thanks very much. Good afternoon. Just two questions. First, a follow-up on the Internet side. Noticed positive net adds of standalone Internet subs in the quarter, seems to be maybe a little bit of seasonality because there was positive last Q3, so just wondering if that is the case and if so, why. Alternatively, maybe you can put the positive net adds within the context of overall losses on Internet. And then just a second question on satellite, if I can. You seem to have certainly a lot of interesting initiatives under way with Xplorenet and VOD, and of course, the new satellite coming on-stream. Just wondering when you look into fiscal 2013, do you expect this to -- these initiatives to primary be retention-driven, or do you expect a little bit more on the revenue and subscriber growth side? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP - Operations   [45]

Okay, Drew. Jay again. We'll take the Internet question. Yes, I mean, we've certainly seen some positive net adds in terms of Internet standalone. I'm not sure it's enough to declare a seasonal trend

I think one of the things that is clear is we're absolutely open for business for customers who want to take Internet and Internet and phone from us without video. And in the past, our pricing packages have not necessarily been favorable to that. So to the extent that we're growing Internet and voice customer, great margin customer, delighted to have them, and so you may see some of that. I recognize that it kind of goes against some of the forces with the bundle and the triple play, so it's hard to see how that balance will go, but we're certainly pleased with the positive result in that area

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [46]

We've also seen positive adds in the business as well, in the Internet space

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Cummins,  Shaw Communications Inc - GVP - Shaw Satellite Operations   [47]

Drew, it's Jim. The team has been really busy, and we certainly enjoy the partnership that we established with Xplorenet and a lot of the features that we launched is really -- number one is retention of the base. These are services that customers are asking for. You can imagine in a rural market, things like full streaming VOD, have access to the great content that Shaw has, whether it's free content on there or new content or the library of content, it's pretty compelling in a rural market. So we look at it a as retention first, and certainly over time once we get these things rolling and in place, it's a pretty compelling offer that we can take anywhere in Canada with now not just video but we also have an Internet partnership, which is what customers are asking for. Then you throw on VOD and some of the services as we move forward with HD Guide and then new G1 satellite, which brings a lot of HD content and other pay-per-view content directly to our customer's home. Certainly in a rural market, I think over time it's certainly going to help our growth financially but certainly on the retention side, customers are going to be satisfied, and we'll just keep providing that great customer service experience

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [48]

And if I can just have a follow-up there, Jim, that's great. From a CapEx perspective, obviously acknowledging launching satellite is lumpy, but overall, is there any changing dynamic in terms of the free cash flow of the business?

Jim Cummins,  Shaw Communications Inc - GVP - Shaw Satellite Operations   [49]

Well, there's a couple -- when you launch a new satellite there's certainly a couple one-time financial hits there. And the groundwork that it takes. I think our team has done an incredible job preparing for the launch of this, and they've got the [three locale and visa out there, which is positive, and they can't pay for receivers,] and connecting broadband is certainly really positive so at the end of the day there is a cost associated to that but we certainly have planned and have it covered

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [50]

Thank you. The next question comes from Greg MacDonald from Macquarie Securities. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [52]

Wondering if you could remind us of the build out plan for the Wi-Fi networks. I'm not asking for commercial roll-out schedule, I know you're not going to tell me that but I'm thinking more in lines of readiness for commerciality, in other words, when are you able to mass market that network as a differentiator for your broadband product?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [53]

Greg, just a couple things. We're early stages. We're building out. We're working on scaling and doing a variety of things, working in a variety of verticals, I would say across Western Canada. We're working with a variety of municipalities on getting access and doing that. So all those things are in play. So I think as we go along here, you're going to continue to see us scale and as we hit the fall and early in the new year, we'll start to promote that. But this is a multi-year commitment, a multi-year build and some of those factors will depend on how well we can get in there and how fast, and in doing that, so you have some flex in that regard. But three years out, we certainly -- two to three years, as we go in here, will start to give us substantial coverage and you'll see us promote from there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [54]

Brad, just a quick follow-up on that. Is part of the readiness for commerciality a function of things like the ability to hand off from one cell site to another or is general coverage for rudimentary Wi-Fi service for tablets, is that good enough to get you in the game?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [55]

It's a mesh network we're launching so every point hands off to the other one, in a Cisco network. What you said, coverage is really the key and ensuring we get in those spots where lots of people congregate, and then from there we go to the businesses which we're doing. So we feel we have the right approach and in doing that and it's as simple as providing that service and those speeds that emulates the home

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [56]

Just a final question. Are you aware -- I've followed what's been going on in the US. There are opportunities that you guys probably see that are more than what we see. Are there any situations in the US where this type of service add-on as a product is having a material impact on subscriber growth?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [57]

I think you're seeing -- you look in the US. They're just starting, the consortium has been joined down there. I think Cablevision has been a leader there. I think you know what position they're in. I think they've certainly seen the benefits. They're in a maturing spot, also. But with that consortium, we're really excited because we really think as we participate in that, that our customers would love to roam free in Western United States and have that opportunity just as some of the US cable people coming up here or customers have that opportunity. So early days, we're working through all those things and that type of thing, but it's part of our focus to ensure that we have a Wi-Fi roaming agreement across North America

 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [58]

Operator   [59]

Thank you. The next question comes from [Matt McMahon] from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matt McMahon,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst   [60]

Two, if I could. One on the cable side. If you can help us think through how much of the sequential pressure in cable RGU volumes this quarter was driven by weaker gross adds versus higher churn, and then secondly, on the media side you talked about advertising pressure in the quarter, specifically on the conventional side. Can you give us some more color on which verticals you saw driving the pressure, and whether you've seen any real change in trends thus far in June. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP - Operations   [61]

Sure. Matt, it's Jay. I'll take the first one. Certainly, the difference in our RGU trend is in the gross add area. And I think, as you've heard from our comments, it's by design. We haven't seen a material uptake in churn

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc - President - Shaw Media   [62]

It's Paul here. On the ad side, we saw -- we did see some variation between the verticals, but I can't say that there were any dramatic trends there. What we do know is that we're up against some pretty tough year-ago comps in the quarter. In fact, it was -- there was a federal election that drove a lot of the party spending in the year-ago numbers, and that tends to go to conventional. So I think as you compare year over year, it was a more challenging quarter for the industry as it related to conventional television. Perhaps the change in trend was just a bit more, related to what it was up against a year ago

In terms of the outlook, we don't know much more than our own pacing at this stage, and what we're seeing is continued strength on the specialty side, and on the conventional side, we've kind of seen an uptick over the last five or six weeks. So we expect the summer to show probably a similar trend to what we've seen on the year, which is growth on specialty and some decline on conventional. And so I guess expect more of the same in the fourth quarter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matt McMahon,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst   [63]

Thanks for that color

Operator   [64]

Thank you. The next question comes from Maher Yaghi from Desjardins Capital Markets. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [65]

I just wanted to ask you about your TV everywhere initiative. Can you give us a status on the deployment, your initial view on its impact on your customer churn, and any revenue upside that you could get from it?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP - Operations   [66]

Our TV everywhere initiative is under active development. We're going to take an approach that essentially seeks to provide value to our customers. It will be an authenticated approach in the sense they have to have a subscription to cable obviously, and subscription to the channel that provides a certain level of content. It will vary depending on which programming service is being offered. Rights are being acquired for example across the board with broadband and tablets and other mobile devices or other types of smartphones, whatever the customer wants. Our success to date in terms of providing on-demand services demonstrates the value of having, for example, the global TV series available pretty much 24 hours after they've aired, TV series or whatever. There's clearly value there from the customer point of view. I don't think we're going to do anything here that creates a massive competitor, if you will, to the established TV ecosystem that protects the revenue streams of the VDUs as well as the revenue streams of the programs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [67]

Can you comment a little bit about the churn, are you seeing any impact on churn for customers that are using the service?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP - Operations   [68]

Well, what we can say is it's very, very effective retention tool. When you offer customers Broadband Access or HD content, whether it's over the set top of over a broadband connection, to premium movie services whether they're HBO services or Movie Central or whatever, or even some of the more common services that we carry like History Television, not that History Television is a common service, it's an outstanding service. Yes, it has tremendous value. Customers use it. The consumption of VOD, of free VOD that's related to a specific service and authenticated through the VDU has great retention value. We've it for years

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Cummins,  Shaw Communications Inc - GVP - Shaw Satellite Operations   [69]

When we talk about some of the new features that we're going to be launching that Jay mentioned on Dream Gallery, that effectively, because it's backward compatible to all 700,000 boxes, that effectively provides them with a network PBR capability, and just VOD provides the storage if you will of those I'll call them prime time programming, and so that clearly would provide a degree of retention as well

 Bob Bek with CIBC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [2]

Just a question on the competitive environment. You had the opportunity to put through some price increases. We've seen the benefit flow through on the cable side. Can you talk first of all any customer response to those increases and secondly what, if any, competitive response you are seeing in those markets? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [3]

Well, Bob, I'll just start, maybe Jay will add in. We certainly maintain that discipline and focus and we have seen some rates move up from our competitor in Western Canada. And I know we've adjusted some rates, too. Jay, can you give us some highlights there?

Jay  Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP Operations   [4]

Yes. I think, Bob, in general terms we're seeing encouraging signs in the marketplace. I think you've seen us make some adjustments to grandfather packages and some adjustments to some of our Internet packages September 1 and TV packages in its early days, but I think we would characterize the competitive environment as encouraging. In terms of the response, we're delighted with the exceptional customer experience approach that we're taking in the business and our call center metrics have never been better along with our other customer service metrics, so it is certainly our view that the exceptional customer experience is the key to reducing churn and ultimately pricing power

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [5]

Just to follow on those comments. I know you had customer service issues in the past. Is it fair to say you've got that all behind you and things are running smoothly?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [6]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [7]

Okay and just the last model question I guess if I could before I pass it on. Steve, cash taxes. I know you talk about the higher cash taxes into free cash. Any ballpark or update on ballpark you can give us to work with for 2013?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP and CFO   [8]

Yes, so, over a five-year period of time we are repaying the tax benefit the partnership deferrals

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [9]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP and CFO   [10]

And when you factor that in next year, Bob, there are some other things going on in terms of some loss that will be able to utilize. The best way to look at it is an overall rate of 30% --

Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [11]

Okay

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP and CFO   [12]

-- for modeling purposes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [13]

And then, Bob, just as a follow-up on the first. We maintain our disciplined approach in the market and that will continue in fiscal '13, but you could certainly say that from a new acquisition and promotional activity is still very active in the west

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [14]

Vince Valentini with TD Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest/Waterhouse Securities - Analyst   [16]

Maybe I can start with the [SIMI] market, maybe the progress you're getting there. And we look at the Internet and telephony numbers you put up here in the fourth quarter maybe you can try and parse that a little bit for us of how much that success is business customers versus residential?

Jay  Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP Operations   [17]

Hello, Vince, it is Jay. I think it's fair to say that we continue to see solid growth in the business market and it's also fair to say that it's driven primarily through small business. We haven't released net subscriber breakdowns on business. It's certainly fair to say that our Internet and phone gains are meaningful, in terms of the business gains, and we think we still got absolutely solid growth opportunities in fiscal '13 and small and then some opportunities in some of the other segments

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest/Waterhouse Securities - Analyst   [18]

Jay, would they be meaningful enough that the Internet subs you put up could actually be negative in residential to correspond with the negative on basic video? Because [tele] certainly claims when they when a video customer, 90% or 95% of the time they get the broadband as well. So, it's little inconsistent with that differing correct three of your Internet subs versus your video subs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay  Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP Operations   [19]

Marginal. You're going to box us in to actually answering the question? The -- your general assumptions are not flawed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest/Waterhouse Securities - Analyst   [20]

Okay. A follow-up then, totally different topic. Your free cash flow given about 7% above your guidance and you're expected to stay there in 2013. So, can you give us any thoughts on what that read through is maybe for the dividend growth this year? Does that mean there is room for a 5% to 7% dividend increase to keep the payout ratio basically the same?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [21]

Yes, Vince, a couple things. We certainly know how important it is to our investors and our yield investors on dividend and dividend growth. Talking with the Board, we'll be reviewing that the next quarterly meeting and making a decision then

Phillip Huang, UBS

 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [24]

Was wondering if you could expand a little bit on your cost initiatives. As you know, cost reduction has been a huge focus for some of your peers and your operating income for amortization beat expectations this quarter partly helped by lower cost, but was wondering if maybe you can give us your thoughts on any broader cost initiatives for fiscal 2013?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [25]

Sure, we're certainly continuing to focus on all of our opportunities in terms of efficiency. We talked on a number of calls ago about some work that we are doing on the supply chain part of our business in terms of procurement, in terms of renegotiating and negotiating deals with our strategic vendors, in terms of reverse logistics. And I think we've really completed that phase, and you can see the effect of that phase as the read through in to our results. As we move into the next phase, we've got a multi-year approach, and we are going to continue to have a laser light focus on costs in all parts of our business

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay  Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP Operations   [26]

Yes, and I think on top of that it's simplifying the front-end packaging. Bundling for the customer really drives lower calls into the call center as we call it activity multipliers then you spit out a whole bunch of service calls, so we're really trying from end to end to simplify the business for the customer and get rid of those multipliers within the business as another example of some of the opportunities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [27]

Right. Got it. And then just quickly touch on WiFi. Can you maybe give us an update on your strategy there? Assuming that the WiFi project costs you in aggregate roughly CAD200 million and maybe give us an update on how much you've spent in 2012 and how much you expect to be part of CapEx for fiscal 2013?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [28]

Just a couple of things on that. One, we're trying to build a WiFi to where the people are. So, we're really building it to when that activity is, so it's pretty hard for us to determine what that price is and that cost when you look at it. Going forward, I think for us our focus right now is access and coverage and continues to be. We've had good success with some of the businesses we had on in putting the WiFi up and we had a reasonable number of WiFi spots and hot spots there. But for us we really want to make sure we build the coverage because it creates great value for our customer base and it's something that right now is the focus going forward

 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [31]

When Bell first announced that they were going to buy by Astro, I guess the investment community sort of automatically assumed that Shaw would take in course one day. Now, with the CRTC decision last week, I'm just wondering if you can update us on some of your thoughts around that decision and how you see that? Whether the commission is basically sending the message that they don't want to see anymore vertical deals or whether it impacts horizontal deals and how you guys see that going forward?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [32]

Sure, a couple things. Just on course, we have a variety of activities going on. Shaw is pretty focused on the things are we need to do. Overall, we're really pleased with how the media division has performed and the benefits of that. And we're -- we realize there is some value and some synergies there, but strategically if the family feels it's right and it's the right time to do it, we'll look at it. I guess what I'll say in light of the decision last week, when you look at it and it's -- everyone kind of has their opinion, but I believe there was -- seemed to be somewhat more of a Bell-focus decision when you look at not so much against VI in the industry and some of the I think the size we're dealing with. And I believe Bell has some options and what they need to look at, but it seemed to me when you read into it, it seemed to be some of the things that Bell was dealing with that's more specific than from an industry point of view

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [33]

Is there anything that would prevent Shaw Communications putting Shaw Media into course?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [34]

Yes, yes that might be myself. No, -- well, you look at it because content I think is fundamental to the business and the things we're seeing and the value we created and keeping costs down let alone some of the opportunities and new innovation and products coming is a real benefit. And I have a -- unless you can secure yourself and see something there that you could really be comfortable with, it would be very difficult to look at that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jean Brazaeu,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP Regulatory   [35]

Jeff, Jean. Just on the regulatory front, I'm not sure if that was part of your question. We would look at a transaction like that as an amalgamation. Both assets would be owned by the family and, therefore, there would be no change in control. So, on the regulatory front we wouldn't see any real issues there

Glen Campbell with Bank of America

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [38]

I had a question on your revenues on the cable side which were pretty strong in the quarter. So, there's I guess a dynamic we can't see directly which is discounting. You've got people going on to discounts and you got people coming off them. Could you talk a little bit about how that worked during the quarter? Did you have more -- was the strength in ARPU, if you will, a function of people rolling off or less people coming on? Could you give us a bit of color on that?

Jay  Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP Operations   [39]

Yes, Glen, it is Jay. For sure. Our focus is absolutely on growing our subscription revenue base and we are really pleased with the signs that we're seeing on that side and that is not just about net subscriber gain. So, if you think about the key drivers being reduced, churn, upward package migration, some rate increases, and net subscriber gains, I think it gives you a better context of that going forward. So, you've seen some increase in ARPU through absolutely upward pathway migrations on the Internet and that's a nice part of the story. Certainly, rate increases are a nice part of the story. And with the focus that Brad talked about in terms of customer profitability, you really can't read that through our subscriber numbers. You can't replace CAD160 customer even with eight CAD20 customers, and so I think you'll see that as we continue to see increases in our subscription revenue base

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [40]

Okay. Thanks. And then a follow-up on CapEx. You itemized some of the special projects you've got planned for 2013. Could you give us a sense of how many dollars are attached to those projects, either individually or all together?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP and CFO   [41]

Well, I think -- let me just speak generally to the -- we talk about a marginal decline in terms of capital projects. In the satellite area we've got the final payment on the Anik G1 launch which is about CAD25 million to be paid early in the year, and then on the cable side a big reduction group coming down in DNU, so we've spent about CAD90 million so far in DNU and we're progressing very well and for next year we would see that number dropping down substantially. So, that really accounts for most of the client in the cable CapEx

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [42]

That's great. And then I guess the other special item would be WiFi. Can you give us a ballpark on what that was last year or might be in '13?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [43]

So, WiFi to date we've spent CAD25 million and we are looking at about the same run rate for next year

 Rob Goff,  Northland Capital Partners Inc. - Analyst   [46]

I have two follow-ups. The first one would be from a policy perspective. If course would be an amalgamation, I take it that would suggest there would be no net benefits required?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [47]

We -- our position would be that there would be no change in control and the benefits applies to situations where there are changes of control. So, I guess that would be certainly our position that no benefits would be payable on such a transaction

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Northland Capital Partners Inc. - Analyst   [48]

Thank you. And if I may go back to the [snee] side of things. I know Vince was successful or somewhat successful in getting more color on things. Would it be fair to suggest that the revenue growth would be above the 20% level on a year over year basis consistent with peers?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [49]

I think it will be in and around that kind of level or close to it or maybe a little bit less, but 20% on the EBITDA side as well

Drew McReynolds with RBC

 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [52]

Yes. Thank you very much. Just a follow-up on the cash taxes for you, Steve. Can you tell us out of the total CAD350 million what was actually paid in fiscal 2012?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP and CFO   [53]

Well, we are looking. The cash tax number you're looking at is cash taxes that were actually paid, so for modeling purposes the way to do it is just to assume the paid amount, and that is why I say for the 30% next year is what you should assume as being the paid amount for free cash flow purposes as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [54]

Okay, okay. And I guess just a question for Paul, more of a clarification. I think in light of the Astro deal there's been some confusion there with respect to the concentration calculations and just want to confirm that from the CRTC's perspective when they calculate Shaw Media's concentration they consider already course in that equation?

Jean Brazaeu,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP Regulatory   [55]

It's Jean here. Absolutely. We've always been regulated with the total market share of course plus Shaw Media. So, there would be absolutely no change, no structural change if you calculate or if there was a transaction (inaudible)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [56]

Okay. Thanks for that. And just wanted to, maybe from Paul, get an update on the ad market, what you're seeing currently for the fiscal Q1 period and is there any hopes here that we'd get a little bit of a pickup as we look into calendar 2013?

Paul Robertson,  Shaw Media - President   [57]

Yes, Drew, I'm happy to respond to that one. You saw what looked like a stronger market in the fourth quarter with Olympics in the marketplace and we still ended up in growth mode. So, we're pretty pleased about how we went out the summer. What we're seeing in the first quarter is market not dissimilar to a year ago, although competitively we feel like we're better positioned and we're seeing kind of similar low single digit outlook on overall ad revenue. So, I'd say it's quite stable. We are seeing all the major advertisers come back, but we're not seeing a big resurgence into kind of huge growth rates

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [58]

And on that type of trend, clearly, what my assumption would be it's not really about specially advertising as a medium, maturing in a meaningful way, it's more a cyclical phenomenon just waiting for national advertisers to gain confidence and spend more money. Is that a correct assumption?

Paul Robertson,  Shaw Media - President   [59]

Well, I think that, yes, we've been in the doldrums from the economy standpoint and the advertisers are still there and still conducting business, they're just a little more conservative than we would like them to be. And if we got a consistent turn in the economy, more positive, we definitely see a lift in the current market and we all would enjoy stronger growth rate in that cycle. So, I think it is -- it's kind of the second year of the same old, same old, but definitely if the economy improved, we would feel it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [60]

Thanks very much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [61]

Recall that last year EBITDA in media grew by 25% in year before. So, -- it's a very strong surge and then still moderate growth this year

 Matt Niknam,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst   [64]

Question on cable margins. Wondering with the competitive landscape still intense, you're talking about a greater focus on customer service going forward, is it fair to expect further margin compression in cable in fiscal '13 or are pricing tailwinds and greater cost efficiencies enough of an offset? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [65]

Overall, for this year we were just a little under 47% on the cable margins and I think for next year you should expect to see it around the same level. So, we will see some revenue growth through price increases through being more disciplined on promotions and pricing activities generally, but we will have the usual increase in costs in the first quarter, employee cost, and network costs. So, margins should be around that same level on an overall basis for the year

 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [68]

Question is on the WiFi strategy. If I understand correctly, CAD25 million spent to date on a CAD200 million CapEx total estimate. Does that kind of suggest that you've only focused on one market or does it suggest that your strategy might be changing from one of more ubiquitous coverage to one of more kind of hot spot coverage?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [69]

Well, Greg, I think we tend to focus on the major centers to start out

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [70]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [71]

And continue with that focus and I see that continuing as we go through this year. As I said earlier, it's kind of building to where they are type thing and we're pleased with the success. We did -- we see the opportunities to grow that further, but we really want to make sure we've done a good job from what we're doing now, to really managing the access and coverage point of view, and then allow the business to build up from the back side

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [72]

So, it sounds -- I think it's Brad I'm speaking to, it sounds like you are stretching out the investment program relative to what was originally intended or is am I just misunderstanding?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [73]

Could I --

Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [74]

Like, is it a five-year program now?

Jay  Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP Operations   [75]

Maybe I -- it's Jay. Maybe I can jump in on some of the economics. I'm not sure we have ever had the size of our WiFi build properly scoped. I know we've got a number of numbers that have existed in the marketplace and I think the numbers that have existed in the marketplace are high end of what we think the total build. There has not been a change in strategy. We remain committed to WiFi. We're making great progress both in terms of access points and also customer usage even during a trial

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [76]

Yes, and just remember with AT&amp;T, China Telecom, and these WiFi costs and equipment and everything have really come down come down in a significant way over time, so we're seeing the benefit of that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [77]

Right

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [78]

So, CAD200 million to Jay's point would be a high number for the build as we see it today

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [79]

Okay. That's a fair point. And then just final question. Can I assume that there is no assumption for commercial deployment in the guidance that you've given for this year, that anything, if there was a commercial deployment announcement this year in fiscal '13, that that would be incremental to what you guided?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [80]

What are you implying with commercial deployment there, Greg, just be clear?

Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [81]

If you decided to launch a service commercially, I know that's still a question mark as to whether that would be something we will see in '13 or not. I might surmise that would change the outlook for subscribers or the revenue line depending on what your model would be?

Jay  Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP Operations   [82]

No. We haven't built that in at this point. We continue to make progress in the network and we want to make sure we've got a great network for customers. And there are modernization opportunities in the future, but certainly not that are planned for the coming year or this year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [83]

And would you advise me not to assume a '13 commercial deployment in any of your markets or is that still a question?

Jay  Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP Operations   [84]

Yes. Good advice

Maher Yaghi, Desjardins

 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [87]

Second quarter a nice pickup in stand-alone additions. Can you maybe tell us what's going down there? Is it the function of taking subscribers from -- that were on DSL from your competition or is it the function of maybe customers dropping their cable?

Jay  Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP Operations   [88]

I think the primary driver of that goes back to Vince's question about business Internet ads. We are having great success selling business and Internet and phone of course into the small market; video is much less relevant in that space

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [89]

Okay. And just on the subscriber front on the cable side. Now, in general, we're seeing let's say stable decline in subscribers on the cable side. Is there a point where the declines could cause margins depression on the cable front? Are we far from that point where the fixed costs are going to start to become a bit too much to handle, or it's just a matter of weighting in the decline on cable and the gains in high-speed Internet and phone they make up for each other's decline and gains on the margin side?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [90]

With 2.2 million video customers and 1.9 million Internet customers, we are an awful lot way from having that discussion. On the video side I think people look at the 16,000 customer loss as the same for Rogers. We're looking at sustainability overall in total RGUs, but we're balancing the profitability and we're balancing maintaining that stability. You will see some leakage, but the important thing is that through pricing discipline and promotional discipline and cost discipline, we're -- our margins have improved by 60 basis points from the second quarter. We generated 60,000 RGUs. At this time we're relatively flat, but our margins were up 600 basis points. So, I think we said we were going to focus on operational efficiency and real discipline in terms of pricing and promotions. We are demonstrating that this quarter. There is some leakage, but very small number on a very large base

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [91]

Okay. Great. And just on the phone, on the Digital Phone subscriber front. Are you seeing any incremental increases in any wireless substitution on your markets?

Jay  Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP Operations   [92]

Yes, I don't think we are really seeing wireless substitution on our market. We certainly have a growing double play market that is a very strong and profitable market for us. Customers who have TV and Internet and don't subscribe to a home phone from anybody. There's a group there, but we wouldn't describe cord cutting as a problem for us on the Digital Phone side of the business

 Blair Abernethy,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst   [95]

Just two quick things. First, I wonder if you can comment a little bit on the Shaw Go strategy and I know it's only a couple of weeks out there, but any sort of thoughts on the traction with the first two apps and where are you going down the road? Are there more apps, ideas in the pipe?

Jay  Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP Operations   [96]

Yes, there are ideas in the pipe. I think what we're trying to do is to provide apps that are really relevant to our customers and certainly the two that we've launched have had great appeal and there is a certain sizzle to the NFL Sunday Ticket that we launched last week when we were in Calgary and we had NFL Sunday Ticket customers there and they absolutely loved the app because it has relevance to them. They are football fanatics, taking NFL Sunday Ticket. And the features that were built into that fairly address what it makes the experience for them one that they would want -- add value to the NFL Sunday Ticket value

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [97]

Blair, it really -- when you look at the movie centerpiece, it really creates value in that ecosystem for that cable authenticated back to that cable and satellite customer. We have a schedule here. You will see us continue to do launches through the year going forward. We believe there is a real appetite in the market for that and it's something that we're committed to creating that value proposition and this is just another example of how we're creating value within the system

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Blair Abernethy,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst   [98]

Great, thanks. And just, Steve, a quick question for you. On the balance sheet you've got some debt maturity next month and then again a year from now, about CAD800 million coming up. What are your thoughts on that and can you just remind us your bank lines I think it is CAD1 billion. Is that fully available at this point?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP and CFO   [99]

Yes, it's fully available. We ended the year with CAD430 million in cash and so we're still looking at how we'll handle that maturity. We may draw down short-term bank debt and anyway, that's still an open question at this point. But we've got plenty of liquidity and plenty of cash, so there is lots of flexibility here for us

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Blair Abernethy,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst   [100]

 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [2]

Hello. Good afternoon or good morning guys. Your cable EBITDA was very strong this quarter, despite some cost inflations. So just a couple of clarification questions. How much was related to the reduction in the [out put] in the quarter? My rough calculation gets me sort of to less than CAD5 million. Am I in the ballpark?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [3]

No. It's lower than that, Phillip. It would be less than CAD2 million

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [4]

Okay. Great. And then secondly, you had lower marketing and sales expense this quarter. Should we just think of this as seasonal before marketing picks up again next quarter? Your overall cable OpEx this quarter went up only 1.5% sequentially, despite a 3% to 5% cost inflation. I guess I'm trying to determine whether cost can be sustained at the current level going forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Unidentified Company Representative,  Shaw Communications Inc   [5]

Well, marketing costs are down from last year, and that's more a function of last year's activity. We have rolled out our new brand platform and our new advertising platform, but a lot of that was rolled out in the last month of the quarter. And so you'll see additional spend on that in future quarters. Also, we're somewhat behind in terms of people hiring right now, and we do have additional people in certain areas where we need to beef up. And the last thing is that there are additional network feeds that are coming in future quarters. But -- and so you will see some additional pressure in future quarters from that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  UBS - Analyst   [6]

Okay. And should we see the full effect of it by the next quarter? Or do you think it's more gradual over the course of the year, the fiscal year?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP of Operations   [7]

Yes Phillip, it's Jay. I think in terms of the next quarter you'll certainly see the full run rate of marketing in terms of staffing levels. It's not a large number, and it's mostly in strategic areas. We're fully hired in our customer service areas. So you'll see us ramping to that over time. The network feeds, there is one significant network agreement that has its annual rate increase January 1. So you'll see that January 1. But that's what's applying some pressure in the network feeds

Vince Valentini

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [10]

Thanks very much. I have two specific questions, and then one somewhat related general one. The specific ones first. The tax benefit from that pension contribution you guys made, I think you were expecting here about a CAD75 million reduction in cash taxes in 2013 from that. Can you just tell us how much of that was already achieved in the first quarter? The second specific one is on the digital network upgrade. I noted in your commentary you said that spending CapEx has come down significantly year-over-year. Is that project just about complete so that there should be minimal amounts in Q2 and beyond?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [11]

Well, we'll start with the VMU. So, hey Vince it's Peter. So in the first quarter, we managed the VMU so that there wasn't a conflict that would be relevant to cell phone traffic and in response to that in contracts for sort of the normal ordinary part busy season. So you will see that the VMU activity pick up going forward. There's a couple other capillaries as well that would include something such as the Anik G satellite payments was deferred and it will be coming. There are some additional facilities costs that will be a part of the second half of this fiscal '13. There still are some branding costs associated -- capital branding costs. These are things like signage, and trucks, et cetera. And there are some favorable Motorola pricing that we were able to negotiate with them. And so the costs are probably moderated now than they were over last year

And we're seeing some reverse logistics -- we have seen some reverse logistic benefits that essentially reselling some of the equipment that has come is being cycled through our warehouse, and is now being sold to customers at a discount. But it's really making sure that we're handling those kind of warehouse levels and utilizing our equipment as much as possible. And we are working towards a bring your own equipment approach to an equipment included model, which really is the -- it sort of infers that there's going to be some contracts associated with that approach which could have an impact on capital. And those are sort of the major components that you'll see occurring over the next couple of quarters

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Unidentified Company Representative,  Shaw Communications Inc   [12]

Vince, in terms of the tax, let me explain first that as we've noted in the free cash flow section of the press release, we funded the SERP for CAD300 million. That is a financing event as far as we're concerned. We're taking an unfunded liability, and funding 75% of it. And so essentially it's a use of free cash flow, not a subtraction of free cash flow. And that's supported also by the fact that this is a discretionary payment. This is not a required payment

So similarly, we would expect to see the CAD75 million tax deduction this year. While you will see it going into the income statement, it will not be included in free cash flow, that recovery. In the first quarter, the impact of that is about CAD20 million. But we had a bit of a lower tax rate as well, there's a few other things going on. We did have some loss utilization in subsidiaries as well, but that would give you a sort of sense of where we're at in the first quarter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [13]

Okay. Great. And the general question. You may have answered them a little bit, but I just wondered what your definitions are of modest and comparable given your guidance for the year is modest EBITDA growth, and you've put up a pretty impressive 6% growth number in the first quarter. The first quarter is seasonally one of your bigger quarters as well. And on the free cash flow side, much more so. You think it will be comparable to last year, but you're up over 100% in the first quarter. So do you think the guidance now looks conservative, or do you really think there's some big events coming in future quarters that make the year-over-year growth rates way worse than what we just saw here in Q1?

Unidentified Company Representative,  Shaw Communications Inc   [14]

Well certainly, we have a skew in terms of the CapEx spending rate. And that's what Peter was going through in the second half of the year. And so we'll see that. There are some moderating factors in EBITDA coming in the coming quarters. I would say at this point, Vince, our plan would be to look at the guidance again and come back to you in April at mid year and give a refreshed view to that

 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [17]

Thanks, and good afternoon. I've got a few questions. First, just on the television subscriber trends. Wondering if you can give us some color on the trends on gross additions and also churn. I'm wondering if there is -- the decline in TV subs is more because of a reduction in gross adds or whether churn continues to pick up?
 The other question is related to the pension contribution. Just curious about the timing as to why you're doing that now, because that under funded position has been around for a bit. So I'm just wondering why -- some question about the timing

And then, lastly, on just the capital CapEx profile going forward over the long term. As we look further out, post-DNU, what should we think about in terms of your CapEx intensity or your CapEx profile? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [18]

Jeff, I'll just start and maybe Jay will add a little bit on. We're very much focused on customer profitability, and we have very much a discipline, and it's both profitability on retention and acquisition. And so, you're not seeing, I think we're seeing the benefit of churn, and also maybe the detriment of the gross sales. But for quality and quality customers and we're very much focused on that. And Jay maybe you want to add a little bit to that. But that's just a reflection of our continued focus in that regard

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [19]

For sure, Brad. I think it's clear that the plan and certainly Brad's direction has been around quality customers, the last being best served approach is the opposite of our philosophy. And so we're certainly going to continue down this path of balancing customer profitability with subscription revenue growth. And I think that's for sure our path

In terms of your question on television churn versus gross sales, we can tell you that we subscribe our television churn rate as positive. It's certainly not increasing. And it's a big area of focus for us. So the lessening in the results is certainly on the gross sales side

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [20]

Okay

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Unidentified Company Representative,  Shaw Communications Inc   [21]

Jeff, in terms of the pension contribution, so there was a number of important things that happened essentially at the end of last year. We closed our plan. There are 15 SERP members, there's eight active and seven retired. So there will be no additional people coming into the plan. We also froze base salaries at 2012 levels, so that what happens of course from an actuarial point of view and those numbers that you see in the comp table assume that there was an increase in compensation until the eligible retirement date. What we've done is we've said that for the base portion of the salary, it will be frozen at the 2012 amounts. The calculation of the eligible amount at the retirement date. So to the extent that base salaries were to go up, they would not -- those increases would not be included in the pension amount. And so that resulted in a CAD25 million curtailment gain last year or reduction of the expense. And as you can see in the comp table, it actually results a bit in Brad and I showing negative compensation in total

In terms of part of that we also looked at funding, and we felt that it was an opportune time to fund. First of all, let me say that the pension liability is treated as debt by most of the credit rating agencies. So funding this is just essentially debt for debt. Interest rates are low. So you know that the liability in these plans is very high as a result of that. And so it's a good time to fund. We would be potentially could term it out at low interest rates as well at this point. But currently, we've decided just to finance it on our credit facility. So we're financing it at 3%. And the net cost of doing that is nominal when you look overall at the how the retirement compensation arrangements work

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [22]

And on the CapEx profile longer term?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP of Operations   [23]

Well, I think Peter talked a little bit about the -- some of the one-time impacts in the CapEx profile. I think what you're seeing in CapEx is two things. There are the timing things that Peter indicated. There are also -- we're realizing significant benefits from our -- we're now 18 months into our operational efficiency programs, and all of our procurement efforts. Reverse logistics are very visible in the numbers. So that if you look at the CapEx, you could probably look at it as an equal blend of timing and real savings

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [24]

Sorry. I guess my question was more if we look beyond this fiscal year, just kind of a general direction in trends

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP of Operations   [25]

That sort of summary statement would be that we're confident in the free cash flow profile of company in the medium and the long term

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [26]

Yes. We're aware of the sensitivities around CapEx intensity and we manage around that. So, I think we have demonstrated that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [27]

Yes. And those projects will come off as we finish them. That CapEx intensity will come down. And just as we said before, that's the clearest way we see for free cash flow growth, and we're committed to that growth

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotia Capital - Analyst   [28]

Great. Thanks very much

Tim Casey

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [30]

Thanks. Could you talk a little bit about the impact of SME on the quarter? You alluded in the first quarter that SME was offsetting some potential weakness in voice and data. I'm just wondering how that trend is going, and if you can comment is that positive on -- are you still net positive on core cable additions? Or is that negative being offset by SME?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP of Operations   [31]

Tim, it's Jay. And I alluded to the answer last time. And so I guess we can do this every time. It's my fault. We can confirm that our residential business was up in both internet and telephone in the quarter. We were pleased with our results in SME and also pleased with our results in the mid market. But we did have a small increase in internet costs on the residential side and certainly on (inaudible)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [32]

And would you -- are you increasing your investment in SME? Or should we think about that as more of a stable business? How would you characterize SME for us?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP of Operations   [33]

We would characterize the business segment, which certainly includes SME, includes wholesale, includes increasing presence in the medium-sized business side. We would characterize that whole business as a CAD250 million business with mid teen growth rates

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [34]

And are you spending aggressively in that business, or would it have a similar CapEx profile in terms of intensity to your overall business?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP of Operations   [35]

There are some specific spends with regards to OSS and BSS costs so that we definitely have a separate OSS business system to manage that business. As we have always kind of tried to take the approach is that we'll spend prudently, and it will be reflected in the kind of business opportunities that exists within the SME business

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [36]

But Tim, to answer your question, it does have a higher CapEx profile than our overall cable CapEx taken together

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [37]

Yes. And Tim, I would say on top of that, is just our approach has always been to go into some of these greenfield, brownfield, and build to one customer and do that. We're going to take maybe a little different approach in some areas in regards to building out and then coming back and selling to the base versus doing the opposite. So you're going to see some different tactics we take on going forward

Glen Campbell

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [40]

Yes. Thanks very much. First on the DRIP, your free cash flow profile is very strong. You're not doing the buy -- or you've got the buyback reactivated but not in use. Have you thought about or are you planning to discontinue the DRIP? And then I had a couple of follow ups as well. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Unidentified Company Representative,  Shaw Communications Inc   [41]

No. I think the DRIP is an effective way to do sort of a longer term dollar cost averaging of equity issue. On an annual basis, it contributes about CAD80 million. We think it's positive for shareholders. We pay our dividends out on a monthly basis. You know that our shareholder base has certainly increased very substantially in terms of the amount of income investors that are there and were being put into hybrid funds as well. Fixed-income hybrid funds. And so the DRIP is working well for us. For this year, we'll pay out CAD440 million of dividends. And when you look at the DRIP off that, it comes down to CAD360 million. Which is about 75% of our free cash flow at the current forecast rate

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [42]

Okay. Thanks. And then two follow-ups. One is on the DNU upgrade. You're making fast progress towards digitizing the analog tiers. But I guess at year end you had 17%, if I've got it right, 17% at the 250Mb plus capability level. How fast do you expect to increase that, and when do you think you might be through that program?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP of Operations   [43]

We'll be finished the DNU, we call it DNU1, which is all of the discretionary tiers by the end of this fiscal year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [44]

Okay. And then the upgrade to 250Mb?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP of Operations   [45]

That's included in the project

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [46]

That's part of that, yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [47]

Okay. And that would mean across your whole footprint?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [48]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [49]

Okay. Great. And then the last one. On the subscriber trend, there was I guess for us an unexpected downturn on the satellite side. And I was wondering if you could maybe give us a bit of color there, and then talk about maybe trends in the current quarter and anything you might be doing marketing-wise to change the trajectory

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Unidentified Company Representative,  Shaw Communications Inc   [50]

Thanks Glen, actually a great question. We certainly continue to take a balanced approach to subscriber growth, and our focuses and it continues to be focusing on profitability. In Q1, subscriber losses were due really to new acquisitions. So churn remains the same and it's really positive. But certainly, across the country there's really aggressive offers that we just not necessarily seek to match. We do though see looking forward targeted growth opportunities as we continue to still take a balanced approach as we launch the new VOD services. We see us also adding services to the base that eventually over time will add financial value to the satellite division as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [51]

Thanks. And then in-quarter trends in satellite and cable?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP of Operations   [52]

I think speaking to both satellite and cable, it's clear we have a plan. It's clear that we're sticking to the plan, and focused on exceptional customer experience, on leading technology, on customer profitability, and operational efficiency. And we've got 14,500 people continuing to execute that plan. So I think you'll see some similarities as we go forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [53]

We're pleased where we're at

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [54]

So pleased in terms of the Q1 trajectory or Q2 versus Q1?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [55]

I would say in regards to the Q1 trajectory. And just that momentum last half of last year. So we're going to continue to see that. As Jay said, as we have that rigor and focus on a continuation basis here

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP of Operations   [56]

And so if you were doing a thermometer on customer experience and you were doing a year-over-year measurement of that thermometer, we're very pleased with what we've achieved in the last year. The customer experience is frankly exemplary compared to where we have been. And that's just a great deal of effort, and ensuring we have the resources in our call centers to provide the kind of response that we're making with our customers

We're really pleased with where we're going with regards to kind of online kind of support where customers really become their own customer service representative. And they can put services together. They can authenticate services. And these are things that are now made possible through some of the things that we're doing with our back office systems as we evolve those back office systems. We're pleased with the products and the way that the products are working for our customers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [57]

And let me just speak for a second to the perception of a weakness in subscriber results. I think we need to remind people again that the strategy here is to protect core RGUs and to grow core RGUs. We grew them by 95,000 last year. This quarter, we're basically flat for RGUs and cable. Slightly down in satellite, as we talked about. But that's very much part of the strategy here

We're not looking to hit the ball out of the park in terms of subscriber growth. We're looking for that balance between profitability, and certainly we're achieving profitability and maintaining the base of our subscriber revenue-generating unit. So a flat quarter when you look at it net is not necessarily out of line with how we would see things. Because we're not looking to be aggressive in terms of growing RGUs. And I think one of the things that's important to keep in mind and particularly in the environment today from a competitive point of view, revenue increases are going to come much more from the ability to have pricing power on products, and particularly the internet than they will from subscriber growth going forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [58]

Yes. And TELUS is a tremendous competitor. And we give them a lot of credit. It's actually probably polarized us and given us a lot of rigor in our business that we've maybe not have had as much of that and we have. So, a lot of credit goes over there. But listen, I think we're doing an incredible job also, and it's going to go from -- I believe it's going to go from a pricing decision to a service decision to a customer experience decision. And we're all chasing that, and we're all doing the best we can to get there. And I think our numbers reflect that

But what I will say is that we've always said that there's room for two strong competitors in Western Canada. And we are encouraged by the number of developments over the last year in regards to disciplined behavior in Western Canada. So, that gives you a sense. And so we're committed to that -- this strategy, and that's what you'll see going forward

Drew McReynolds

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [61]

Yes, thanks very much. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe over to you, Paul, on the media side. Obviously a pretty good quarter. Can you just talk to any impact from the NHL strike in the quarter, and just how Q2 is tracking?

Paul Robertson,  Shaw Media - President   [62]

Sure. Thanks Drew. Yes, so it's Paul here. With respect to the performance of the ad market in the first quarter, it was pretty solid compared to a year ago. Probably in site growth it looks like. With respect to the NHL in particular, it skewed some dollars probably from conventional to specialty perhaps. We were the beneficiary of some of it. Not a significant amount. So in the kind of CAD3 million to CAD5 million range perhaps over the period. So, and the major strength that we saw was based on the improvement in our programming mix where we were able to increase our share of the top ten programming on global. And that was significant improvement compared to a year ago with moving from 3 of 10 to 6 of 10. 6 out of 10 in the period. So, we felt that the lift that we got was primarily due to program mix, although we know we did get a little bit of fallout from hockey money

With respect to the trend into the second quarter I think we're seeing -- it's still kind of early because the business continues to come in. But I think we're seeing a similar kind of performance. Often if you set a good pace from a programming standpoint in Q1, you can continue it on. And given that the shows -- we've still got four shows that we've picked up this year that are possibly going to be renewed next year. So we're still in the money in terms of the shows that we bought. So, yes, no we're enjoying a good trend line there, and expect the second quarter will continue to show the same kind of positive trend in the market

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [63]

Okay. Thanks for that. And just a couple of follow ups for you, Steve. Just on the pension contribution, is there any related P&amp;L benefits with it?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [64]

Yes. A small related P&amp;L benefit, because we don't have an interest component in the actuarial expense. So you will see probably about a CAD9 million to CAD10 million improvement in EBITDA as the results of that no longer being factored through that actuarial expense

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [65]

Okay. Thanks for that. And then the cash tax rate for modeling purposes, I think you alluded to 30% last quarter. Presumably no change to that if you exclude, obviously, the one-time cash benefit tax benefit on the contribution?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [66]

I think 30% is still a good rate to use for this year. And we'll come back and look at that in the half year as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [67]

Okay. And then just, finally, just on Shaw Go. Just could you provide us with an update just on how that product is going?

Unidentified Company Representative,  Shaw Communications Inc   [68]

It's going very well. We've launched Movie Central HBO Go which is really the major product. We have NFL Sunday Ticket. The season is over, but that was also a very successful launch. We're on NBA League Pass now, which is proving to be very successful as well. And we've got a number of new bill applications in the hopper, which we will likely launch in the next little while focused on kids, focused on a variety of other programming services. So we've created the store. We're now stocking the shelves. But it's proven to be very successful from the customer point of view

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [69]

Okay. Thanks very much

Operator   [70]

Rob Goff

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Byron Capital  - Analyst   [71]

Thank you very much. My first question would be on the business side. You indicated that the capital intensity on business was modestly higher. Could you comment on the margin impact? Is it accretive, dilutive to margins? And secondly, in looking back on the changes in the wireless space, how much you have changed your view towards wireless, be that WiFi or other wireless applications?

Unidentified Company Representative,  Shaw Communications Inc   [72]

So just again on the capital intensity. So capital intensity of the business would be in the high 20% range as both of our overall capital intensity. In terms of margin in the business -- the business margins are accretive overall to margins. And then there was a third part there? WiFi. WiFi. So we absolutely made the right decision in terms of wireless. WiFi, as we all know, it's probably one of the fastest growing segments in terms of local access in the wireless space. So our strategy makes perfect sense. We're building out a wireless network to support our broadband customers. And that's exactly what's happening here. So that was a good decision. I don't think we have any regrets in terms of not building a traditional mobile network. The market as you know, is extraordinary. The capital intensity is very high and it's very tough to get into this business as the fourth or fifth player in the market

So, we capture lots of wireless utilization, if you will, by doing things like obviously the WiFi build. But even offering things like Shaw Go, which is available to any wireless customer in any wireless network. It doesn't necessarily have to be WiFi. But what we've found, and this is sort of an obvious observation is that people would prefer to consume it on WiFi because it's cheap or virtually no cost. So we're very happy with the decision and the strategy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [73]

It's very positive

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [74]

Absolutely

Maher Yaghi

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [77]

Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to just follow up on the WiFi deployment. Could you update us on the CapEx you've spent in the quarter? And maybe what could be remaining later this year? And if there were some revenues that you generated from WiFi directly or indirectly on the wholesale level, could you maybe update us on that?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [78]

Well, I'll just start on WiFi. Our focus is access and coverage. We have engaged -- we've got probably 55 municipalities or communities we're engaged with who provide access. We are continuing to work on that. And for now, it's getting us to a point where we do have that coverage across the metropolitan areas. And that's our focus and that will be our focus in the near term. As far as the CapEx, Jay?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP of Operations   [79]

We're on a slightly ramped up run rate from last year. I don't have the quarterly WiFi number precisely in front of us and some of it is shared engineering and other expenses that we don't have specifically broken out. So we're in a slightly ramped up process from last year

In terms of the monetization and the return on investment on things like WiFi and Shaw Go, we would like to make a couple of comments. If you look at our focus on churn in our business and this is what all of this is about, is the exceptional customer experience, TV everywhere with Shaw Go, WiFi, it's all supposed to drive retention and reduce churn and increase our pricing power. But certainly what we've seen so far is Movie Central churn is materially down since we lost Movie Central Go

And while its early days on the WiFi project, our customers who use our WiFi service, our Internet customers who use our WiFi service compared to our internet base that doesn't use our WiFi service, our churn is less than half on the internet base that uses the WiFi service. Now it's early days, and we don't think you can necessarily take that. We won't let anybody use that in a spreadsheet because it's (inaudible) -- and it's early as [ofters]. But the trends are encouraging. That the churn story on WiFi is important. And it drives retention in pricing power, which is really the key to the whole strategy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [80]

Okay. Great. And on the pension, it's definitely investor friendly what you guys have decided to do on capping the salaries on the pension. Can you maybe -- you talked about the timing on why you made the pension contribution CAD300 million. Can you talk a little bit about why you've decided to cap that pension in terms of salaries at the end of employment? Why now? Is it because of the low interest rates? The fact that it's becoming too expensive to support? Or there's more behind it than that?

Unidentified Company Representative,  Shaw Communications Inc   [81]

No. We -- obviously, we look at compensation on an overall basis each year. We've used this pension plan historically because -- and not granted stock options, because we have a controlling shareholder and granting stock options when 80% of your family wealth is already tied up in the business doesn't actually add a lot of incentive. So years ago, the plan was designed with a pension component. Last year, we decided when we took a look at it again, that it was time and it was appropriate to close the plan and to freeze the base salaries. And that was something that management agreed with the Board would be appropriate. And so there's nothing in particular in the timing. It's just a part of our annual look at compensation

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) Glen Campbell, Bank of America

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [2]

I wanted to ask about cable subscriber trends and also about CapEx. On the cable subscribers, could you talk a little bit about the trend in the quarter and whether we're seeing any improvement in the trend going into the next quarter? On CapEx, you've given sort of an out-year figure, if I've got it right, of around CAD750 million as normal CapEx once this accelerated CapEx is done. Should we think of that as being the kind of number you're shooting for, for F'16? Does it include success-based capital related to set tops and could you maybe give us a bit of a sense of what the network would look like then? Would the size be where you want them to be, would that be a steady state? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [3]

First of all, Glenn, let me just talk about subscriber trends and maybe just focus on that for a minute for the benefit of all of the investors listening on the call. What we see in some of the pre-reports here seems to be an inordinate amount of focus on video subscribers as a separate and discrete item. As you know, and as many have discussed, we're moving towards becoming a broadband company and so the focus on video seems to be in relation to the overall reporting of all of the things we've done for the quarter to be a bit lost in the past and to be a bit out of place. As Brad said in his speech, we were disciplined on promotions, we are doing three month promotions now and are supporting discipline in the market. We also had lower equipment activity and you can see that from approximately an CAD80 million decline in success-based CapEx from this year, year-to-date to last year. If you look at how we think about our business, and so people understand, our focus is to balance profitability and free cash flow while maintaining our overall base of RGUs. To put it simply, RGUs is obviously an industry term, but if you think about it, it's 6.3 million products that we sell to customers

Out of that 6.3 million products, this quarter we lost 7,600 core RGUs. A core RGU would be video plus internet plus phone plus satellite. In terms of maintaining that overall base, that's a 0.1% reduction in the base. Our focus is not specifically on video. We could manage video if we wanted to, to get to a higher number, but we're managing RGUs overall and we expect as we do that, that we'll see a move to higher margin internet customers going forward away from video subscribers. Basically, the theme of this is that in the old days you thought about the video customer as the base, but that is not the case now. The base customer now is an internet customer and that's how we're looking at the overall mix of everything

I think what's really important to ensure that's how we're making sure that what we talk about the difference between balancing free cash flow and profitability and the base, it's to ensure there's not an overall erosion of the base. The key also going forward and I think that this is important for analytical investor purposes, is it's really not subscriber growth that's going to drive results going forward. It's going to be more the ability to be able to price products and offer value to customers and in our market out here in the West, certainly there's been much more discipline. Our main competitor and us both recognize that there's a significant value in internet and that there's significant value going forward and that we're lower than the East and that there are opportunities to monetize the value that we're providing in part just to keep up with the significant network investments we're making to manage peak capacity. Peak capacity last year was up 50% in one year. It would be, I think, disadvantageous for us to focus on video, specifically. I think that would be something that would not be worthwhile for us or investors

Our approach is to look holistically and so I think we need to reset expectations a little bit here and say that's how we think about it. We think about it in overall RGU terms. Our goal is, what we're trying to do, is for the year to make sure that we don't lose more than 1% of that 6.3 million RGUs, so that's roughly our target for the year. To date, we've lost 12,600,12,200 but it's within the mix. We will see it moving to higher margin products and it's not a focus on video, so I think people should take those comments back. With regard to CapEx, on the normalized side, this year we'll see cable CapEx at CAD750 million. That's penetration, that's CapEx intensity of about 23%

Going forward, we see that being pretty well a stable amount, a stable amount for investors to consider. It will be a little bit higher next year simply because we've got a lot of the Shaw Corp restoration cost next year, so we will see a little blip specifically on that, but if you look at it that's the baseline CapEx going forward out to 2015. Now when you get to 2015, that should get you down to about 20% CapEx intensity and then from there forward, we see that reducing. We see it reducing in part because we're accelerating some very important strategic investments with very high returns. One is the data center, as Brad talked about, WiFi initiatives, and our applications. Also, then, the other side of that is looking at further hardening the network, further digitization, further capacity for broadband and HD and VOD. What we're trying to do with the accelerated capital fund is we're saying we have sold off some assets that weren't strategic

We've made a 50% gain on our sale to Rogers on those assets. We also have CAD100 million in Corus, so in total, we've got about CAD800 million of proceeds and we're looking to invest CAD500 million of those sooner than they would have been invested in the past, because they are important from a strategic viewpoint to get them done and because they're high return projects. We want to separate this out for investors so they can see the two flows. If we normalize the cable CapEx at CAD750 million, that will give you that free cash flow number a good sense of free cash flow being generated by the business and how we expect to see that going forward. The other CAD500 million, notionally, we're saying is coming out of cash that we have on hand as a result of these sales and we're using the cash to do that rather than subtracting and [mishmash] it altogether from the operating free cash flow number. That was a lengthy answer to your question. Did I get there?

 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [6]

Maybe just to follow on to that, Steve, you talked about the enhancing the return of the business once all the accelerated spending is done. Can you maybe talk a little bit about that? I know you probably don't want to give too much specifics in terms of growth or margins, but can you help us understand what network you believe will look like once all this is done, the kind of service that you think that will allow you to be fully competitive and have the visibility on whether it's subscriber, ARPU, and growth going forward? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [7]

I think it's early days for that, Jeff. As we said in our press release, we're talking up to CAD500 million and we've given investors the ability to understand how we're thinking about the timing of that; CAD100 million this year, CAD250 million next year and then CAD150 million the following year. All of that can change as we go through. One of the big buckets, of course, is looking at the further digitization of the network, what comes out of that in terms of capacity for additional broadband, and how we're set up for customers. We've got our existing box strategy, which we'll talk a little bit about further along, so it's hard to actually define that in specific terms. We'll see one of the things we're seeing here that we're beginning an exploration of IPTV, and we'll see the speed and time of that and where we come out. But we recognize that looking at IPTV is an important function of the business going forward and that's part of the proceeds that we'll be using here

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [8]

Okay, maybe to touch on another area. On your business segment, with the acquisition of Envision, can you maybe talk a little bit about what it adds to that particular strategy and going after some of the businesses in your area?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP Operations   [9]

Jeff, it's Jay. In terms of the Envision deal, it's modest in scope and impact, but we really like the deal on a whole bunch of levels. It certainly gives us growth opportunity, provides us with fiber network, as Brad says, that connects us to over 560 buildings in Calgary. The replacement value of that network would be substantial if you could even replace it. From an access point of view, it would take many years and we couldn't get access to all those buildings. What's fantastic about the network is when you layer it on top of our network as we did in the process, we were delighted to see it really is hand in glove and we didn't have very much duplication between our two networks at all. We're excited that we're adding a great team

We've had a chance to meet with every employee and 40 staff that fit perfectly into our growth plans and some of the needs we had for our team, so we're excited about that. Long-term agreement with ENMAX Power that is both a win-win for us and extends our relationship with the City of Calgary and there's big growth opportunities. This has been a data-only play Calgary-only play, so when you bring it together with Shaw and by the way, the team has done an extraordinary job of building this business, when you bring it together with Shaw, you can add voice services, long haul to other markets, and really the strength of our combined products. We think it's a nice tuck in acquisition for us

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [10]

Can you help me understand why the overlap is actually not as big, because being in Calgary, why isn't your network where they are?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [11]

Well a lot of the reason is that we have some overlap in the downtown core in certain areas, but our network was built as residential network. We're not, we don't have fiber in any extensive capacity out into business parks and that. This also includes that. I think one of the important things in this deal is we're picking up 360 customers, but we're also picking up access to 560 buildings here. The importance of fiber, given the symmetrical nature of fiber, where coax is not symmetrical, you have a great download speed, but not always as good an upload speed, fiber gives you that symmetry which really allows us to sell other services to customers in a much more effective way. It's really the focus of our cable base having been more residential that has resulted in a little overlap here

 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [14]

First thing on the Envision as well, 560 buildings seemed like a lot to me for the City of Calgary. Do you know how many buildings there are? Would you have virtually every building covered now with that network?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP Operations   [15]

I don't have a stat, for example, how many buildings there are. It's a significant network and as you think about it as an organization that has access through these buildings as being the power provider, there was a very strategic choice to leverage that access and build fiber. That choice has worked out very well for ENMAX and the citizens of Calgary because they built a real nice business off that. It's a very, very strong fiber network and I think it really enhances our ability to compete, particularly in the oil and gas segment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [16]

It's not just downtown core, Vince, as you might think about Toronto Hydro or something. Because it is so extensive in the industrial parks as well, that's where you get access to a lot of areas where we had to build fiber to be able to compete effectively

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [17]

That's good. Are there any of these type of assets in any of your other major centers, Vancouver, Edmonton, specifically, maybe, that you could look to acquire as well?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [18]

Nobody on the radar screen, but if anybody wants to give us a phone call we'll be glad to listen

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [19]

Okay. Two more just quick follow-ups -- the CAD250 million for strategic CapEx, obviously the biggest year is 2014 in your guidance you've given us. Is that in some way contingent on the spectrum sale to Rogers going through? Because obviously Industry Canada still has to approve that deal. If that doesn't go through for some reason would you consider cutting back on that CAD250 million amount for next year or is that pretty much committed in your mind whether that sale goes through or not?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [20]

Maybe we should talk about this. Why don't we talk about the sale going through first and our opinion of the sale going through and then go from there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jean Brazeau,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP Regulatory Affairs   [21]

Yes, Vince, Jean here. The agreement we've entered into with Rogers is in full compliance with the conditions, the license conditions on the AWS. As you know, those conditions were debated and took almost four years in the making. The only restriction is for the Minister to approve these licenses and we could sell it to anyone after 2014, so I think we're in full compliance. Changing those rules retroactively, I think, and the general comments on the consultation certainly was a consensus around this issue that this would really fly in the face of the principle of contractual certainty and really devalue the whole AWS spectrum and any future spectrum option. I think we understand why the Minister is looking into this, but at the end of the day, I think they will comply with the framework of the AWS license regime and I think the transaction will be approved by the Minister

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [22]

Just to fill that out, so basically, we expect to close Hamilton. We've had CRTC approval. Hamilton will close at the end of April for CAD400 million. We've got the CAD100 million in the Corus asset swap coming in. We have the CAD50 million already from the Rogers option premium and of course, we spent just a little bit over that on TVtrop, so we already have essentially CAD500 million of net proceeds from those strategic transactions today, so I wouldn't see that changing. We don't believe there's a likelihood that the option will be exercised. But all of this, again to say, that we're giving you up to numbers here and particularly, in the outlying years, we'll be reviewing those as we go and what we want to do in the network, what we want to do in IPTV and those kinds of things

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [23]

One last little one for me, you were nice enough to share that CAD750 million long-term CapEx figure, Steve, and you mentioned that would be about 20% of revenue. Obviously, that points to a potential revenue figure in 2016. When you think about that, is that all organic growth to get to that level or would you possibly be considering other acquisitions in your mind when you think about that longer term plan?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [24]

That's largely, in our business model, that would be basically organic growth and Envision only adds about CAD35 million of revenue so and I'd say we're getting around [20]. The point is that once you've done these hump investments and you've pushed them forward strategically, not only do you benefit strategically by having them done and they're good return investments, but you also get to a point, then, where you can actually begin to use your CapEx intensity, so it's around 20% in 2015. In 2016, we have the potential then to see that coming down further and if there are any other businesses out there for sale, we're happy to take a phone call

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [27]

Couple things on CapEx -- one, I'm just confused why you would increase your CapEx and increase your free cash flow guidance, given that the CapEx items you're talking of are core to the network. Those are operating items that are strategic, so I'm just struggling with your definition of free cash flow

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [28]

Our definition of free cash flow was developed through our planning process, and in our planning process, we identified that there would be certain things that we'd be able to do going forward if we wanted to keep free cash flow around the CAD485 million to CAD500 million area and cover dividends. The strategic sales here were very beneficial and weren't done for the reason of investing, but gave us the opportunity to do that. When you look at the data center under our model without strategic proceeds, we would have run that over a longer period. Now we have the opportunity to basically accelerate those. Nobody is saying that they're not strategic, but it's just the process of doing it is accelerated. It's really looking at it saying, Tim, these are amounts as a result of this money and as a result from the return of those investments that we're able to lever on top of the free cash flow that comes from our base business based off the CapEx that we have, the base CapEx that we expect

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [29]

Yes, but really we're just talking semantics here. These are core investments that you're funding through operations. You've sold some strategic assets, bought another strategic asset, but your core CapEx is going up here. You were going to spend it anyway, so I just -- anyway, we'll move on. Just on--

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [30]

No, but what would have happened was within that CAD750 million of core, there would have been a reallocation perhaps of being able to do less other core investments. Basically the way we're looking at this, Tim, is this is supplemental disclosure. If you look at our core base today in terms of CPE, engineering spends, IT spends, facility spends, and then the regular spend on network upgrades, new housing, main line new drops, all that kind of stuff, that gets you to roughly the CAD750 million amount. If you take the view that you subtract it from free cash flow that's fine. This is supplementary. It's just important to keep in mind, then, that if you're looking at it that way, then essentially we're paying dividends out of cash on hand

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [31]

Yes, I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on that I guess. Just on the CapEx, just a clarification. Core Cable CapEx is CAD750 million and then in '14 or '13 and '14 and then there's another CAD100 million this year and another CAD250 million next year, and then on top of that, there would be satellite and media CapEx. Have I got those notionally correct?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [32]

You've got those notionally correct. If you look at this year, there's about CAD750 million of Cable CapEx, it's about CAD120 million of Satellite which is the normalized amount for Satellite for subsidies for [90 million] plus we've got the (inaudible) cost to get it up and running and to launch it. Media CapEx tends to run around CAD30 million, so our overall CapEx for this year would be about CAD900 million, which would be down marginally from last year as we said in our guidance. But we're looking at the number that people tend to focus on and rightfully so, fairly so, is Cable CapEx intensity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [33]

Right, but there's another CAD100 million on top of that CAD750 million, right? So we're about CAD1 billion this year, all-in?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [34]

No, we're CAD900 million this year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [35]

I thought it was CAD750 million base plus the accelerated CapEx

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [36]

Yes, CAD1 billion

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [37]

CAD1 billion this year and like CAD1.1 billion or CAD1.2 billion next year? Have I notionally got that right?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [38]

Yes, that's notionally correct

Rob Goff, Byron Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Byron Capital Markets - Analyst   [41]

The first one would be on the accelerated capital fund. Should we consider those expenditures to be a non-factor when we pontificate about potential dividend pay outs or dividend changes? Secondly, does your move to put marketing more on to equipment subsidies reflect what you have seen in the external market or perhaps an assessment of what you liked or didn't like in the past promotions?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [42]

In the first one, and this is one of the reasons why I think what we're trying to do here is we're trying to say look, CAD750 million is Cable CapEx and of course, there's others, but looking at the CAD750 million is the key number here of CapEx intensity. That gives you a sense as you model this out in terms of free cash flow that's being generated by the business, in the absence of these other investments that are being funded by cash of the capacity of the business to be able to increase dividends. We think that's why that's good disclosure and then you can look at the others and say that's being funded by, notionally by cash, as a result of these sales

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Byron Capital Markets - Analyst   [43]

Perfect and I just wanted to confirm that. That's good

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [44]

Okay. In terms of equipment subsidies and I'll turn this over to Jay just to talk about it, but the one thing I do want to confirm is that equipment subsidies are in our equipment spending and customer premise equipment spending. Not just subsidies, but also, as we move forward, we talked about contracts, but all of those numbers are in that base CAD750 million

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP Operations   [45]

Just building on what Steve said, Rob, it's Jay. If you look at what's happened in the marketplace, we've lead a promotional and pricing correction in the market that really started in March 2012. Over that period of time, as you've seen, we've moved from 12-month promotions to six-month promotions and now to the really quite modest three-month promotional offers. As we follow the plan and we believe the marketplace is responding well to the plan and it's very much anchored that in the theory that last-in, best-served is the opposite of how we're going to operate our business. Our focus on the next phase of the strategy is offering our customers greater choice with both no contract and contract with equipment-included pricing, while staying away from overly promotional pricing

If you think about that, our customer proposition really includes equipment today. We don't sell analog cable to any customers today. If you look at some of the opportunity in terms of pricing power in the marketplace, we think we now, having settled the marketplace down, having got significant operational efficiency and procurement savings in the supply chain, we think we're now in the position to step into some of that pricing power and move to contract included equipment and also no contract equipment by perhaps the end of this quarter or certainly late spring

Maher Yaghi, Desjardins Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Capital Markets - Analyst   [48]

I just wanted to ask you about your pricing elasticity. I commend you on your strong job in emerging with growth in cable, even though, as you mentioned, your cable subs declined over a CAD100,000 over the last year. Can you talk a little bit about the pricing elasticity in your cable business and how much can you sustain in pricing increases to continue to show top line revenue growth in that business? The second question on the capital, accelerated capital budget, the way I see it and initially, you took on debt to buy the spectrum assets. When you sell them it's kind of similar to you had the option of repaying the debt that you took to buy these assets, but you're deciding to use the proceeds to invest in your business. In a way, it looks like to me, it's a decision to take on debt to finance CapEx. Usually those are operating CapEx, so again, I'm trying to understand the concept that you're saying that these are additional CapEx, that it's going to be invested over the next few years above our operating cash flow, but they're supported by the Company's operating cash flow through debt financing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP Operations   [49]

It's Jay. I'll start with the first question around pricing and value for money and where we see all of that going. I think it's important if you look at, well, let's stop and go back to originally, as Brad articulated on the last call, to the four areas of focus in terms of our strategy. They are delivering an exceptional customer experience, leading technology, customer profitability and operational efficiency. If you work into the customer profitability phase and all the work that's been done and we're really proud of the work the team has done both in planning and an execution side here, the revenue story is both fairly dramatic reductions in promotional offerings and some increasing in pricing and also, some upgrades in terms of the level of service that our customers are taking. If you take the first path, we think the moving away from promotions and as we indicated to you before, last-in, best-served, best-priced is the opposite of the approach that we're going to take in the business

We think that's that portion of the revenue customer profitability is healthy on so many levels and we're seeing it in reduced churn and in other factors and we think there's lots of opportunity there. In terms of overall pricing power, it really is a combination of the fact that we're coming out of an intensely competitive price war and offering value for money. I think if you look at the value for money that we're offering to our customers in terms of value-added services, we're completely focused on what we've done with sports programming, on the entire WiFi project is value for money for our internet products. Shaw Go is value for money for our internet products. Our Catch up for TV offering right is a tremendous customer experiences and all of our new user experiences are value-added services. We're building the value for our customers, and will that give a bit of an umbrella in terms of the pricing power? It's certainly our view that it will

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [50]

In terms of the second question, Maher, if you look, I'll just give you a little rundown of the year in terms of what we've been able to accomplish here when you look at debt and cash. We started the year with just over CAD400 million of cash. We're going to generate CAD500 million, CAD550 million of free cash flow. Our dividend payable will be CAD445 million less about CAD120 million for cash savings from the drip, so that brings that down to about CAD320 million let's say. We bought Envision for CAD225 million, TVtrop for CAD60 million, and we've realized CAD50 million from the spectrum premium, CAD400 million from Hamilton, and CAD100 million from Corus. So when you look at all that, we had a debt repayment in November

We did not refinance that, so we've reduced debt by CAD450 million, and we still have cash of CAD100 million today at the end of the quarter. We also funded our SERP CAD300 million and for that, we get a CAD65 million tax deduction. The CAD65 million tax deduction is not included in free cash flow because we don't include other items that are non-operating in free cash flow. You can basically add that on to the CAD550 million if you want. Including the accelerated CapEx of CAD100 million and the base CapEx numbers that I told you in the free cash flow guidance, we're still going to end up positive cash this year, somewhere between CAD50 million to CAD100 million, so we are paying off debt. We've paid off the substantial portion of the SERP liability, we bought Envision, and we're funding the accelerated capital fund and all the rest through that and we'll start the year with cash and end the year with cash

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Capital Markets - Analyst   [51]

For 2014, you expect to be also flat year-on-year or maybe a slight decline given your accelerated investment?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [52]

No, even with the accelerated investment for next year, we still expect to be cash positive

 Jeff Fan, Scotiabank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [2]

I've got a couple of questions. First on the cable business, just wanted to touch on the ARPU and margin strength there. Obviously, based on Brad's comments about a more rational competitive environment and pricing environment, that's obviously helping, but you're also coming across some relatively easier comparison to last year when a lot of these pricing impacted your numbers so I'm just trying to see how you -- as you look forward how these will likely trend over the next number of quarters or next couple of years? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [3]

Yes. So I would start by saying that if you look at last year, our average total service ARPU was CAD116. And this year we're at CAD122 average for the first three quarters. And right now for Q3, we're at CAD125, so we are seeing continued growth in consolidated service ARPU -- that -- for the cable business. Video ARPU has increased slightly and Internet ARPU continues to increase. We believe that with the strength of network and the value that we are providing for our customers with the Wi-Fi service, that there is value and pricing power in the Internet site of the business. We'll have to see what happens on video and phone. Both of those are high-margin products and there's opportunities there for increases but the key going forward really will be looking to the Internet as being a growth area

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [4]

Okay. Great. My second question is just a clarification. On your cash flow statement, it looks like Rogers has paid you guys a refundable deposit of CAD200 million for the spectrum license. My question is, was this contemplated at the beginning when this was signed? Is there anything that Shaw has to do on your side to get this upfront refundable deposit?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [5]

That's a good question, Jeff. And this was contemplated in the original deal. Rogers paid CAD50 million for the year revokable option to be able to purchase a spectrum. As part of the deal, they also provided us with a CAD200 million refundable deposit in the event that the option is not exercised. So if the option wasn't exercised we would keep the option premium and the CAD200 million would be refunded back to them. And that kicked in after the sale of Hamilton so basically, we closed Hamilton in the quarter for CAD400 million and CAD200 million of that reverted into this non-refundable deposit -- or refundable deposit, sorry

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [6]

So there's no other obligations on your side to have accept -- to receive that CAD200 million?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [7]

No

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [8]

No? And just one final question along those lines on the spectrum transfer, we saw the new policy come out this morning. I'm not sure if you guys had time to go through it but it looks like my understanding is because the framework came out today it doesn't apply to the option agreement that you and Rogers signed. Is that correct?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [9]

That's our understanding, Jeff

 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [10]

 Vince Valentini,  TD Newcrest/Waterhouse Securities - Analyst   [12]

Three questions. First of all congratulations, Michael on the retirement. So I'll try to ask one that you can answer (laughter). On set top boxes and developments there, if you can give us any update on what you're doing with the platform and if you have any thoughts about wireless set top boxes? I'll throw out my other two questions as well

Probably for Steve, just on the accelerated CapEx fund, the CAD100 million is still the plan for how much of that you'll spend this year -- can you give us any sense how much has already been spent? Sorry if it's in the MD&amp;A and I didn't see it but how much was already spent year-to-date? And third one, just to clarify on the spectrum thing, and maybe expand on it a bit for Jean, the option is already done. You didn't have to get pre-approval for that, but these rules still apply to the final decision on whether Rogers can acquire that spectrum in 2014 or if you'd just clarify that? And have you had a chance to think about this framework and do you have any update on your level of confidence that at this point in time, Rogers would be allowed to own that spectrum or whether they'd be viewed as having too much of an undue concentration of overall spectrum if they were to pick up the 20 megahertz?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [13]

Okay. Vince, it's the old guy, Peter here. On set top boxes. So we have, as you know, two primary boxes, one being the Gateway, which has really been well, well received by our customers. It provides -- it's our premium box. It's the one that allows us to record up to six different channels at the same time and play them independently in different rooms. And again, that's the state-of-the-art. We also have the Dream Gallery box, which is -- would be our medium but very high-quality experience for our customers and it comes both in HD as well as a PVR. And, as you know, you were -- the show that set top boxes and the wireless set top boxes is certainly something that will become a part of our [fare] as well. But right now what we're doing is we're making sure that the best experience possible is coming out of our Dream Gallery and our Gateway

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [14]

Vince, on the accelerated capital fund, it's -- for everybody's benefit, it's bottom of page 10, and we'll continue to have this roll as we go forward on the spending, what's been spent year-to-date and what the target spending is. In the quarter, we spent CAD40 million, and in the previous quarter we spent CAD10 million, so we are up to CAD50 million for this year. We expect to be just a little over CAD100 million for the total year. The proceeds have gone to the preliminary exploration of IPTV, expediting our Wi-Fi build, the data center, which we have under construction here at our [borrow] facility, and increasing network capacity through our GNU activities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jean Brazeau,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, Regulatory   [15]

Vince, Jean here. On the option, we had approached Industry Canada when we were negotiating the original option. So they were certainly aware of it. As for our 2014, it's very difficult to speculate what 2014 will look like and how the market will evolve the next couple years. So it's pretty speculative right now for us to have any view on what the Minister will be thinking at that time, but we're pretty hopeful that the transaction will be approved in September of 2014

I had one on revenues and a few on expenses. So the cable revenue performance, again, quite strong. No rate increases this quarter. Could you comment on the level of discounting? I'm assuming that continues to reduce. And then can you give us your thoughts on whether we'll see a rate increase on the September anniversary date and how big that might be? And then a couple on cost to follow-up. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, Operations   [19]

Glen, it's Jay. The -- there has been a tremendous amount of focus in the Business as we go through our step-by-step disciplined strategy on our recurring monthly revenue and our recurring monthly expenses. We're seeing some positive responses from all of those efforts. In terms of cable revenue, for sure, the -- our philosophy is that [last in, best served] is the opposite of how we'll do business. It's continuing to lower promotional activity. We are also benefiting from the move from 12-month promotions to 6-month promotions to 3-month promotions and so the customer base is settling down nicely. Settling down nicely from a revenue perspective. We're certainly sticking with our step-by-step strategy as we move forward in coming quarters. In terms of your specific question on expenses, can you help us with that?

Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [20]

I'm sorry. Just -- should we expect to see rate increases this September and have they've been determined?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, Operations   [21]

Yes. You'll see an annual rate increase in the early fall, and probably can have some idea of what the magnitude of that is. We continue to invest heavily in our Internet service. And it's likely where you'll see some adjustments in terms of pricing. And as you know, other costs in the business like network fees increase, but you'll see something in the early fall

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [22]

Okay. Great. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [23]

And I'd add to that, Glen, that we've now seen four consecutive quarters in cable of 48% margins. And so in terms of what we talk about in terms of balancing profitability, and subscriber retention, once again, when we look at our 6.2 million RGUs this quarter, we lost 7,600, which is a nominal sum but we're maintaining the business at a rate of profitability of 48% in cable, which is very strong

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [24]

That's great. Thanks. On the expense side of it, you've outlined some initiatives that will help drive revenues in the future and I just want to get a sense of what costs might be attached to the ones -- I was thinking our [your first G] Anik satellite, how much OpEx would come there? The new TV lineup for the fall, what kind of cost increase we might expect? And then finally the advertising campaign that you mentioned? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [25]

So on Anik, Anik add about CAD2 million per month. And there was a little bit of that in one month of this quarter so it's about CAD24 million a year for Anik G1. On advertising, our budget for next year is relatively flat on advertising overall, but we will see some of the redirection of funds as we're going to be launching a campaign, as we said in our press release, to promote satellite and Shaw Direct as been fairly quiet from a marketing perspective over some time and so that marketing will be directed towards satellite

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [26]

And then the new TV line up?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, Operations   [27]

Glen, on satellite, is that what you're referring to?

Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [28]

No. On the media side. The new programming lineup?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, Operations   [29]

Well, we did incur some additional costs in terms of the shows that we've added -- Brad mentioned 18 in the opening comments -- but we're seeing a nice, let's call it, cautious recovery in the advertising market with the automotive sector, the retail sector coming back. We have acquired additional rights for TV Everywhere, which we think will ultimately pay off here in terms of protecting the overall ecosystem for the television programming area. And those rights are pretty decent. We've got a total of 17 shows, with full-season stacking rights for TVE. That includes pretty much everything, so live streaming of that programming available to any device to authenticate a subscriber, so that's an incremental cost, but we do expect incremental revenue associated with that. And on the linear side of the business, in terms of program [value up], while we did have a marginal increase in foreign programming [buy] costs, we've also increased our simultaneous substitution from 13.5 hours per week in our schedule to 15 hours so that is a net positive from a revenue perspective

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [30]

Terrific. Thanks very much

Operator   [31]

Dvai Ghose, Canaccord Capital

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [32]

I'm glad to hear that the situation in Calgary has been manageable for you. If I can ask some questions about your financial guidance as well as your dividend growth objective. First of all, you've increased your free cash flow guidance for this year by CAD40 million to CAD50 million. I'm wondering if you can tell us whether the driver is increased EBITDA assumption or reduced core CapEx assumptions? Obviously you've maintained your accelerated CapEx assumption of CAD100 million?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [33]

The driver behind that, Dvai, is just continued control in promotional pricing, some of the grandfather price increases that we did in the spring, and also just careful control of our base CapEx

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [34]

Okay. So it's a combination of EBITDA and CapEx?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [35]

There is some and CapEx and our guidance for the full year was what that we expected to see CapEx come down from last year. Last year we had CAD810 million in cable CapEx. This year, we expect it to be in the more of an area of CAD750 million to CAD760 million as we indicated before

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [36]

Right. But obviously you think it's going to be less than three months ago when you get the previous guidance? You've increased your guidance since the last call so I'm saying that you reduced that as well, right?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [37]

Yes. I would say that -- yes. Our view on the business is more optimistic in a number of areas than it was on the last call

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [38]

Okay. Fair enough. Now on the -- to go back to the Rogers spectrum sale, you've justified the accelerated CapEx by saying that the CAD500 million over three years will be funded through asset sales, but if we exclude the CAD300 million given that the Minister's comments seem to be fairly clear about who is allowed to own new entrant spectrum and who is not, i.e., incumbents, perhaps you can sell it to Verizon or another third-party, but if you look at all the other M&amp;A announcements year-to-date, including acquisition of ENMAX Envision and the CAD50 million in option proceeds, you have a net total of about CAD261 million, which is only about 50% of the CAD500 million, so are you prepared to fund the rest through leverage it required? I just want to confirm that rather than slowdown the accelerated CapEx?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [39]

Well first of all, I don't think we want to be hypothetical in terms of the spectrum and what will happen to the spectrum. There is a number of things there that still need to work out and so we're not going to address that as a hypothetical situation at this point. What I will say is that you need to recall that we've got CAD400 million of proceeds from the sale of Hamilton and we'll have CAD95 million in net proceeds from the assets swap, of course, that will come in the fall, so there's CAD500 million right there alone. And our debt leverage for the last 12 months is 2.2 times so we have the flexibility to go back and refinance or debt finance some of those acquisitions that we did as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [40]

No, that's fair. My only point was there is also CAD225 million going to ENMAX and CAD59 million or RCI TVtropolis, right?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [41]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [42]

But no. That's fair. My last point is on the dividend itself. Now I understand you take it as a percentage of core free cash flow as apart from the accelerated CapEx because if you include the accelerated CapEx, obviously the payout ratio in your new guidance is about 92% to 93%. You're not seeing [PSU] growth in either the satellite or the cable division and your accelerated CapEx, as per your guidance, goes up strongly this year from CAD100 million to CAD250 million. So it does sound like you're prepared if you include accelerated CapEx to have 100% plus dividend payout. I wanted to confirm that that's the case?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [43]

Well, we don't include the accelerated CapEx because you have to remember that that's cash on hand that we've received. So we're returning a portion of that cash to shareholders through dividends and looking at the base CapEx as the basis for how we look at the percentage dividend payout ratio

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [44]

Fair enough. And last question, if I could leave with this, presumably in order to sustain longer-term dividend growth you have to see a turnaround in PSU growth or declines as we are seeing today? Or do you think you can continue to enjoy EBITDA cash flow and dividend growth longer-term just through price increases and ARPU increases even if the base continues a little modestly by 1%, 1.5% a year?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [45]

Yes. And again, I would say that one of the things we talked about last time is that we've got 6.2 million RGUs in total. And our objective is not to lose more than 1% of that or 62,000 customers. We won't be -- 62,000 RGUs -- and we will not be near that this year so we're seeing a very small erosion in the base at the same time that were generating good profitability. And provided -- and that's what we said in terms of the dividends -- is provided favorable market conditions continue, we would like to see ourselves at that 10% rate but of course there's a number of things that we'll need to take into consideration. We didn't want to set an expectation absolutely of 10% but that's where our head is at and as we see from the announcement this week and Verizon, things can change rapidly in the industry and so we'll take all of that into account

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [46]

Thank you very much

Maher Yaghi, Desjardins

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [48]

Wanted just to go back on the margins on the cable side, which were very strong, and wanted to ask you about in MD&amp;A you talk about that in the fourth quarter you plan to offer contracts and equipment offers versus just being aggressive on providing equipments to customers as you did in the year-to-date? Can you talk a little bit about what do you mean by planned offers contracts in the fourth quarter? What does that entail in terms of promotional activity?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, Operations   [49]

It's Jay. Our research is clear. Our customers want choice. And later this summer, we'll be offering the choice of customers that subscribe with Shaw either without a service agreement or with a service agreement and really Canadians have been preconditioned to having the choice of offers that include hardware, so our service agreements, which we are launching later this summer, is -- it's as much about disciplined acquisition as it is about retention. This will be our first ever structured hardware deal including included model and it really allows us in a consumer-friendly way to continue our step-by-step approach to move away from promotional activity and towards value for money

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [50]

So that's a way to control your ARPU and just put the cost on equipment side, move towards that model as much as you can versus on the promotional side on the service contract?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, Operations   [51]

Yes. That's right. If you look at the continuation of our strategic plan, one of the four key areas of focus is customer profitability and what you've seen throughout the year is a step-by-step continuation of that approach. And this is the next logical step in terms of creating a disciplined acquisitions strategy along with the opportunity to upsell some of our existing customers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [52]

And so do you see this as a way for you to potentially continue to grow your margins? Or is it on a consolidated basis? Or is it meant to offset maybe the margins decline on -- or the EBITDA losses on customers who are not taking your cable service anymore? When I look at it, it seems like marginally it should contribute to consolidated EBITDA. That strategy. I was just wondering if on the whole when I look at it, do you expect margins to grow as you implement these new plans?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, Operations   [53]

There is a number of moving pieces in there. I agree with you that this move is on its own supportive of margins and profitability. If you look at the overall business, we really are seeing margin levels flat, in the range that they're in now, as our perspective today

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [54]

Okay. Great. And not to hit the same topic, but I was just wondering when you look at your capital allocation and we -- let's assume -- and as Brad said, we don't want to talk about hypotheticals here. Assuming that you will get the cash but is there a way to potentially get more for that spectrum if -- is there an option for you to -- if the deal somehow does not go through, potentially there other buyers in the marketplace if other players come to market. Is there a way for Shaw to change course and sell it to somebody else? The spectrum?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, Operations   [55]

Well first of all, it is our spectrum and we've got a hard agreement with Rogers, which gives them the right to buy that spectrum. And beyond that, we're not considering any alternatives today

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [56]

But do you have a way out of that contract? It's the option for them to buy this spectrum or is it -- if they have to file for approval, if they -- can you change the contract before they file for approval to change the spectrum ownership?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, Operations   [57]

No. It's an irrevocable option that Rogers has and ultimately the Minister will decide on the transfer of the spectrum license

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [58]

Okay. Thanks a lot

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jeff Fan of Scotiabank. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [2]

Hi. Thanks, and good afternoon. Couple of questions. First, maybe we can just identify some of the cost items in the quarter. There were some pressure on costs across various items. Wondering, Steve, if you could just give us a little bit of color on how we should see some of these cost pressures come off to help you achieve that 2% to 4% growth in EBITDA in 2012? Sorry, 2014

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [3]

Are you referring to cable or satellite or --?

Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [4]

More on the cable side

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [5]

More on the cable side? Okay

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [6]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [7]

In Q4 compared to last year we did have a small pickup from the [Ltif] fund which was about $2 million. We do have higher employee costs than last year. That's just growth in employees. We've grown about 300 employees this year and, of course, we have our merit increases. We also had top-up for merit as a result of the results for this year, which were very good

We had about CAD5 million of additional marketing costs in Q4 of this year and a portion of that was related to the Shaw Charity Classic. And then we have some higher programming amounts that are in the normal course and increased rates as contracts are being renewed. As well as that, there was a net reduction in EBITDA as a result of the divestiture of Hamilton and the purchase of Envision. So Hamilton was CAD11 million lower in EBITDA in the quarter and Envision was CAD6 million higher, so a net CAD5 million reduction as a result of that. The other thing in Q4 was that we had the flood costs which were about CAD3 millions as a one-time, non-recurring item

They represent service credits we provided to our customers, it was about a CAD200,000 revenue impact and the balance was a lot of activity that we did in the community to be out and about and servicing our customers locally. We brought in a lot of technicians from other provinces and we had a combination expenses and overtime expenses for that, to ensure that we were in communities, helping customers get back up as quickly as possible. So that's kind of the rundown of Q4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [8]

Okay. And just looking a ahead to next year, you recently put through some price increases. Can you just help us quantify what that impact and how it will flow through next year?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [9]

Well, we put through increases starting September 1 of CAD1 to CAD2 on the video side and CAD5 on Internet

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [10]

And do those go -- affect the entire base from the get-go?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, Operations   [11]

Jeff, it's Jay. They do. Obviously, they don't affect customers who are on a limited time promotional offer, but it does affect the base. We're not going to specifically quantify the dollar value of the rate increase because you've really got to put it in context with all of the other rate changes that happened throughout the year and the repackaging that happens in the markets. But the CAD5 is on every Internet customer and depending on whether you're on personal TV or basic, that's the difference between the CAD1 or CAD2 on TV

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [12]

Okay, all right. Thanks very much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [13]

Thanks, Jeff

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [14]

Thank you. Your next question comes from Vince Valentini of TD Securities. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [15]

Thanks. First, if I could package that rate increase question a different way, but look at your ARPU on a per -- on a PSU basis, it's up about just over 5%, Q4 this year versus Q4 last year. And I believe with each passing quarter you have more the promotional subs from legacy periods last year falling off. Should we, with those new rate increases, should we expect to see a similar sort of pacing continue of 5% improvement in ARPU each quarter?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [16]

Yes, I think you've got -- as we're saying, we've got the CAD1 to CAD2 in the video side, on the Internet side that would be about a 6% increase from last year, from fiscal 2013 in total ARPU compared to fiscal 2012, and so that's before the rate increase. So we'll see that pick up, as well. On digital phones, ARPU is pretty [say] around CAD30. I think that's a safe assumption, Vince

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [17]

Okay, great

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [18]

There will be some grandfathered packages which will come off in the spring of next year and they go back to the -- some of the simple bundling plans that we had, so there may be some further pickup from that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [19]

Okay. Another question's on the [SMEE] business. Can you give us any additional color there on what kind of traction you're getting, how big the revenue's you're getting and what type of growth you're seeing?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, Operations   [20]

Yes, Vince, Jay again. We sure can. The business is going very well. We're very pleased with the growth that, as we talked about in the 20% range year-over-year and very nice and consistent growth in monthly recurring revenue. Envision integration has gone extremely well. We've got some great people and great customers and some great fiber that have come along with that transaction. So we're about a CAD300 million business in fiscal 2013 and if you track that out, 20% for fiscal 2014 that's kind of the pace that we're going

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [21]

We should highlight just again for investors, on the Envision transaction we paid 11 times EBITDA which was a very fair price for it. It gave us connectivity, fiber connectivity to 560 buildings locally, into industrial parks where we don't have co-axe built out. We've got 46 of the top 100 customers in Calgary as a result of that on connectivity. The initial, as Jay said, is going very well. The initial ability to sell through our other services with these existing customers is working very well and we've seen some quick results on that. So we're very pleased about that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [22]

Okay, so just to clarify, the 20%, Jay, that's an organic growth number not including the Envision acquisition?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, Operations   [23]

20% does include Envision but the Envision acquisition is split over two years, right. We had four months in this year and eight months in next

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [24]

Okay. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [25]

Thank you. The next question comes from Glen Campbell of Bank of America. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [26]

Yes, thanks very much. On the cable revenues for the quarter, they do bounce around normally but there was a sequential drop, if I've got it right, from May 25 in Q3 to 8/18 in Q4. So I'm wondering if there are any one-time influences there other than the service credits you gave related to the floods? And then, starting off fiscal 2014, can you give us any color on what subscriber loadings have been like so far compared to the year-ago quarter? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [27]

Yes, I think the big difference, Glen, would probably be the divestments which were from Q4 versus Q3, which were CAD10 million alone

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [28]

Right, right, okay

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [29]

That's one of the big items. We had some positive pickup from rate increase, and then we had some negative growth compared to Q3 in some of the customer growth areas, and promotional discounts were relatively consistent between the two quarters

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [30]

Okay. And then on the subscriber loadings, post quarter end?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [31]

Sorry?

Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [32]

So can you give us any color on how subscriber loadings are going in cable after the fiscal year-end as compared to the year-ago quarter?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [33]

No, actually we've never wanted to introduce results sort of early in the quarter, so we'll come back to you with our results for Q1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [34]

Fair enough. Maybe I'll try another one then. On the Media side, with the framework proceeding, I guess, starting off and the government's, I guess, mandate to move towards pick-and-pay. This looks like a zero sum game between consumers and broadcasters and distributors. Do you see it that way or do you think there's the possibility of a win-win outcome on this?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [35]

Well, Glen, it's Brad here. I think a couple things. I think one is getting a clearer understanding of what the government and the Commission are really going to look at here from a point of view of pick-and-pay and what that looks like. I think for us, we wanted to make sure it's not disruptive to the consumer

It's very important that we've always looked at choice on the consumer side and work to do that but unfortunately over time, agreements and contracts and the ways the product was offered that it's been bundled. And I think it's an opportunity for us to really work with all the industry, because there's a lot of competing interests and a lot of different players, a big stake in the broadcasting industry and it's our goal to work with all players in finding the right level and the right solution, and how we get there. We hope at the end of the day there's a clear process for that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [36]

Okay. Thanks very much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [37]

Thank you. The next question comes from Drew McReynolds of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [38]

Thanks very much. Three quick ones for me. Just first on the Satellite segment, just maybe comment on the very minor subscriber erosion. Is it in part due to IPTV cannibalization and just wondering what the outlook would be with respect to bringing on the new satellite capability? And then, on the Media side, just wondering if you could provide some commentary on just how the market's tracking in Q1, which is, obviously, a seasonally strong quarter for television and if we can get some color on the conventional versus specialty ad dynamic, that would be great. Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, Operations   [39]

It's Jay again. In terms of Satellite subscribers, we were pleased with our subscriber numbers in Satellite and pleased with where revenue came in for the quarter. Obviously, we had some expenses that we need to grow into in terms of Anik G1 and we had some marketing expenses related to the launch of the new satellite. For sure, the competitive environment is accelerating greatly, largely East to West, with Atlantic Canada being the most intense competition that we've seen in a while. We're fortunate that our customers skew very heavily rural and we differentiate on an exceptional customer experience for that base. We're only so exposed, but there is no question that Eastern Canadian competition is heating up

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc - President, Shaw Media   [40]

Drew, it's Paul Robertson here, just commenting on the market dynamic on Media side. I'd say that the fall is shaping up through the first quarter is shaping up to be pretty much like the recent trends we've seen and pretty much as we've seen last year. In terms of the conventional television business, it will probably get a little bit of a boost because of the return of hockey. If you remember a year ago, we were in a hockey delay situation that came onstream later on, so the first quarter didn't really achieve any hockey revenues, I don't think. So we'll see a little bit of a bounceback there, so that will help conventional. Specialty's maintaining the same kind of pattern we expect which is kind of in the low- to mid-single-digits and we expect to take fully part in that, so that's pretty much the outlook

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [41]

Okay. No, that's helpful, Paul. Maybe just a final one. Just on your Internet initiatives, obviously, you're kind of bolstering your competitive position in the marketplace with offerings like WiFi, et cetera. Just wondering if you can look at your basic cable sub losses and how much you can attribute that to kind of cord cutting out there in the market, maybe provide some kind of commentary around that trend? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [42]

I think it's clear if you look at our numbers that we have, we're losing less customers than we're losing video customers. Certainly, we're growing our Internet standalone base. I think you've seen with some of the moves that have been made on pricing and other things, we're gaining some very profitable customers even in the Internet-only space. So I think you'll see some of that going forward. I think there's opportunity for us as a broadband Company to continue to drive Internet and look for new models to monetize on the Internet space

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [43]

Thank you very much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [44]

Thank you. Your next question comes from Tim Casey, BMO Bank. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [45]

Thanks. Can you talk a little about CapEx? You said a moderate decline before the accelerated capital program. And if we strip all that down, what are we really talking about here? You spent CAD867 million last year. Are you still guiding for something in the neighborhood of CAD150 million for the accelerated capital program?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [46]

No, for this year our guidance on accelerated capital is CAD250 million

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [47]

Pardon me. That's unchanged as I recall, right?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [48]

Where you'll see cable come in this year is about CAD750 million in base CapEx, and that's the, sort of as we've said, that's what we see the continuing number to be excluding the accelerated capital fund. And in there we've got some large projects including CAD60 million for Shaw core that we've been able to fit into that number beyond the CAD18 million that we spent last year. That's before the insurance recoveries

So we're doing a good job of managing within our means from a base CapEx point of view. And then we've got the CAD225 million for next year which is partly our data center, bandwidth upgrades and continuing to explore IPTV. And, of course, one of the big projects for us is a new billing system and a core transformation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [49]

Just briefly, Steve, what's the outlook for cash taxes next year? Are you fully cash taxable?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [50]

We're fully cash taxable now, Tim. The outlook for next year is, and that's why we mentioned that, so this year we had about CAD300 million of cash taxes. Next year it is, again, a little complicated to explain it in rates. We expect that to go up about CAD55 million to CAD70 million. There's two reasons for that. One is higher profitability because 2013 profitability was higher than 2012 and we work off of that. And the second reason is we were able to utilize some media capital loss-forwards which we've exhausted now. So that's the bulk of what we'll see in additional taxes

Thank you. The next question comes from Maher Yaghi of Desjardins. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [53]

Yes, thank you for taking my question. I'm just calling regarding your Internet offering. When I compare the Internet offerings that you guys have in cities like Calgary and Vancouver and I compare the speeds of upload, download with other companies, other cable companies in Canada, it seems your upload speeds continue to be much slower. Is there a particular reason why that is the case and are you spending some of the capital accelerated program here to increase those upload speeds and why is that happening?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [54]

Sure. So for sure a portion of the accelerated capital is around bandwidth upgrades, and bandwidth upgrades include a number of things that impact upload and download speed ands perhaps upload a little bit more than download in some instances. We understand the feature set comparison that you're doing on the website

We're pretty proud of the Internet product that we offer. The feedback we get from all of our market research suggests we're in a great space in the Internet space and we're not contemplating speed changes in the short term for upload or download speeds. So even though it may look that way from a specification point of view, certainly all of our market research indicates we're off, we're delivering a great Internet product

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [55]

Do you mean like you have the capability to switch on and increase those upload speeds at will right now or you need additional investment?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [56]

We're not contemplating changing our speeds. We could --

Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [57]

No, I'm trying to understand why -- what would it -- what it means when I look at these specifications, does it mean that the network is a little bit more congested on your side and that's why you're delivering a lower upload speed than other cable companies in Canada, or do you need to spend more money, more than basically because you have under invested maybe in the network compared to, let's say Videotron. I'm trying to understand a little bit the concept here

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [58]

Maher, it's Peter Bissonnette. We have the capability through our DNU to assign more spectrum, if you will, to both the up and the download, the downstream traffic. What we're offering right now is a well-balanced, very fast, very robust, where there is congestion we can deal with it on a hub-by-hub basis. So to the extent -- our customers are being well-served by the speeds that we are currently offering them there is no need to further invest. We know we have long-term opportunities, whether it's DOCSIS 3 to DOCSIS 3.1, to even put more punch if you will into the services that we offer our customers then those are available to us. Whether it also -- going into the future some of the things that we're doing on IPTV which is part of our accelerated capital, they also give us the means to do that. Right now, our customers are being well-served by the speeds that we give them, both up and down

Thank you. Your next question comes from Rob Goff of Euro Pacific. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Euro Pacific - Analyst   [61]

Thank you very much for taking my question. My question would be on the Internet side. If you could discuss the growth of the Internet-only subscribers, would that be primarily into the [SMEE] marketplace, would they be new to Shaw?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [62]

We certainly are doing very well in the Internet space in the SMEE marketplace. We have a fair amount of our student activity, actually this year it was probably the majority of our student activity, that came in by August 31 and clearly our student-based skews more heavily to Internet-only. And then I think some of the flexibility in pricing and packaging that we've provided our customers that previously maybe penalized customers and forced them into sort of double and triple play bundles, some of that has gone away, so customers are naturally finding their way to the product set that makes most sense for them

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Euro Pacific - Analyst   [63]

Thank you. And if I could switch to telephony for the moment, are you running up against wireless local loop to a greater or lesser extent on the telephony side?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [64]

Did you hear that?

Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc - President, Shaw Media   [65]

Wireless local loop?

Rob Goff,  Euro Pacific - Analyst   [66]

Yes, in terms of the momentum on the telephony adds, do you find you're competing more with wireless local loop?

Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc - President, Shaw Media   [67]

Not in a meaningful way. Our sense of the home phone business is going is, I think we're seeing that our growth has become more modest in this quarter and I think that likely will be directional going forward. There's a number of factors there. We shift share with our primary competitor often on price, as the marketplace has become more disciplined there's just been lots of that going on in the marketplace. And clearly the home phone bucket isn't getting bigger, so it's -- I think if you look at the -- I think we're going to see growth in phone. I think we're going to see a more modest growth like you saw in the quarter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Euro Pacific - Analyst   [68]

Operator   [69]

Thank you. The next question is a follow-up from Jeff Fan of Scotiabank. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [70]

Thanks for taking the follow-up. So very quickly. Rogers this morning talked a little about the cable business, saying that their Internet gross profit dollars now exceeding their television gross profit. Just wondering if, Steve, you can shed some light on how you guys look on that front with respect to gross profit for those two services. And also maybe comment on the gross profit dollar per sub on TV, whether given the rise in programming costs you guys are seeing enough price increases to hold that relatively stable?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [71]

They're all profitable businesses for us. That's one of the reasons that we've taken a view in looking at total RTUs as opposed to looking at individual products. So as we said before, we do expect to lose video customers. That's natural here as a result of competition and core shaving and other alternatives for them. But when we look at it, our main focus is being a broadband Company, broadband still has very high incremental margins because you're running it down a fixed cost pipe. And so we're very pleased to see the shift to broadband, and certainly there is a big difference in profitability there. So we would take a broadband customer any day over a video customer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [72]

Have you seen a cross over, though, from a gross profit perspective in terms of TV and Internet?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [73]

Internet would have a higher gross profit

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [74]

Right, but overall for your business?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [75]

Overall -- overall, we're probably close

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [76]

Okay. And then on the individual subscriber on television, content cost is going up but you guys are, obviously, raising rates, as well. From a gross profit perspective on TV sub, are you guys able to hold that relatively stable given those two changes?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [77]

One of the great things about vertical integration is that we all have some stick in the game here and it's helped us to be able to negotiate between each other fair rates and that's been helpful. We don't -- if you look to the future, where the future really lies is on broadband and the profitability of broadband. We're still going to see, as Jay said, slower growth in phone, but the growth will come from business in that segment. It won't be a residential product as much. While we may see some core cutting on the residential side, we've got the business side which is doing very well on phone

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [78]

Okay. And just quick follow-up on the WiFi. You guys gave some stats on subscribers that are using WiFi. Wondering if it's too early or what you can share with us the churn profile of those subscribers that use the WiFi versus those that don't and can you also share some data on how much they're using in terms of gigabytes or megabytes consumed?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [79]

They're all pointing at me to be the WiFi guy. (laughter) Looks like I have the information. I think a couple of numbers on that. One is I think we're seeing about half the churn rate once the customer's hooked up to WiFi. And so we're very pleased with that and that continues. And from a data point of view, we certainly believe we're starting to become part of the ecosystem on the wireless side, and I think there's approximately 600 to 650 MB per customer on the usage basis per month

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [80]

And in terms of network strain on that, that's a very small amount in the overall scheme of things

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [81]

Okay. That's great. Thanks very much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [82]

Thank you. We have one more question from Glen Campbell. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [83]

Yes, thanks very much for fitting me in. On the Satellite side, we've seen OpEx rise sequentially this quarter and also the last quarter. You mentioned the higher transponder costs. How much one-time expense would you say is in there related to marketing or other things in that Satellite number? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [84]

Marketing would be a couple of million dollars and we need to look at that as we balance the year here. We need to make sure that Shaw Direct has a profile in the market and that's part of the way that we're going to monetize the additional channels that we have

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [85]

Okay. Great. Any one-timish items on the Media side in expenses?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - CFO   [86]

No, nothing on the Media side

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions)
 Jeff Fan with Scotiabank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [2]

A couple of quick questions. First, on the satellite business. Obviously, you guys are going through a little bit of an adjustment there with launch of additional content and the new satellite. Wondering if you can just help us out with where you think the long-term margins for satellite could settle -- where it could settle? And also, just give us a bit of a review of the exposure of your satellite subscribers, i.e., the percentage of subscribers that you think are in more rural and less competitive markets?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP Corporate Development and CFO   [3]

Why don't I start, Jeff. Really, the big difference from last year -- we were at CAD74 million in EBITDA going down to CAD66 million -- is really two things. It's the transponder cost, and in our last press release, we indicated that they're CAD2 million a month, so that people could model that. And then, in addition to that, we have network fee increases. And so, that really -- there are some other things that net there through, but that really accounts for the difference

In terms of the next quarter, we expect a marginal improvement. We do have some rate and packaging changes that we are going to be making, and we are also going to be taking advantage of revenue from rental equipment from customers. So, I think we were kind of surprised at where analysts came out on this, and there is really not much change from Q4 to Q1 either

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and COO   [4]

Yes, and it's Jay, following up on Steve's comments. I think you start to build from there. Your question about exposure, Jeff -- for sure, the majority of our customers are rural, although we're certainly not immune to competition as these numbers suggest. And in general terms, if you want to go one-third/two-thirds, with two-thirds rural in terms of our customer base nationally, I think that's the right way to think about the Business. Because we're primarily rural, the losses that we sustained were competitive, not substitution

That having been said, we have a new management team; we're completely focused. We're focused on rural and underserved communities. We have got a great product offering. We have strong customer sat scores continuing, and so, I think we have an opportunity to rebuild from here

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [5]

Okay, great. Then, just to ask a more big-picture question. If we look at what is going on in the US with respect to the whole consolidation trend, given where the industry is going, competition, higher content costs and technology spending, I guess there is an argument there that where greater scale within the cable industry certainly helps offset some of those trends: higher cost, content, and technology spend. Just curious where you guys stand on that -- whether you think some of those trends are really going to affect the Canadian market as well?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [6]

Jeff, it is Brad here. Just a couple of things on that. One, I think there is certain advantages to scale and size. I think from that point of view, you're going to look at opportunities

But I also look just where Shaw is at: Our complete focus on what we need to do in regards to our activity, and the competitive nature we are in and the fast-changing industry we're in. We need the attention of the team, and focus on operations

I think, at the end of the day, you look at where consolidation could or couldn't happen, and we are very comfortable with what we have now. We're very focused in western Canada from a cable point of view, and if it goes beyond that, we can look at media and satellites. But we're comfortable where we are, and we're really focused on what we need to do

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [7]

Okay, thanks, Brad

Operator   [8]

Vince Valentini with TD Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [9]

A couple things. First, if I take just your cable revenue over your average subscribers, it looks like the ARPU was up just over 8% year over year, but I don't think that's quite the case because you have got the Envision in there. Can you help us understand what sort of the underlying consumer ARPU picture is? And can you give us any color on the Envision revenue in the quarter, and what kind of revenue per customer you get in that segment?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP Corporate Development and CFO   [10]

So, Vince, first of all, on acquisitions and divestments, if you look at quarter over -- Q1 over Q1, we are down CAD10 million as a result of the sale of Hamilton, and we're up CAD5 million as a result of the sale of Envision, just on the disposition. On the business side, we've been able to integrate Envision, and we're actually ahead of our expectations for what that is doing for our Business overall. There is additional revenue that doesn't translate into ARPU from carrier and wholesale sales, and other elements of our Business that make it difficult to do that ARPU calculation

What I will say is: On the video ARPU side, we are seeing that as just over CAD62. That is up from an average of CAD60 last year. That is partly the rate increase and partly some of the video on demand. And on Internet, we're up about CAD4 on average from last year, and that was the CAD5 rate increase that we put through. Our Internet product ARPU, just to remind people, is CAD54, which is still a tremendous bargain when you consider that our average customer is using 52 gigabits per month on that service

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [11]

I'm sorry, Steve, the CAD10 million and CAD5 million, those are revenue figures or EBITDA?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP Corporate Development and CFO   [12]

EBITDA

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [13]

I thought so

The second one: just an accounting one, sorry, but there is a pretty big change in depreciation from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. It dropped CAD30 million. Is there anything unusual there, or should we look at Q1 as a new normal run rate?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP Corporate Development and CFO   [14]

I would say look at Q1 as a new normal run rate. We did do some adjustments. One of the biggest ones is that we were depreciating fiber over 15 years. The standard in the industry is 15 to 30 years; 15 is obviously a short period, so we moved that to 20, and that affects amortization

We made some small changes in other areas like vehicles and modems. We've also moved our DCT -- we had DCTs initially at two years for deferred equipment revenue and deferred equipment costs, and we've moved that to three years with the experience we've had with how solid the gateway is now and how solid the overall platforms are

So, in total for the year, you can expect that that will amount to approximately CAD100 million pre-tax, and then take taxes of CAD30 million, and say net income of CAD70 million. So, I hope that helps with your EPS calculation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [15]

No, that's very helpful

And let me try to ask one maybe a little more interesting non-accounting question. Wi-Fi: Any update there on the usage stats? And I think last quarter you talked a little bit about the churn reduction you get for the people who use it. Can you give us an update on how that's trending?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [16]

Sure, Vince, it's Brad. I think we're still seeing the benefits of Wi-Fi on the churn side, and we still are excited about the opportunity because you look at, and I think we've mentioned about -- customers are using about 1 gig of data a month on the Wi-Fi service. When I look at the sheer amount of time they're spending on it, there is tremendous value to get economical high-speed service outside of your home on a value add is an incredible proposition. And when we look at what the usage is and what people are using it for: video, streaming, face chat -- or face time, sorry, I don't got all the words right, but it is --- so it's going very well

We still continue to focus on our municipal build. We just got the city of Calgary, as you know, and we are continuing to work with about another other -- a total of 90 municipalities. And we continue to see customers sign up in a significant way day in and day out, and devices are even growing faster than that

So, we are very comfortable with where we are at, and we are still very focused on building the network -- building and executing sign-ups in regards to customers. And so, that's really our focus in the short term, but we are still very pleased with how it is all going

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [17]

Okay, guys. Thanks so much

Phillip Huang with Barclays

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [19]

Question on -- more on the wireless side. I know Shaw is currently focused on using Wi-Fi to extend your services outside of the home. But with the government looking to regulate wholesale wireless rates, I was wondering whether this could create some opportunity or optionality for Shaw? Was wondering if maybe you could talk a little bit about thoughts on this development? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [20]

Phillip, it's Brad here. We are very comfortable with where we are at now. We love our broadband play. We love the extension of broadband with Wi-Fi. We think it is tremendous economical value to our customers, and you're going to continue to see us focus there

What's changed or what actually is going to change or what that structure is -- hard to know where things are going to go. But we're very focused on what we're doing, and we have a big commitment in Wi-Fi. It is a little bit of gold rush, so we're pushing, as well as we can, to make sure we execute and deliver. And you are going to see us continue to focus on that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [21]

Got it, and a quick follow-on on the over the top. There has certainly been a lot more talk about cables launching their own OTT service lately. Was wondering if you could give us an update on your thoughts on that, both in terms of the opportunity to potentially grow through maybe a bundle created with an over-the-top service, as well as the potential re-pricing or cannibalizing -- cannibalization impact on your existing subs if you were to go down that path, and what you might be able to do to mitigate that?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [22]

Okay, Phillip, couple of things on that. I think, one, for sure is: With our TV-everywhere strategy authenticated back to the cable and satellite customer, or IPTV customer, certain value in that, and we like that proposition, but we know that is not the only solution. I think you are having a number of -- and not knowing where the other industry players are at

But everyone is talking streaming: What other opportunities are there? Where do you play in the OTT space, or not. And I think that has been a constant for the last little while. And we will update you as we go along, but I think everyone is looking at where to be able to play in that space and how you can be successful

Great, thanks very much

Drew McReynolds, RBC Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [25]

Just I guess for you, Paul, just on the media side: I think when you strip out the adjustment, I think results were a little bit below our expectations. And I know it was a tough comp. Maybe could you comment on just the trends you are seeing in specialty advertising and conventional advertising?

Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and President, Shaw Media   [26]

Sure, Drew. Yes, the first quarter, the data we have is that from an industrywide standpoint it was a little softer a quarter from an air-time revenue standpoint than we'd seen a year ago. And when you strip it down, it really came from one market in particular, which was BC, that was down sharply from last year

And analyzing that further, it was an election year in BC with a lot of money garnered due to provincial election. So, there was a -- from a comparison standpoint, it really was a down trend of -- but really isolated to BC

So, we also -- a year ago there was no hockey in the mix, and this year hockey is back in. So, I guess our expectation is that we will start to see a more positive trend in the second quarter from an industrywide standpoint, but that is the general trends that we're looking at

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [27]

Okay. And just on the subscriber revenue side of the equation, obviously there is a lot of focus out there on programming cost inflation for satellite and cable. Just wondering, given your portfolio of channels, obviously ex the sports genre, no doubt the best in Canada, just wondering: Your degree of pricing power and the ability to put through rate increases -- is it changing at all? Is it eroding? Just if you can talk to that dynamic as you kind of look forward?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [28]

You're asking on the media side or on the cable side?

Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [29]

Yes, in terms of your broadcasting channels

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [30]

Subscriber rate increases

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [31]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and President, Shaw Media   [32]

Okay, yes, it's Paul here. When we first came in, we did longer-term arrangements that had some built-in increases year on year. And so, we've enjoyed, generally speaking, a pretty good growth trend on revenue on our deals with the other BDUs. So, that's what we've been seeing. You get some erosion of subscribers that offsets those original numbers, but for the most part, we are seeing sort of mid- to high-single digits is our expectation on subscriber revenues

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [33]

Okay, okay. Thanks very much for that. And just kind of a more boring question here: In terms of the annual merit adjustments that you allude to in your MD&amp;A, just flesh out -- are these significant in the quarter, and is this just a Q1 event that routinely happens on an annual basis or is there something else going on?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP Corporate Development and CFO   [34]

No, you are exactly right, Drew. This is a Q1 event that happens. And I would say our -- it is both the increase from additional employees over last year, which was not substantial, and then just the overall merit increases are normally a first-quarter event. And also in the first quarter is normally where we see our network fees and content costs going up, just by virtue of the way the contracts are done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [35]

Okay, that's great. Thanks very much

Operator   [36]

Tim Casey, BMO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [37]

Could you talk a little bit about the timing of rate increases through the year, and whether we should expect any moderation or acceleration in revenue growth outside of the -- on the cable business? I'm assuming that basic subscriber losses, your expectation is they would remain at about the rate you lost in the first quarter?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and COO   [38]

Sure, Tim. It's Jay. Yes, we're on a September -- generally on a September rate change environment in terms of our existing base. And I think you can kind of annualize that going forward. Throughout the year, there is a series of pricing and packaging changes that happen to help us be more competitive in the marketplace. But in terms of the base, if you think about September

On the cable side, we do have some grandfathered packaging where there's customers who are paying less than retail rates, and we've grandfathered them for a few years. So, from time to time, we do some mid-year cleanup of the grandfathered rates, but we're largely in a September rate increase cycle

In terms of your conversation -- your question about subscriber losses, it's interesting. We've been right around the same level for the last four quarters. So, I think you can see a sense of what would appear to be a constant trend

What's interesting is on the video side of the business is our competitive losses have dropped significantly over that period of time, and you're really starting to see equal pressure, competitive and substitution in both the video and phone side of the business on cable

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [39]

Are you implying you are seeing -- you are starting to see real cord-cutting losses out there now?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and COO   [40]

Yes, I think if you look at substitution, generally customers have choices, and we're not seeing it in the satellite business and we're not seeing it on the home Internet business. Customers have choices, and I'm not sure we would use that word, but for sure, some of our voice customers are staying with us and disconnecting their voice, and for sure, some of our video customers are staying with us on Internet and moving to other ways to receive video within the whole ecosystem

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [41]

And it's not just about rate increases, Tim. Our promo costs are well in line, and we're managing the promotional environment here, and it is a stable market, so that helps as well

And also, when you move into an environment where you don't have promo hoppers, you get an advantage from significant lower bad-debt exposure. And we are well, well below 1% in our bad debt in cable, and below that in satellite, which is an excellent performance

And it really ties back to the quality of the customers, when you look at people who aren't promo hopping and are staying with you. So, I think that is a focus as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP Corporate Development and CFO   [42]

And I think on top of that, Tim, you have -- in the market here, you have mobile, or ILEC competitors with certain offers, and one out there that is pretty aggressive at CAD10 for a home phone. And so, it's going to drive awareness from the consumer point of view, and they're going to make choices around that

 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie - Analyst   [45]

I wanted to ask you a question on the Internet side of things. You spoke, Brad, about the Wi-Fi value proposition. One thing that is interesting to me is you put through a rather large price increase through the Internet side. And what I'm wondering is: Is there anything that you can share with us on the churn metric, on the customer mix metric? Anything like that -- just sort of traditional wireless-type metrics that might help us understand whether the ROI case for Wi-Fi is improving, given the moves that you made? And whether there is a suggestion or a look forward that we can have that revenue and margin improvements might come from the moves that you made in Internet?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [46]

Well, a couple of things, and maybe the guys will add in here. I think, certainly, just as you said, a CAD5 increase and to see the impact it's had and the customer and the reaction has been, I think, very positive. I think customers are finding that if you want to get into me on wireless metrics and stuff, I wouldn't be the guy to talk to about that. (multiple speakers)

Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie - Analyst   [47]

Maybe I can clarify, and I want to make sure I'm clear. So, in the Internet side of things, are you seeing an increase in churn as a result of the price increase? And if you are, is that an increase in churn at the low-ARPU side of the equation, which might be acceptable if you are actually keeping more of those high-ARPU customers? That's kind of the stuff I'm looking for

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and COO   [48]

Greg, it's a real easy answer: There is no increase in Internet churn as a result of the price increase

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie - Analyst   [49]

Okay, so, if we saw an Internet number on the positive side of about 3,000, which was slightly lower than the street expected, is there a trend that you can point to that is occurring there? If there was no increase in churn, does that naturally mean that your gross adds are declining?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and COO   [50]

Yes, if you want to talk about the trends in the Internet business, and I think -- let's start with a background point to begin with. I think the Internet product is fundamentally changing

If you think about our Internet product in 2009, we sold an Internet product into a customer's home that may even have been plugged in -- a modem may even have been plugged in physically to a desktop. There was a router in the home that was supplied by the customer, and there may have been a laptop, potentially a very early smartphone attached to that. If you think about the network experience that we're providing customers today, with multiple devices in the home, access to everything, Steve talked about some of the usage, extension of 30,000 additional hot spots where customers go as part of the package, it's hard to look through pricing and packaging on the Internet through the lens of the Internet in 2009

If you look at our Internet subscriber numbers, we have, for the last number of quarters, we had one -- we had a nice uptick in Q4 with our students, but we've been in single-digit positive for most of the rest of the way, and that's not a number that we are happy with. We clearly want to do better than that

If you ask the mechanics of that, remember our primary competitor, as they buy business with free TVs and free iPads, it's not just the TV business, you have to pull the Internet with it, in order to receive the gift. And so, start with that level of movement on the Internet business, and then you start to rebuild back from there. I think for sure going forward, this is a big part of our future, and we have given clear direction to our marketing team that this is our singular focus, is to use our Internet experience to grow our Internet business

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie - Analyst   [51]

So, then just to be clear, it seems like there hasn't been a lot of change in the internal metrics on Internet as a result of the price increase, and the reason I ask is it is a rather large price increase. One would have assumed there was churn risk in taking that price increase, yet -- at least I'm thinking there is this opportunity to actually upgrade the sub base that might supersede that risk or justify that risk. And I'm trying to figure out whether anything is changing or maybe it's too early. Maybe we're a quarter too early, maybe we will see some movement in the second quarter, or am I just wrong? Is this just a price increase that's being passed through, and everyone's taking it?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [52]

As I said before, Greg, CAD54 for usage, as Jay is pointing to, when you look back a couple of years, people weren't using 52 gigabits on average per month. It was a very different service. We see people who are continuing to upgrade their service. So, within a flat RGU number, there are people who are upgrading and paying more for their Internet

And I think it's what you don't see in the east is that it's early days for us on Wi-Fi. We did a slow -- a quiet launch there. We wanted to make sure we had an extensive network that our customers would be able to enjoy and value when we came out of the gate. We started that in November. We've run some Christmas campaigns

And so, we're really at the beginning stages now of educating our customers on Wi-Fi in a more substantial way. And just having them understand what a true differentiator -- never mind the speed of the broadband experience, but what a true differentiator that is in this market, and that we're one of the leaders in North America here

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie - Analyst   [53]

Or maybe it's just that everybody out west is richer than us poor people in the east. (laughter) Okay. I appreciate your answers. Thanks, guys

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [54]

Well, the tax rate is lower anyways

 Matthew Nicknam,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst   [57]

Couple on commercial, if I could. One, if you can give us an update on the absolute revenue contribution from commercial in the quarter, and whether you saw any competitive responses from your telco peers there? And then more broadly, any color you can give on what percentage share of the commercial market you estimate you have in your footprint, and where that can go over time? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP Corporate Development and CFO   [58]

I will start just with the number there. We are not breaking out business right now as a separate number. We've said it's CAD300 million last year, and we expect about 20% growth this year. And we're tracking well to that number

And, as I said, the Envision acquisition is going very well for us, with the 560 buildings that we acquired, 46 of the top 100 customers in Calgary, and we're being able to leverage that to sell other services and business. But we don't have a specific number right now

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and COO   [59]

Yes, and I don't know that we would want to size the price in terms of the total market share. Obviously, it is pretty clear the size of the western Canadian market. We play in a subsection of that. We've been very successful in small, and are continuing to focus on small. And we're increasingly having an awful lot of success in medium, and so you really need to look at the sizes of those marketplaces to get a sense of the opportunity. There is no question we're -- there's lots of room for us in market position

And just building on what Steve said about the Envision acquisition, things have gone really well for us with Envision. It certainly has significantly strengthened our relationship in the oil and gas vertical; we've been selling both voice and data. Shaw services very well within the Envision base, and the Envision team that has come over has helped us close a number of deals with customers that we haven't previously had. So, a very positive add to the Business

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Matthew Nicknam,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst   [60]

Just anything on competitive responses from telco peers?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [61]

We continue to have a very competitive environment in small. I think in the medium space, you're seeing more differentiated competition

 Matthew Nicknam,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst   [62]

 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [64]

Please don't tease us about your tax rate in Alberta. I live in Montreal, so -- (laughter)

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP Corporate Development and CFO   [65]

Sorry

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [66]

I'm going to cry soon here

On the subscriber front, in video, you talked about potential cord cutting happening in some of your subscriber base. Is that really, you believe, the reason why we're seeing this year-on-year increase in net addition and net losses in the subscriber numbers? Is that the main reason?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and COO   [67]

I'm not sure I see where you're going. I understand you're using a comp in Q1 of FY13 and 24. Q2 FY13 was 29.4. We were 27 in Q3. We were 29.5 in Q4, and we were 29.6 in Q1. So, I don't really see a shift in trend in the losses

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP Corporate Development and CFO   [68]

It's not so much a shift in trend. The sort of studies that we have seen is that we are still in the early days of cord cutting, and it's still having a very marginal impact. So, we see numbers like 1.5% to 3.5% per year. If you take that across our base of video subscribers, that's about 50,000 that you would see as a result of cord cutting. Then the rest is potentially more of a competitive loss

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [69]

That's very helpful, got it, that makes sense. And the reason I was asking that question is: I'm trying to assess maybe where is the turning point in terms of, like, when we get smaller losses on the TV side. That's what I was going for

And in terms of the high-speed net additions, can you share with us how many small business lines were connected during the quarter? I assume you're starting to see quite a fair bit more of that business coming your way. You've been focusing on this for a while now, and can you talk a little bit about the prospects for help coming from small- and medium-size businesses on that front?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [70]

Yes, we've been a primary -- we've had a primary focus on selling Internet to small business for six or seven years at this point. We had kind of a stable quarter in Q1, in terms of what our Internet adds were, and so I think -- is their continued opportunity there? Absolutely there is continued opportunity there, but I don't think you'll necessarily see a shift. Clearly if you look at -- if you're trying to get at the split of the Internet business, it's clear that we had a small single-digit residential loss in the quarter. I think you can probably scope back into that what the numbers look like

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP Corporate Development and CFO   [71]

But again, as we said before, you need to look at overall RGUs, and not just focus on video too much because you have to remember that there is an opportunity here with a very differentiated service from a speed point of view and with Wi-Fi to be able to lead with an Internet product. And that is a potential shift in focus. So, as millennials cord cut, they are also the people who are looking for the very best Internet service that they can get, both in and out of the house. So, that is a balancing factor here that, again, as we continue to look at the evolution of this business going forward, it is -- we are moving from video to broadband in the home and outside the home

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions)
 We'll go ahead with our first question from Jeff Fan from Scotiabank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [2]

Thanks, and good afternoon everyone. My question is on the Wi-Fi. It's been a couple of quarters since you guys gave us some metrics on penetration of how many subscribers you think are using it, and maybe usage. Wondering if you can just give us a bit of an update on that, and also the churn impact that you are seeing with the Wi-Fi product?
 And then the second part to that is in the US we recently saw the SEC open a lot more spectrum specifically for Wi-Fi. I'm just wondering on the spectrum front, whether you guys think that the Canadian government is open to doing that, whether there's been any discussions from you with them that would indicate that would allow you to get basically more capacity onto that network down the road? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [3]

Thanks, Jeff. Brad here. I guess a couple things on Wi-Fi. On the churn side, we certainly still continue to see the benefit as customers sign up and use the service, and we continue to build out on our plan

Our strategy is to continue to build the network, continue to make sure customers do sign up. I can tell you that as we go along here, we're extremely pleased with how customers are responding and reacting to the service, but I'd also say that we continue to see, I think, devices outpace the number of customers coming on

I think when they realize that they can get more than one device on, they're doing that, which is a real benefit, I think, for them, and a real retention factor, and a real value factor. So we're seeing that, and we're comfortable, we're seeing same kind of trends

I think we would be somewhere above 400,000 in customers on the service, and we continue to make sure we have more awareness around that. And you're going to actually probably see us try to ensure that customers know it's there

And the fact is I think once you sign up and you never have to sign up again to the service we have people that go out to Eastern Canada and come back and bang, their Wi-Fi pops up, it's right there, I got Wi-Fi here, I got here. We're getting a lot of feedback, I lot of noise about the real benefits of it, people finding it and using it and we're certainly very pleased

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [4]

And hello, Jeff, it's Peter Bissonnette

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [5]

Hi Peter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [6]

On the SEC's decision recently to expand the amount of spectrum in the 5-gigahertz, as well as the outdoor power associated with that, we are very aware of what's going on in the US, and we've met with various Industry Canada representatives, both on their technical side as well as their administrative side of the industry Canada. And we've expressed a desire to see the same decision come from Industry Canada for Wi-Fi in Canada because there's just -- it will become ever more important for us to have that spectrum available for us, just in terms of making the predominant, if you will, Wi-Fi or wireless spectrum that's used by our Canadians

And with the 400,000 that Brad just mentioned, we're seeing much, much more awareness of the use of Wi-Fi. The spectrum really follows that. So we're going to do everything we can to encourage the Industry Canada to do the same thing in Canada as they have in the FCC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [7]

Maybe just one quick follow-up. We ask this of the wireless industry all the time, but based on the 400,000 customers that you see and looking at the usage pattern, how far a road map do you think based, on the existing on-license that's out there today is available to you to ensure that there's no interference issues and the quality of the experience is still going to be very high?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [8]

Jeff, I guess a couple things. One is being a managed Wi-Fi network we usually take advantage of all of the spectrum available to us, and I think that's to our advantage. I think for us it becomes, from a capacity point of view, you look at it, and with that I think the managing of the network helps, but also when you look at things like we recently opened up the Olympics for Wi-Fi, we threw it open for everyone in Western Canada, we saw a huge pop in data usage, the network handled it very, very reasonably, no issues

We're still at a low throughput for all Wi-Fi customers, and we have some upside there. So we're sensitive to that. We realize that there's not an never-ending spectrum there, but that's why it's even your previous question on spectrum is important to kind of move Wi-Fi along, and hopefully with the steps that the US has made, Canada will look at that

So we're still comfortable that we have spectrum available there. We're seeing people use it in ways that huge amount of data, and yet we've certainly been able to manage any of those areas that are heavily used

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [9]

Okay. Thanks, guys

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [10]

Thank you. Our next question comes from Vince Valentini from TD Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [11]

Yes, thanks very much. Question on the operating costs. So you seem to be sort of hinting at some sort of belt-tightening activities. I'm wondering if you can flesh that out in any more detail. Is something, a big restructuring cost coming, or this just looking for best practices and finding ways to be more efficient without having to spend a lot of money?
 And I guess I'd segue that question with the second quarter results. They seem to be quite a bit further down in terms of operating costs, or operating costs were up in the cable segment in the second quarter with increased promotions. Wondering if that's just temporary, if there any timing issues, or is this a new trend in the market?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [12]

Vince, I'll take the first one. We've been constantly looking at operational efficiencies and execution and delivering, and in this day and age of the cable company and what we're dealing with. So you're going to continue to see those things

I think we have some good plans in place. And we're looking, no stone's unturned here as we continue to make sure, and ultimately you want to deliver, as we look at things, if customer experience is so important, we want a structure that absolutely delivers that and gives us bandwidth to continue to grow in scale and have flexibility

And so we're continuing to look at how we operate, how we function, how we drive the business and where we're not driving it, and what things we need to do to better prepare ourselves or better organize ourselves. So it's a constant thing we're looking at. So it's something that you're going to continue to see going forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP Corporate Development &amp; CFO   [13]

In terms of the cost structure, Vince, in Q1 in cable our cost structure was CAD439 million, and we're up CAD5 million to CAD441 million in Q2. And really, that's a few odds and sods here, mostly increased programming costs from annual rate increases and some other various expenses

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [14]

Sorry Steve, I kind of misspoke. In addition to that, the cable revenue in the second quarter was down from the first quarter. And in the MD&amp;A you cited some sort of increased promotional activity. So I guess I was referring to that as much as I was the operating cost. Can you comment at all on how sustainable that is?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP &amp; COO   [15]

Yes, Vince. It's Jay. We certainly understand the question, and let us reconcile what you saw in Q2 cable revenue. We had not gone more aggressive in our promotions, and we've had really a very consistent promotioning offering throughout the fiscal year

As you know our focus is not in chasing deep promotional business, and we're focused on offering value and choice for our customers. Last year we moved to three-month promotions, and were there for a number of months. And it was clear the market didn't follow us

So we, in September, moved to six-month promotions, which is fine and certainly works with our customer profitability approach. But we just ended up as a result with the timing issue in Q2 where nobody was coming off promotions. So you had your normal amount of adds for that three-month period (technical difficulties) any offsets. In Q3 the pluses and minuses align again, and revenue comes back nicely

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [16]

That's great, thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [17]

Thank you. Our next question comes from Glen Campbell from Banc of America

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [18]

Yes, thanks very much. So a couple questions. First, in media you mentioned the, I guess, advertising revenue displaced by the Olympics. Could you give us a rough sense of how much that might have been?

Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP &amp; Presdient Shaw Media   [19]

It's Paul here. Yes, it was less than CAD10 million in terms of the shift. And I think what was a bit surprising for us was it came in -- the shift came in very late in the quarter

And so there seemed to be a lot of inventory available to give access to new advertisers and to augment the buys of existing advertisers. So we were kind of surprised the amount of revenue that re-routed late in the quarter, and that's kind of -- that took us by surprise a little bit

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [20]

Okay, thanks. And then another one on Wi-Fi. We've seen some US operators go ahead with this home spot strategy where the customer gateways are opened up for access to other customers. Is this something you've thought about, and if so can you talk about the pros and cons from a Shaw perspective?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [21]

Well, I think as you look at it, it certainly becomes an opportunity to expand your current public and private Wi-Fi network. I think there's, with the technology the way it is, it's something that we continue to look at

I think it makes sense that it should be part of your Wi-Fi plans, and listen, Wi-Fi is going to be so important in the home you need to have a quality network, you need to have quality modem, and that's really something we're focused on is to have quality on the levels of whatever network we're developing through Wi-Fi. And that's where we feel we're in a good spot, and that's what we're going to continue to do

But it is an option for us. We still continue to build out the public and private Wi-Fi. That is our focus, but we're well aware of what's going on in the US

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [22]

Okay, thanks. And one last one, if I may. Very strong sub performance in the quarter on cable. Could you give us a sense of whether this is due to churn reduction or better loadings, and to the extent this is repeatable through the balance of the year?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP &amp; COO   [23]

Sure, it's Jay again. Certainly the turnaround in the cable numbers were absolutely caused by fewer disconnects, and the marketplace is settling down. We're experiencing the benefits of many quarters of lighter promotional aggressiveness, which obviously helps you on your churn. And the lower churn from our Wi-Fi-enabled internet customers now when you multiply the difference against the household numbers that Brad talked about that are now using the service, it's now enough to have a directional impact on the quarterly numbers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [24]

That all makes sense. It's quite sudden, the change. That's why I guess the question. So I'm just wondering what was different this quarter?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP &amp; COO   [25]

The -- I, speaking plainly, we believe our differentiated internet product and all of the advertising that came around it has given us some tailwinds, and we're having greater success in the marketplace

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [26]

Okay, thanks very much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [27]

Thank you. Our next question comes from Phillip Huang from Barclays

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [28]

Yes, thanks. Good afternoon guys. Just to follow up with the prior question there, wanted to ask, certainly it was a positive surprise for me to see the strong cable subscriber results. I was wondering whether you guys are seeing any additional promotions from the competition at all, perhaps in response to the increased presence of Wi-Fi?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP &amp; COO   [29]

I think you have probably seen that there's been a little bit of 15, 15, 15-plus in the marketplace, whether it be for 6 or 12 months, or any little push at the end of our primary competitor's quarters. We're focused on delivering value and choice, and so we're not going to -- I mean, we have some experience a couple years ago here with deep short-term discounts, and when you look at that kind of activity and its churn characteristics and its cost of acquisition and return on capital programming costs, we just can't get our heads around it. So as we've said before we're quite comfortable with what's happening in the marketplace and we're going to compete on a differentiated internet product

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [30]

Right. And just to follow up similarly for the satellite side of the business, certainly an improvement sequentially from the last quarter in terms of subscriber front. I know there's some seasonality to it as well, but I was wondering if you could give us an update on what you're seeing in the competitive environment so far?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP &amp; COO   [31]

We think the improvement on both sides of the business, cable and satellite, is sustainable, we believe they're sustainable. As you mentioned there is an offset in seasonality on both sides of the business. On the cable side we do very well with university students on internet. We have a tough period here for the end of April

And on satellite, Q2 is -- Q3 is usually a slightly tougher quarter than Q2, but Q4 is a lot better. So the seasonality point of view is there, but I think as you look at Q2 it's a (technical difficulties) you're trending on

In terms of the turnaround on satellite, we're proud of the work that the team has done. It's a reflection of focus, and it's also clearly a reflection of segmentation, both from a pricing and marketing point of view. And so we haven't seen material shifts in some of the intensely competitive areas, but we've been able to focus very deeply on those areas that aren't as competitive in order to shift some of the gain

So we're proud of what the team has done. And we're equally proud of what they've done on success base to turn the subscriber story around while also being more focused on success (technical difficulties)

Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [32]

Great. Great, that's very helpful. And then the final one for me, just given the growing trend toward video consumption through streaming, I was wondering if you could give us an update on your thoughts behind how Shaw will capitalize on this trend. I know you've recently launched three additional Shaw Go apps, I think to show kids programming on mobile devices, but could we see the launch of a more integrated over-the-top service to better address the segment in the future, soon?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [33]

Phillip, it's Brad here. I think you continue to look, and we realize TV Everywhere is part of our strategy, part of being able to serve customers. I think you're looking at different things that are going on in different markets, not only our own but down in the US, and other things, and just looking at what other options are there, what other guys are doing. So you're having somewhat of those things, having those conversations, and unfortunately a lot of people have different views and different strategies and different plans. So I think you're dealing with that somewhat, too

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [34]

That's very helpful. Thanks very much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [35]

Our next question comes from Tim Casey from BMO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [36]

Thanks. I was wondering if we could talk a little bit about pricing beyond just the short-term promotional aspect of it. How are you approaching pricing power across video, data, and voice, and what are you hearing back from customers in terms of your ability to put through price increases? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP &amp; COO   [37]

We are on sort of a annual, not sort of, we're on an annual rate adjustment period that happened in September. And I think it would be reasonable to assume, given the amount of growth in data usage in the network, that there would be another rate adjustment this coming September. Certainly the focus is on data from a pricing perspective because that's where there's a major shift in usage. Don't see a lot of focus on pricing on the video and voice side

Certainly in terms of the marketplace, the internet product and how its being consumed today, find with Wi-Fi has given room for pricing to move. And if you look at some of the moves that have been made and the fact that internet churn has dropped dramatically even post those moves, I think it's a story of us continuing major, major investments in internet capacity and some pricing adjustments that go (technical difficulties)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [38]

Are you benefiting from a move among your customers to higher bucket plans, be they capacity or speed as well?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP &amp; COO   [39]

Yes, for sure

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [40]

Can you quantify the two in terms of upgrading customers versus raw price increases? Is there any way you can give us some color on that?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP &amp; COO   [41]

I don't think I can do it in a way that would be helpful for you without revealing stuff that hasn't been previously disclosed

Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg MacDonald from Macquarie Capital

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [44]

Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Wanted to ask a question on the media side. And I'm curious about some comments that Rogers made recently to regulators about what they call dramatic changes in the broadcast revenue model. And I think they were specifically referring to sort of the technology changes, move toward over-the-top viewership and what that might do to the broadcast model

Now I'll admit they were supporting their sports and spectrum strategies when talking about this, but could you guys just talk generally about what you're seeing as the impact of these structural changes on the broadcast model? And what do you see as the future over next, let's call it two to three years for the broadcast model as a result?

Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP &amp; Presdient Shaw Media   [45]

Sure. It's Paul here. There's no question we're seeing a shift across the various platforms in terms of where the audiences are trending, and consequently where the advertising is showing up, and conventional television being under the greatest pressure. So, I mean, conventional television is under pressure because of shifts in the way in people consume news, for one reason

Where they're getting news more on a 24/7 basis through the internet, and that's causing a reduction of audiences on the major broadcasts. So, and then there's no question that as we see new competition coming in that's unregulated over the top that we have longer-term concerns as it relates to pressure that that puts on our business

The strength of Google and making deals on a worldwide basis with some of our customers. So these are some of the competitive impacts that we're dealing with. Now like all businesses that face these various challenges, we develop new strategies to address them

So one of them is to be able to monetize our digital-based web offerings more effectively. Another is to make sure we're as efficient as possible through automation on the conventional television side

So we're not out of tricks to balance the challenges that we're seeing on the revenue side with cost reductions as well. So that's maybe a bit of flavor that would jive with what you're hearing from Rogers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [46]

Paul, just as a quick follow on, I want to draw attention to Rogers' comment that since December they've seen even a change in the revenue model that they have. Are you seeing anything like that? Are things changing that dramatically and that quickly?

Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP &amp; Presdient Shaw Media   [47]

No, I don't -- I couldn't relate to a change that dynamic. I'm sure they felt it in one way or another, but I wouldn't build that into our business, no

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [48]

Right, so this goes back to --

Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP &amp; Presdient Shaw Media   [49]

More gradual

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [50]

This goes back to your comment on the temporariness of the impact on the Olympics. Do you expect a full bounce back to what we saw in sort of the Q4 growth rates, or have things dampened down a bit since then?

Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP &amp; Presdient Shaw Media   [51]

Well we started off the year with a tough first quarter. So it was kind of a mucky year for advertising in total. But as we know, the advertising can bounce around year over year depending on the client spending and that kind of thing. It's just typical that you get some movement there

So no, we don't -- we did feel that the reaction at the Olympics was a short-term reaction and that we would see it return to more normal patterns in the future, and that's kind of a moderate rate of growth on the advertising side, but we're certainly not seeing the sky falling in any way. We're seeing -- we're quite optimistic, particularly among our specialty business which continues to grow with confidence, and as I say, there's lots of opportunities to balance the cost side as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP Corporate Development &amp; CFO   [52]

And Greg, to put that in perspective as well, I'll just say that on a year-to-date basis the conventional network for us is still positive in terms of EBITDA

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [53]

Okay, that's helpful. Thanks, Steve

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [54]

Thank you. Our next question comes from Maher Yaghi from Desjardins

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [55]

Thank you for taking my question. Guys, I wanted to ask you a question about, when you look forward as you're transitioning, and you mentioned IPTV in your discussion, MD&amp;A. Can you guide us about when you are going to launch that service?
 And when you look at experiences with, let's say HBO Go crashing in the US on the premiers for Game of Thrones, when you look at your IPTV programming expansion conversion, how much can you be in terms of safety, in terms of broadband experience to the consumer? Do you fear that there could be some lapses from time to time as you transition to that programming?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP &amp; COO   [56]

Great. It's Jay. I'm not sure I'm going to be all that helpful for you today. In terms of differentiating between an over-the-top service and carrier-grade technology that we both have in our network today and are deployed, I think that they are different experiences and I don't have any insight to the specific example that you cited

In terms of our IPTV strategy, as we've said in the past, like all of the cable companies are doing we've made some foundational investments in the move to IP. We're not in a position where we're prepared to sort of fully announce our road map or give specific details of what's going to happen over the next coming years. The investments that we've made so far are foundational

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [57]

Okay, okay. And then just one question about your Wi-Fi deployment. Can you share with us some maybe quantitative or aspects of how that has improved your customer retention or lowered your churn for your customer base versus not having it maybe in some other regions? Maybe like if you compare different regions where you have the Wi-Fi versus where you don't have Wi-Fi? Maybe you can share with us the churn rates?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [58]

I think when you look at it, it's Brad here, it certainly is, we certainly see the benefit and the churn reduction in that. I don't think we're prepared to give you what we're seeing, because you do have a little bit of a moving target there, but there's no doubt the benefit, and it continues to show that trend. So we're very pleased and happy with the churn results

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [59]

Okay, thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [60]

Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Goff from Euro Pac

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Euro Pac - Analyst   [61]

Thank you very much for taking my question. I have two questions, if I could. The first would be on the internet. Could you talk to the drivers behind the gains in the standalone internet subscribers? And then as a second question, could you talk about the headwinds you're facing from wireless local loop on your telephony?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP &amp; COO   [62]

Yes, Rob. It's Jay again. So in terms of internet standalone, I think we've seen a fundamental shift in philosophy on our part here. We are a network and content company, and it's our intention to embrace that in all of its form

So while we previously would lead with video, and all of our pricing was video-based and you added internet and voice and other services to it. Fully structured our organization now to be the place to go for people who love internet, and if they want to add video and voice to that, then that's fantastic as well. And I think you've seen that in the growth of our internet standalone, and I think you're going to continue to see our internet standalone grow. And I think we think it's a good thing

In terms of wireless local loop, we certainly had a little blip around launch that was enough to be noticeable, but we haven't seen any sort of growth trend from that blip

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Euro Pac - Analyst   [63]

Okay, thank you. And if I may, could I ask in terms of the progress you're experiencing on the [SMB] side of things?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [64]

Yes, we've had another good quarter at Shaw Business. We actually are seeing momentum in the medium space at this particular point in time, lots of competition in the small space based on price, and I think that's probably driven by just where both of those spaces are in the market share cycle. So we're going to continue to drive in both those spaces, and we're very pleased with where we are so far

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [65]

And in terms of our guidance, we're in line with our 20% projected growth increase in the business segment, and we can also add, as we've said before that the Envision acquisition, which gave us access to 560 buildings locally here for connectivity, has certainly helped to be able to spur along additional business. We've got 46 of the top 100 customers in Calgary, and that's been a very big positive for us in moving the needle forward here in business in the city

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Euro Pac - Analyst   [66]

That's great. Thank you very much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Questions and Answers

 Jeff Fan, Scotiabank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [2]

A couple of questions. First is on the broadband subscriber base. What we're noticing in the last couple of quarters is the standalone broadband subscriber base is growing pretty quickly. And it looks like it's really the main source of your broadband subscriber growth. Wondering if you can give us some color on what's driving this, whether there's any ties to the push on the WiFi service, and whether these customers are coming on because of that? And maybe just a bit on the profile and what kind of customers these are

And then the second question is just on the media side. We saw some impact during the Olympics quarter on some advertising dollar being shifted. Wondering if you can help us quantify what the impact might be during the last quarter from what's going on with the World Cup, whether you're seeing some revenue shift there for the current fiscal quarter. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - EVP, COO   [3]

Great. Jeff, it's Jay. I'll take the first part of the question. I think it's fair to say that we're pleased overall with the continuation of the shift in the marketplace that's happening here in Western Canada. And for sure our Internet gain of over 12,000 is a terrific proof point of our differentiated Internet strategy

Remember that this was Q3, and we do very well with university students. Q3's normally a tough quarter for us on the Internet side, so this is our best Q3 results since 2010. I think for sure, it's driven by a number of market segments, including business as a significant part of the standalone Internet add

I think as you've seen through our strategy shift, we have for sure disaggregated the bundle to deliver a customer experience that customers can enjoy. And if a customer wants to buy an Internet product and only an Internet product without video or voice, we're excited to deliver that experience to them. I think you've seen that

I think it's important to remember that our Internet penetration of past households is only 47%. So, as Brad talks of us as a network and content experience company, this base is an important part of growth for us

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - EVP, President Shaw Media   [4]

It's Paul here. No, we're not seeing any shifts in advertising due to the World Cup soccer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [5]

Okay. Just a quick follow-up --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [6]

Sorry, Jeff. I'll just add one thing to that. I think people have forgotten that we had Historia and Series+ in the results last year. And so there was CAD8 million in the quarter last year related to Historia and Series+, and CAD5 million of EBITDA. So, when you take that into context, we've actually grown our EBITDA in media quarter over quarter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [7]

Okay. Just a quick follow-up on the standalone Internet, just to clarify, is this driven by mostly business, or is it more of the consumer group or millennial customer consumer base?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - EVP, COO   [8]

I would say it's about an equal split, Jeff. For sure, we have gains in Internet. Internet's a core product for us in business. We haven't really seen directional shift in the business Internet space. We've seen pretty consistent gains. I think that the shift in direction has come mostly on the consumer side on Internet

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [9]

Okay. Great. Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [10]

Vince Valentini, TD Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [11]

If I can follow-up on that one, this improved traction with the broadband business in the consumer space, do you have a sense of whether it's being driven more by your WiFi or more by the improvements in speed that you've made with network investments?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - EVP, COO   [12]

Vince, it's Jay again. I think there's a number of things that are really helping our differentiated Internet experience. And we look at things like the Netflix surveys and the leadership position in terms of the mainstream providers in speed, as another great proof point that our accelerated capital fund has worked, and that the investments we've made in our network are really driving the customer experience

We've seen very positive uptake in our likelihood to recommend, both in the Internet space and on WiFi, which we're just delighted about. And we also know that our customers are valuing and using WiFi. Brad shared with you some of the churn benefits that we're seeing there. So, I think all of that is combining to help start a shift in the marketplace here

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [13]

Okay. And if I can segue that question into ARPU and pricing, are you also seeing an accelerated shift or a continued positive shift in subscribers to higher speed tiers where they pay more?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - EVP, COO   [14]

Yes, we are

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [15]

Can you give us any data points on that? Your EBITDA growth seems still pretty attractive but revenue growth wasn't overwhelming this quarter in the cable segment. Is there any more color you can give us on that -- what kind of uptick you're seeing in ARPU from up-tiering?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - EVP, COO   [16]

I don't know that we'll -- because of the way our bundles work, it's difficult to give too precise numbers. Clearly we've got some movement upward on our Internet ARPU. Clearly we have some movement downward on our video ARPU. And, so, I think you see an offset there

On one level I hear the concern about 3% revenue growth and 6% EBITDA growth. We've talked before, I think if you look at our business, we're thinking about a 2% to 4% revenue growth business. And if we want to get EBITDA growth of more than 2% to 4%, then we need to do things like we did in this quarter. So, I wouldn't be alarmed with 3% revenue growth

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [17]

Okay. And, lastly, rate increases, given consumers seem to like what you're selling, have you given any thought to normal rate increases in September, especially on the broadband side?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - EVP, COO   [18]

To refresh everybody, in FY14 we had a rate adjustment in cable in September. We'll play out the model forward as we roll out FY15 guidance. I would say we're not necessarily planning right on September 1, but I would anticipate that you'd see some changes to broadband pricing in the first half of next year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [19]

Okay. Thanks

Glen Campbell, Bank of America

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [21]

Switching back to WiFi, a lot of cable companies have taken this move toward home spot modems where all their customers can access service from any of their customers. I know you've taken a look at that. Can you talk about how you see the pros and cons of that move from a Shaw perspective?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [22]

Glen, it's Brad. I think our focus has been, for Wi-Fi, to continue to build the network and have customers enjoying sign up. I think as we look at it and we see what Comcast has been able to do and some of the other guys down in the US, and we're in close contact with them, see the benefits in how it's working. I think we're in a certain advantage because we're a little bit more ahead on public WiFi, or municipal WiFi they call it, than the others

But for us, it's part of the network. So, it's something I think you'll look at down the road and say, it's all about expanding the network, it's trying to create value for all our customers. And I think it would be just a matter of when, not if

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [23]

Okay, that's great. A couple follow-ups, if I might. First, on cost inflation on the content side, it helps you on media revenues. And obviously there's some cost there with what you're buying in Hollywood, and then there's the offset on the cable side. Could you give us a sense directionally as to what you're thinking will happen over the next year on those parameters? Will cost inflation be a little more rapid in the year ahead than it was in the year just that you're in? With your buying in Hollywood, is this likely to increase the rate of content costs in place or do you think it will moderate a little bit on that side? Can you give us just a rough sense?

Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - EVP, President Shaw Media   [24]

Sure. It's Paul here. We found it to be a pretty moderate market from that standpoint. And we went down and bought less shows this year than we did a year ago at this time. And it always helps to be in the market for less programming. It makes us less desperate to pick up the shows at a high rate. So, we were very pleased with the way the market responded to our offers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [25]

Okay, great. Then on the cable and satellite side -- similar? Or maybe easier this year?

Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - EVP, President Shaw Media   [26]

You mean in terms of the increases we might enjoy?

Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [27]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - EVP, President Shaw Media   [28]

It's not buoyant from that standpoint. I'd say that it's a fairly flat to low growth market

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [29]

Okay. Good. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [30]

We're still in contract on many things but we will see some network increases in certain areas. And we'll also have to see what comes out of the regulatory hearing, as well. But nothing, Glen, that I can say that's unusual or out of scope with what we've normally seen in the past

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [31]

Okay, great. Thanks. One quick last one, do your subscriber numbers include unbundled loops that you're providing third parties? And can give us a sense of how much of that there is in your base? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - EVP, COO   [32]

I don't know that we can. I don't have the number right in front of us. We're happy to follow-up

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [33]

Okay, great. Thanks very much

Phillip Huang, Barclays Capital

 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [35]

A question on the enterprise opportunity. I think you guys have mentioned in the past that you see solid opportunity in the enterprise market. Was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that and whether it might involve increased collaboration with partners in going after those opportunities?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - EVP, COO   [36]

Yes, for sure. We see a tremendous opportunity in the business market. We think part of our reorganization has been to enable us to get the right level of focus and the right level of resources behind those opportunities. We've had success so far with really small businesses. And we think we're going to continue to have success with really small businesses. It's absolutely a big part of our future

We are having great runs in some of our newer spaces, including wholesale and partnership agreements with other providers. We're having some great success on the medium side. About half of our growth is coming from medium, which is a space that is really almost completely new to us. We see the transition to the IP cloud-based technologies as a great opportunity for our business to enter that space. So, I think those are some of the key opportunities we see in the short term

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [37]

And when you talk about potential increased collaboration, do you think of it more as sharing of infrastructure, or what type of partnership or collaboration would seem most logical as you go after these opportunities?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [38]

Phillip, it's Brad here. I would think we would be -- we're always open to having discussions to see what moves the move the business forward and what makes sense from a timing point of view and a market point of view. As I look at it and as Jay said, we have a real nice opportunity here. We've done some restructuring here to really allow us to focus more on the divisions. And we need to let that flow through a little bit and get that tee'd up and running

But we're continuing to look at how we address the market, how you grow the market. Short term, mid term looks well but how do you continue that? So, we're going to be open to seeing how best to move forward as we look longer term

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [39]

Got it. And second question, on Spectrum sale, I believe the five-year moratorium is up in September. Given you received a CAD200 million deposit from Rogers last year, does this mean that you will need to pay them back on this if the [second] sale is not approved by Industry Canada sometime in the next fiscal year?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - EVP, COO   [40]

The rules are pretty clear when we bought the Spectrum that after five years you could transfer them to incumbents. So, we still work on that premise. And we're not entertaining hypothetical ideas, but in the event -- to understand the structure of the deal -- they paid us a CAD50 million nonrefundable option premium, and the CAD200 million, were it not to be approved at some point in the future, would be refundable to them

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [41]

Got it. And then last question, is a question on your investments in Pulser and SHOP. CA, it looks like the investments, just based on your disclosure, totaled roughly around CAD46 million, maybe, in the quarter. Just wanted to better understand how these investments might fit in your future overall strategy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [42]

We have a ventures group that's looking for things which are going to provide us with diversification. Also looking at technologies that may be disruptive, and looking at things that are adjacent to our business. REO is a very good example -- a streaming music service -- of something that's adjacent to our business. It fits very well with our WiFi offering of taking your Internet with you and taking your music with you

And so we have the Canadian rights to that and we're going to be promoting that in line with our Internet and WiFi products. We think it's a superior interface, superior service. And we're very excited about that as being an added value and added service for our customers

On SHOP. CA, SHOP. CA is a tremendous e-commerce platform in Canada. 2% of Canadian retail sales are done online, 11% in the US, 25% in the U K. So, we really lag because most people haven't -- most Canadians haven't wanted to do too much cross-border with all the duty and all of the rest of it. But they've got 3 million products, 500 different merchants on there

It's a great fulfillment engine, and what's very important since we made this investment. And really working with them in our media venture group in terms of promoting the product, as well. And there's lots for opportunities here for us to work together very favorably

But they've just done a deal with EMEA, over the Aeroplan, so that every dollar that you spend on SHOP. CA will earn you an Aeroplan mile. And we know that Canadians very much like their Aeroplan miles. And that's the first step and then there's further steps coming down the line

It's a very robust marketplace of both well-established products, big brand names, big labels, and also trendy stuff that young people enjoy, as well. It's growing very rapidly, and it's a very impressive group of people

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [43]

Got it. Thank you so much

Drew McReynolds, RBC Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [45]

Just a couple follow-ups. Maybe, Steve, for you, just on free cash flow priorities. As we look into the future in the next two to three years, your free cash flow growth profile certainly looks to be improving quite substantially. So, can you remind us where you're prioritizing dividend increases versus buybacks, debt repayment and maybe some tuck-in acquisitions? And then I have a couple follow-ups after that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP and CFO   [46]

Yes. I think we're still looking for opportunities in terms of tuck-in acquisitions. There's some interesting things out there for us to be considering. Dividend increases, of course. We've been very consistent with dividend increases and we'll have to look at that again. We've said 8% last year, roughly 5% to 10% this year. And we'll examine that in light of certainly the regulatory changes that are possible here

Share buybacks -- I don't see us being a big proponent of share buybacks at this point given the nature of the valuation of our industry based on EBITDA as opposed to EPS. And certainly from a debt point of view we're at 2 times debt to EBITDA right now. And, so, we're really where we want to be. So, we won't be focusing on a lot of debt repayment at this point

So, there's lots of alternatives for us. And we've also, when we did the notes in January, we did a two-year FRN that expired in 2016. So, we have the opportunity to repay those FRNs without penalty when they come up

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [47]

Drew, just to add to that a little bit, you talked about tuck-ins. We did have discussion at the Board. We're tending to look a little bit more at the data center businesses and the opportunities in a more meaningful way. So, just from your tuck-in point of view, I just want to give you a little color on that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [48]

That's all very helpful. And maybe a couple of follow-ups here, just a little bit of a technical one. In your calculation of free cash flow, you have the CODC benefit funding flowing through. Can you just remind us when that comes to an end?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP and CFO   [49]

Actually, for this year I think it was CAD53 million. And for next year, it's going to be about half that, roughly CAD25 million, CAD26 million. And that's because the old Canwest benefits that we assumed on the takeover of Canwest are fully done at that point. And we're just carrying forward, then, with the new benefits at a rate of, I'd say, around CAD24 million, CAD25 million

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [50]

Okay. And is that CAD24 million, CAD25 million recurring after 2015?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP and CFO   [51]

Yes. That's got another probably four or five years left to go

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [52]

Okay. That's great. And my last question, just wondering if you can give us a little bit of extra granularity around the business net additions in the quarter. Is this something that is recurring? Or just some additional context would be great

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - EVP, COO   [53]

It's Jay. I'll take that one. I think if you look at our growth in our RGUs -- and some of our mid-market growth doesn't necessarily reflect in RGUs because of how we deliver, but certainly small does -- we've been relatively stable in terms of our Internet growth in RGUs, and relatively stable in terms of our phone growth in the course of this year

The video business on the business side is more vertical specific. There's only three or four verticals that really value video, although the three or four verticals that we have that value video value it a lot. And I think it's fair to say that Q3 was our strongest quarter in business video this year

That having been said, I think we're going to have a decent quarter in Q4 in business video, as well. It was certainly our best quarter we've had this year and that's why we disclosed it. And I think starting in September, you'll be able to, as we divide by business and consumer, you'll be able to see even better granularity on those trends

 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [54]

The other thing I would add is that we started the year at CAD300 million of business revenues and we expected forecasted growth of 20%. And we're going to achieve that growth

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [55]

Okay. That's great. And interesting on the TV side on the business side because I don't think we hear a lot about that. These three to four verticals, are they currently with your competitor, or is this just new potential penetration of verticals that's up for grabs?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - EVP, COO   [56]

The majority of our wins in this quarter were from a competitor

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [57]

Okay. Thanks very much for that

Maher Yaghi, Desjardins

 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [59]

I wanted to ask you about the trends you're seeing in the use of the Shaw Go apps in terms of percentage of your base who are using it also. Are you planning to have a single platform to access live TV programming on other screens? And, finally, as the use of the Go apps increases, how is that affecting your legacy broadcasting revenue model as more and more clients watch shows on demand rather than live broadcast?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - EVP, COO   [60]

Maher, I'll take the first one and then let Steve take the model question. So catching everyone up with where we are on TV Everywhere, we've actually got 12 Shaw Go apps, including Global, History, CTV, Movie Central, NFL, NBA, Treehouse, YTV, A&amp;E, Family, Disney Junior and Disney HD

So we create a very rich Everywhere experience for our customers, all authenticated back to their video subscription. I think we've shared we've had 2.4 million total downloads to date. And so far our TV Everywhere strategy has 10 million hours of cumulative video so far

When you ask about aggregation, for sure our next-generation video program contemplates many of those steps, and takes it in parallel with the moves that we're making on the rest of the next-generation video program. And I think it's fair to say that taken generally, our path, the next-generation video is step-by-step hybrid, and that we've said before our investments have been foundational. So I think the path that you'll see us take there looks very similar to the path of the majority of other North American MSOs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP and CFO   [61]

And, Maher, just in terms of the general use of TV Everywhere -- and this was something I have to give credit to Vince for reporting -- but when you look at the first quarter, calendar quarter this year compared to last year, online video viewing was up 46%. Now, online video viewing is still challenged by the fact that it's very difficult to measure what exactly you're getting as an advertiser. But TV Everywhere viewing was up 250%

It's still early days for that, but what that shows is that people are willing to pay for a cable subscription if they get the benefit of being able to watch it anywhere at any time, and that there's a lot of cross value between that. So, they may not be watching it on their TV but they're watching it where they want to watch Global Go and Bell. And, by the way, the CTV app and Global Go app are now both authenticated. So, anybody who's a CTV subscriber or a Global subscriber can watch programs or live on either. It's a positive sign to say that TV Everywhere helps to lessen disruption overall in the base business

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [62]

Right. But how about the media broadcast revenue model? Because I understand it's actually good to keep the customers paying for the cable side of the business, the BDU side. But how about the broadcasting side of the revenue model there? How's that getting affected by people seeing less advertising?

Paul Robertson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - EVP, President Shaw Media   [63]

It's Paul here. Currently we are not seeing any material impact. I think as time goes forward, we're going to have to get more effective at developing the advertising model. And that's all part of our plan just to make sure that we're as effective as possible at gleaning the advertising from the Go apps

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [64]

So, up to now you're not seeing pressure on margins because of this move to online viewing?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP and CFO   [65]

No. We're seeing, and we expect to see increased online advertising next year. But I think it is important not to understate the fact that people are watching all of this content with ads in it behind an authenticated window. Remember that TV Everywhere, when I talk about it, is a product that you have to have an authenticated cable subscription to get. So, you're not losing eyeballs necessarily, or revenue, as a result of that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [66]

Okay. Thank you

Greg MacDonald, Macquarie

 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [68]

This is a company that's probably done the most in the last few years to prepare, at least from a network perspective, for future competition. It's been a pretty comprehensive investment. It's not just bandwidth upgrades and digitization, IPTV or IP video, the WiFi network. So, what I'm going to try and ask is to get a sense of future CapEx trends. I'll direct it to Steve. Steve, can you tell us, in your view, what a range of normalized capital intensity is for the modern day now? Is this still an 18%, 19% capital intensity business? I'm speaking on the cable side

And then, secondly, you spent well north of 20% for a number of years. And I make reference to this very comprehensive spend that you've had. This scenario, am I being too optimistic to think that you could end up going through the downward cycle of a CapEx cycle in the 2016-2017 timeframe where you might actually be able to under-spend relative to normalized capital intensity?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP and CFO   [69]

I think there's a few things there. One is we have invested, as you said, a significant amount of money to digitizing our network, and that has great advantages for us. There's the opportunity to digitize further and release a lot more analog capacity back into the network. And that's something that we're looking to do

I would say that there's a price to pay for being able to maintain the quality of service for customers on the broadband side. We're seeing peak capacity increases of 60% year over year

You may have seen recently the Netflix study that came out that said that, outside of Bell fiber and Bell line fiber, we were the number one leading service provider of Netflix to our customers over the Internet. And that speaks to the amount of money that we've invested in the network in providing our customers with that experience. We were equal to the best in the US. And out east there were some people who didn't fare as well in that survey

It's important for us because you're paying a fee for Internet and you should be able to watch what you want, you should be able to have good service. And when people don't have that they blame it on us, they don't blame it on Netflix. So we're keeping up there

So I would say a few things. One is just the rate of growth of broadband traffic and data growth. And also, the second thing would be the speed at which we move on IPTV. And, so, how we scale that and how we move that forward, will be a gating factor in how CapEx looks going forward

But certainly you make a good point. There's a lot of things that we've done already that have provided us with a superior network and a superior compelling customer proposition, not to mention even WiFi. And WiFi's only been CAD100 million at this point and look at the benefits that we've gotten out of that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [70]

Great, okay. And so, Steve, not to put you into too much of a spot here, but is capital intensity sub 20 where we're going in 2016 and beyond because of the spend that you have, that you've had in, let's say, the last two or three years?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP and CFO   [71]

I would say subject to those factors, that's possible

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [72]

I can appreciate you not wanting me to get too optimistic. But as you point out, you've spent a lot of money on a lot of different things. I would suggest you're ahead of the curve now when it comes to --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - SVP and CFO   [73]

We are. And certainly the accelerated capital fund and the money that we've been able to spend on that on broadband management capacity, those kinds of things have been -- our data center which will come online next September -- all of those things put us ahead of the curve. And so, yes, you should see a reduction overall in CapEx intensity. I just can't be specific. I think to be direct, IPTV's the one that will decide where we are in terms of that band, plus or minus 3%

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [74]

Okay. That's helpful. Thanks a lot

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

Thank you

(Operator Instructions)

The first question is from Jeff Fan of Scotiabank. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [2]

Hello. Thanks very much, and good afternoon, everyone. My first question is just a clarification on the WiFi. Brad, you talked about, I think 1.25 million registered devices. Wondering how many households that roughly represents? So I guess, looking at a penetration number in terms of the number of households that are actually using the WiFi?
 And then, the second question is really on internet. I guess, with all the over-the-top news that we have been hearing in the last couple of weeks, one of the things that I'm thinking about is, what is the importance of the internet-only subscribers that is in your base? We are seeing some pretty good growth in your disclosure. I think roughly 20% of your base is now internet-only

Can you talk a little bit about that -- the profile of these customers? Just give us a sense as what the ARPU and churn and usage may be? Because I guess, as OTT becomes bigger, this base could become a lot bigger, and just wondering how that would impact financially going forward? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [3]

Sure. Thanks, Jeff. I will start, and I think Jay will add something, and I might go a little further than you want on WiFi. From a penetration point of view, on the homes passed is 28% of actual customers, Shaw customers, home penetration. Not homes passed, sorry

It's interesting as we look at the WiFi development worldwide and what's going on, the new technologies, this Hotspot 2.0, the roaming relationships happening around the world, the new business models being creating, the opportunity when you look at it, just from a point of view of our extension of broadband, and how that's resonating with customers, the likelihood to recommend as I mentioned in my speech, all very important for us. And all I think tremendous signs that WiFi has a role in mobility and the wireless world. We certainly think, there is many opportunities

We are working closely with Industry Canada, and making sure there is more WiFi spectrum coming along the way. And as we look forward, we believe that the WiFi for us will be a fundamental piece in the broadband story. And we couldn't -- when you look at home spots, you look at trying to densify your network. You are looking where the people are. You are looking at the heat maps. You are building things to where your customers will get the most benefit. When I look at just the users, and the people using it. When you look at video and video streaming, is it portable? Is it mobile? We really think we have an answer for customers, and there is a tremendous value proposition

And as you can see from a device growth, account growth, we are very excited. We are very focused on continuing to add value right across our markets, and we are continuing to look at what types of roaming things. And I think one thing I would be able to say is, as we look out over the next few quarters, and you might have to give us a couple, but we will be able to I think get a little more sense of the WiFi road roadmap, and you can get a little more understanding of what some of the things we are looking at and timing. And we can -- we will be able to fill you in a little bit better there. Jay?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP, COO   [4]

Yes, and picking up on your internet-only question. So as you have seen, we now have 400,000 or so internet customers without video. And to be clear, we love those customers. They are very profitable, and they are a big part of the future of our Company, and we are making investments in things like shomi, and to a lesser extent, [Ardio] and to provide experiences for the segment. And we think of our business as a network and content experience company, and we are going to work hard to deepen our relationship with those customers

And when we talk about deepening that relationship, we are talking about deepening it in a way that provides services that customers that -- that customer segment values, not trying to take them back to some services that they left behind. So we are doing lots of things with shomi. I think, as we get to the other side of [talk] TV, [serve ND], we are going to continue to try to build the best-in-class video experience that absolutely is going to bring this customer segment back into experiencing Shaw video

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [5]

Okay. Thanks, guys. Just one clarification, the 28% number, is that a percentage of your internet subs?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [6]

Yes, that's correct. Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [7]

Okay. Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [8]

The next question is from Vince Valentini of TD Securities. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [9]

Yes, thanks. A couple of free cash flow questions to start. You mentioned that the core CapEx, beyond the accelerated CapEx fund is still CAD750 million. Correct me if I'm wrong, that was the figure prior to acquiring ViaWest. Now you seem to be including ViaWest CapEx, and it is still CAD750 million. So does the number not go up, when you add in ViaWest spending?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP, COO   [10]

That's correct. The core cable CapEx is more on the residential end Shaw business CapEx figure. So you would have a higher CapEx when you include the ViaWest

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [11]

Okay. So when you say it includes consumer and business, that doesn't include ViaWest in the CAD750 million then?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP, COO   [12]

It doesn't include ViaWest, doesn't include the current satellite group. It doesn't include the current media group. And we will clean up, as we report in the new segments for the first time in Q1, so you can get flexibility. I think we are just simply reinforcing, that our path hasn't changed from what we talked to you about before

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [13]

And similar to what we said on July 31, I mean, we are forecasting ViaWest CapEx to approximate the EBITDA figure that we gave this morning as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [14]

Right. And in another, free cash, the driver is cash taxes. You said those would be higher. Can you remind us where we are? I think it was a five-year period of accelerated or inflated cash taxes after the deferred or limited partnerships got shut down. Is this -- can you remind us where we are on that, how much of that is still left to spend in 2015?

Rhonda Bashnick,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, Finance   [15]

Hi, Vince. It's Rhonda. We are in year four of that, so it will be coming off next year. Next year, we will have another year of taxes, and then it will roll off. And we are estimating the cash tax number to be approximately CAD375 million this year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [16]

When you say next year, Rhonda, you mean it rolls off in 2016?

Rhonda Bashnick,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, Finance   [17]

2016 will be another year of pickup for cash taxes on the partnership. That will be the last year, 2017, rolls off

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [18]

2017 rolls off. Okay, yes. And one last one, if I could switch gears, maybe for Barb. In the media sort of environment, you guys seem to have posted reasonable organic growth numbers, because you had a couple assets that were divested, and you still had flat revenue. Can you give us a bit of commentary on what you are seeing, in terms of the ad market environment out there, despite things like digital media taking share, or the Canadian dollar being weak? I mean, how much pressure are you seeing on traditional advertising spending?

Barb  Williams,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP, President, Shaw Media   [19]

Yes, thanks. There is some pressure. We're seeing a little bit of softness this quarter, pacing a little bit behind, but we are seeing some catch-up in that. The advertiser is making decisions later and later, but the demand does seem to come. It certainly does put an emphasis for us though, on containing costs carefully as we go forward, and being sure that we manage our way through whatever softness might be there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [20]

Okay. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [21]

The next question is from Glenn Campbell of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [22]

Yes, thanks very much. So another question for Barb on media. Could you talk a little bit about shomi from a Shaw perspective? I guess, I understand that this is your project. We have seen the press release that Shaw has committed CAD67 million. How is -- how do you expect the numbers to kind of flow through the financial statements? And how does the partnership between Rogers and Shaw work, in terms of say, the platform as well as the content?

Barb  Williams,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP, President, Shaw Media   [23]

Well, I will let Rhonda speak to the financials. It is about 50/50 between Shaw and Rogers and the JV of shomi. From a content perspective, we are leveraging the opportunities that both Shaw and Rogers can bring to the table, in terms of deal-making for the content of the service. But as far as the financials, Rhonda, maybe you want to speak to that?

Rhonda Bashnick,  Shaw Communications Inc - SVP, Finance   [24]

Sure. So it is a 50/50 joint venture, and we are -- so it won't be proportionately consolidated in our results. It will be equity accounted for

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [25]

Okay. Great. And just to follow up, there's also the platform development aspect of shomi with authentication, and the menu, the interface, and so on. Who is taking responsibility for that?

Barb  Williams,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP, President, Shaw Media   [26]

That process was started by the Rogers team, back before we became partners with them. So the outstanding, their interface actually, the Rogers team deserves credit for getting that underway. But there is a shomi team, an independent shomi team that has its own technical group, has its own content group. And on a go-forward basis, they will be managing both the upgrades and changes, improvements to the user interface over time, as well as responsible for the ongoing relationship with our customers, and with our content suppliers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [27]

Okay. Great. We will look forward to that. And then one last one, again on the CapEx. So the CAD750 million has been identified, I guess, as the core cable CapEx for FY15. How should we think about the medium term? Is that a maintenance number, and the actual spend is likely to be kind of a little above that? Or should we think of that as being a good run rate for 2016 and beyond?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP, COO   [28]

Glen, it's Jay. You should think of that as being a good run rate for 2016 and beyond, and providing us with enough flexibility to make decisions as we go along, and make investments as we go along

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [29]

Okay. Great. Thanks very much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [30]

The next question is from Phillip Huang of Barclays. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Philip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [31]

Hello. Yes. Good afternoon. A question on ViaWest. I understand it has provided a platform for future growth in the less competitive Tier 2 US market, and you guys currently have a pretty strong presence in the Western US markets. And I think you guys have talked a little bit about looking at potential opportunities in the East Coast over the next 18 months due to demand from customers. Was wondering if you might be able to give us an update on your thinking on this front, and whether you see any attractive expansion opportunities in the near-term?

Nancy Phillips,  Shaw Communications Inc - ViaWest, Co-founder, President and CEO   [32]

Yes, thanks, Phillip. Yes, I think we have seen some very good customer demand. We have long-tenured customers who, in many cases like to be in multiple data centers with us, and the East Coast has obviously been a part of that early demand. So as you know historically, we've grown in two ways, either through greenfield builds much like our Minneapolis center that we opened this year, and/or through acquisition

And I think the key here is, that we want to pick the right way to go-to-market in the East. We have been a very patient expansion company. And I think we are obviously participating in conversations, as we see opportunities potentially come to the market. But I think the key is, that we really are looking for the enterprise grade capabilities that our customers have become accustomed to, especially in the mid-sized market

And so, I think we are looking at it, in sort of through that lens of both, not only greenfield, but potential opportunistic acquisition. And so, that's kind of where we are at today, continuing to take a look at what is going to make sense

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Philip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [33]

Right. No, that's helpful. And in terms of more for modeling for us on, you mentioned that it's going to be largely net -- free cash flow neutral over the next couple of years. Beyond that, like how should we think about the cash flow contribution for ViaWest?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [34]

Sorry, Phillip, it's Brad. I think we, when we came into the business and the diversification is, we wanted the growth. We certainly see a lot of opportunity going forward over the next 18 months and beyond, and we want to continue to maintain that growth focus, and that commitment around that. So you are going continue to see us support that model

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP, COO   [35]

And Phil, just to add, of the CAD85 million roughly of CapEx guidance we are giving for this year for ViaWest, I mean, the lion's share of that is growth capital. The maintenance capital within the business is around --

Nancy Phillips,  Shaw Communications Inc - ViaWest, Co-founder, President and CEO   [36]

2% to 3%

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP, COO   [37]

2% to 3%

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nancy Phillips,  Shaw Communications Inc - ViaWest, Co-founder, President and CEO   [38]

I mean, we have been very much online. So it's -- the lion's share is definitely about success-based capital, in terms of our organic growth strategy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Philip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [39]

Got it. Okay. And then perhaps one final question for you guys. Maybe give us an update on the AWS spectrum transfer to Rogers. I believe September was the last month of the five-year moratorium. So was just wondering what, whether you have started the process of applying to Industry Canada for the spectrum transfer? And should that transfer not be approved, was wondering if you have some idea of through the timeline as to when you expect to return the CAD200 million deposit to Rogers?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [40]

A couple things on that, I think, we have talked to the appropriate parties, and they are waiting feedback as we go through the fall here. It's something, as you look at -- we really love where we are in WiFi, and our focus and attention there. We're committed to following through on the deal with Rogers on the AWS spectrum. And even in that deal, there is options for them beyond that to allocate the spectrum

And so for us -- and subject to all those things happening, and all that coming into place and not happening, you have to consider just where things are at, from our point of view. And if you do get the spectrum back, what does that actually mean? And so, it's prudent on our part to be -- having some thoughts around that, and going from there. But we still believe the spectrum will get approved

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Philip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [41]

Right. Is any part of your consideration linked to the upcoming sort of wholesale ruling from the CRTC, or is that completely sort of irrelevant to the way you guys think about the spectrum, more how it relates to your strategy overall?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [42]

Oh, yes, it's all relevant. I think for sure, it's -- as you look at it, and you go, okay, what are the things that are going to change, and what's happening, and what's different than five years ago? And what's happening around, both in North America and globally, I think it's prudent on our part to look at all those things. And as you look at it, but we're -- we love our play in WiFi. We think there are so many opportunities there

We are just starting to crack the egg, and you are going to see us continue to make sure we develop our WiFi, and want to extend WiFi wherever possible. Now how we want to extend it, we are going to continue to build, and continue to make sure we create value through partnerships and other ways. And from that -- but I would say from a point of view of -- in case, you look at all scenarios. So I can leave it at that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Philip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [43]

Great. Thanks very much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [44]

The next question is from Drew McReynolds of RBC. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [45]

Yes. Thanks very much. Most of my questions have been answered. I might as well touch on the satellite. Just a big picture, just wondering if you could give us some granularity just on, obviously, some erosion on the subscriber front. Is that a function of the price increases you put forward?
 Is it competition? Is it cord cutting potentially in some of the more urban areas? Just wondering if you can give us some big picture context? Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP, COO   [46]

Sure, Drew. It's Jay. The, yes, I mean, clearly the satellite subscriber loss is a subscriber number that really stands out from our trajectory. Fair to say, that it's in a very competitive triple play environment, that we are struggling with our acquisition economics, for better net subscriber numbers that -- than you have seen, and getting a return on the capital invested required to get those numbers

So our approach has been clear. It's maximize free cash flow, and that approach has delivered I think this quarter, with 8% year over year EBITDA growth, and a very nice free cash flow profile on satellite. But we certainly understand the core question. Q4 is actually seasonally a good quarter for those that follow the satellite business closely, and we still had a subscriber loss of 6,600

So what does that mean in the medium and long-term profile of the business? I think we will see some more stability over time. We believe the -- we're in the competitive part of the business cycle in Eastern Canada, as the triple play battles heat up, and we believe strongly that we can maintain satellite EBITDA, including run rate EBITDA. And so, shifting dynamics, bigger focus on retention to mitigate the loss over time

To be clear, Q1 is seasonally our toughest quarter, because we have our seasonal summer business that we do with cabins, and I think you will see Q1 number that's significantly weaker than Q4. But overall, we are going to have solid EBITDA growth, both in satellite and the whole consumer division. We think it's a terrific business. We've got industry-leading customer satisfaction scores. Our core part of the base in rural has a compelling customer experience, and we are just not really chasing new customers aggressively right now, to fit in with our strategy of maximizing free cash flow and maintaining EBITDA

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [47]

Okay. Thanks. Jay, appreciate all that color. Maybe just one last one for me. Just on shomi, and perhaps for you, Barb. Interesting development, I think, for the industry, and interesting to see Shaw in there, just given kind of where your exposures lie on TV and broadcasting

Just wondering how you are positioning shomi? Do you view it as a hedge? Do you view it as complementary? Is it really thematically about just serving content up for your best internet customers, knowing that you have a very strong internet offering? Can you just help us strategically put it into context?

Barb  Williams,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP, President, Shaw Media   [48]

Sure. Thank you. I think generally we have seen statistically that the initial OTT offerings have been complementary. So we don't see this as a direct hit, as much as an opportunity to offer more choice, more plays for people to connect with our content. We are more and more able to engage in a larger basket of rights, which allows us to use this content across more platforms, including shomi. So I think this is all about respecting the customer's desire to engage with content where, when, and how they want, and being sure that we continue to offer a wide variety of options for them. And shomi is just a great opportunity for us to leverage off the tremendous content success we have had in the traditional media business, and extend it into this future platform

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [49]

And just to add to that, Barb. Drew, I think it is also, when you look at it, it's TV everywhere needs a certain part of the market, when you look at how they want to consume content and where they want. I think OTT plays also a role in there. And ultimately for us is, we are not going to sit here and say, oh, potentially we are going to sit here and guard everything, and hold and protect. You have to be able to look around, and be able to even somewhat disrupt yourself

I look way back when, yes, it is a little different scenario. But when we got into satellite, we said two out of three customers is fine with us, and we are willing to play in that game. And so, I see this very similar. I think there is also, when you look at it, I think there's always -- when you look at Netflix, and what they do in the pressure on rights, and the things that are going on, and the volatility of things, is also a driver somewhat for us in that regard

 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [50]

The next question is from Tim Casey of BMO. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [52]

Thanks. Just one clarification, and then a question. On shomi, I understand that you're equity accounting the P&amp;L of shomi itself. But will you still book content sales from your media group through Shaw consolidated P&amp;L?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [53]

Jim, I think -- let us -- could we maybe take that off line, and we will get back to you?

Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [54]

No worries. Just on WiFi, I mean, I -- certainly, obviously it's being widely accepted by your subscriber base. Are you able to provide any discrete financials on what it's contributing, or is it still really part of the package, so you are not able to draw that out? And secondly, just can you comment on what you're seeing on the voice side? As are you able -- are you offsetting what one would think would be erosion of your voice subscribers in an urban environment? Are you offsetting that with gains on the [SME] side, or what's happening on the voice part of the bucket? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [55]

Thanks, Tim. I will -- on WiFi, just from the churn benefits, I think it more than pays for the cost of rolling out WiFi. And we, as I said earlier, we continue to look at the model, continue to make sure we have a great network. We are densifying. We are planning well

And, listen, even though we have 45,000 hotspots, we are just starting in a lot of our municipal deals. We have over 60 of them that cover 4 million potential, and we continue to build off those. And we are also going to continue to make sure we build where the people are

And so, we are constantly looking at that. Not quite success base, but almost similar to that. And we continue to look at the models, and the potential for it. And but we are very focused on making sure we have a clear roadmap on what we are going to do, and how we are going to do it. And making sure we are clear on what is coming at us. Because there is a lot there, and we just want to make sure we are prudent on how we manage it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP, COO   [56]

And then picking up on the voice side. Yes, I mean, I think we are pretty comfortable with sort of maintaining overall lines, as you've seen. I think you have correctly identified that you are seeing some modest declines in the consumer voice base that are being offset by some modest increases in the very small base. The way we sell voice to medium-sized customers and other technologies doesn't really drive RGUs, and just the way we recognize things, it drives revenue. So I don't think the business growth line is as big as you might think it is. But for sure, there is some offset there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [57]

The next question is from Greg MacDonald of Macquarie Capital Markets. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [60]

Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. First, I would like to give my congratulations to Steve on his retirement. Always been professional and open with us analysts, or at least me, Steve. So I commend you on that, and wish you good luck in your retirement

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP Corporate Development, CFO   [61]

Thanks very much. (Multiple Speakers)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [62]

Yes. The question I have is on the internet pricing power. This is one company, certainly with the deployment of WiFi that you have got, that probably has a higher than average pricing power on the internet side of things. And let's face it, this is an industry that some would argue -- I certainly would -- is losing pricing power in a number of areas. But this is one that is strong for you guys. Can you comment on what pricing levers you could pull in 2015, to help hit the guidance numbers that you have? And then, I have got one definitional question after that. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP, COO   [63]

It's Jay again. Why don't I just talk about rate adjustments in general terms for us in FY15, and then we can come back to some conversations about potential future pricing power driven by WiFi. So just to level set for everybody. On the cable side of the business in FY14, we did our annual across-the-board adjustment in September. As we made plans for FY15, we modeled a number of scenarios, including doing the annual adjustment in September, as has been done in the past

And there were a number of moving pieces in the ecosystem, and we all talked it through and decided that it might be prudent this time around to give the market a little bit of time. So we are going to come with our consumer and business rate adjustments will now happen on January 1. And so, I mean, when you look at it as a number, the consumer number is a lot more material than the business numbers. So maybe focus our comments there

We have got 2.8 million consumer households, and our January rate increase is going to net about CAD9 million a month. So a little bit more than CAD3 per month per customer. I think if you model that through, I think it's fair to say the four-month delay probably takes what would have otherwise been a great FY15, when you combine the cable business with our focused lever cost cuts. Now it's just probably going to be a good FY15 with the growth in the second half

First quarter looks -- will look a little tough, just because of the combination of our annual network fee, and salary increases without the offsetting adjustment, which puts you in a slightly negative space in consumer, but the year turns around nicely, and goes to nice growth in the second half. In terms of opportunities for WiFi, I mean, we include WiFi in our Internet packaging today, that certainly we have got a likelihood to recommend on our WiFi product in the -- deep into the [80s], and it has taken likelihood to recommend our Internet product overall into the [80s], which is a dramatic increase over where it was a couple of years ago. And so, I think it's fair to say there will be other ways to monetize that over time. But for FY15 we are really looking at adoption

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [64]

Okay. So no price increases on Internet, or will there be?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP, COO   [65]

Yes. The vast majority of that price increase will be on Internet January 1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [66]

January 1. Okay. And, Jay, just to clarify, is there -- help us with the rationale on waiting. Is there a competitive aspect to that, or is that literally you've sensed that there is a little higher churn than you want, so you are delaying for that reason?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP, COO   [67]

Yes it wasn't --

Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [68]

Is it the reaction to tell us or is it sort of internal?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP, COO   [69]

It wasn't -- it certainly wasn't churn related. We had some momentum in the marketplace, and we wanted the opportunity to bring some additional value to our consumers. Certainly, there was lots of noise around pricing and packaging over that period of time, and we didn't necessarily want to step right into the middle of that. And we weren't sure about signals in the marketplace in terms of what was there. And in the gap, our primary competitor stepped in end of October, and did a significant second in the year internet rate increase. And so, that has also provided an umbrella to walk into a little bit

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [70]

Okay. That makes sense. And the definitional question, you could probably help me with this also is, in the guidance you talk about proposed including stable customer base in the assumptions. How does that relate to the PSU assumption? Most of us are probably still modeling a negative PSU overall. Does that mean you are assuming a stable PSU number when you say stable customer base?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP, COO   [71]

I think our focus in the business, and certainly on the cable side of the consumer business, we have already talked in detail about the -- about the satellite business. Our focus in the cable business is absolutely to maintain our number of customers. And when I say customers, I mean unique billing relationships, and we are certainly driving -- our message, as you heard us say, we are happy for a customer to take whatever product from us they see value on. So it's really not about chasing a customer who no longer wants to subscribe to home phone, or really not about changing a customer who doesn't want to subscribe to a premium video customer, but to maintain that relationship with the customer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [72]

Right. So we should think of it in terms of not necessarily users, which is kind of the PSU definition, but more in terms of accounts? Is that what you are suggesting?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP, COO   [73]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [74]

The customer relation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP, COO   [75]

Yes, I think that is helpful. And if you think about it in terms of number of accounts using your phrase, the X and the Y being not in our group, we have got a nice package (inaudible) as well as

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [76]

I see. Okay. Thanks a lot

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [77]

Next question is from Maher Yaghi of Desjardins. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [79]

Yes, thank you for taking my question. Brad, I want to go back to a question that was asked on wireless, and you mentioned you are reviewing what is going on worldwide, in terms of wireless to guide you into what your next move will be. Can you maybe be more specific on what you referred, or you meant by looking at what's going on in the world?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [80]

I think you ultimately start with WiFi. And certainly everything going on there, and the success of it, and the development, and the R&amp;D, and the coordination and the first WiFi, and a variety of different things we continue to look at, and continue to have conversations in doing that. I think it's relative, when you look at WiFi, you certainly look at the whole mobile space. I think for us, it's as you see certain things happen, you want to have certain data points

You want information. You want to be able to understand what's going on, related to different markets, and knowing they are all different. But for us, it's research. It's homework. It's all the things we like to do

It is all of the patience, and the rigorous around what we're doing, and this is no different, and we'll take it as we see it. I think the more informed you are, the better you are. So it's simple as that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [81]

Do you believe -- I mean, are you referring more specifically to the use of WiFi to deploy wireless service, in addition to just the regular internet access?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [82]

Well, I think ultimately you go, where will it broaden? Where does the technology go? What opportunities are there? You have hotspot 2.0, you are thinking things

But ultimately for us, it's make insuring what technology, what roaming, whatever other things we do fits into the model, fits into the business case, gives us opportunities to grow, to increase revenue, to increase that strong link with the broadband home, and continue to do that. So that's always core for us, and in core thinking, how it translates, and how well things go beyond that, we're certainly interested to see. And we want to be on top of it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP, COO   [83]

Building on Brad's thoughts, our WiFi strategy is to be our customer's primary network. We want to have them on a great WiFi experience in the home, and we want them on Shaw Go WiFi anywhere they go and stay. And so, of course, in that world where we are trying to create that level of value, we are interested in what else is happening in the ecosystem. And so, if there were to be a fourth provider from somebody else on very competitive roaming, that would help shape how we would package our WiFi primary network strategy. And so, it's about a primary network, and we are absolutely staying on that path

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [84]

That makes sense. And just on the accelerated CapEx, you spent CAD350 million so far. You still have only CAD150 million to go. Can you talk a little bit about the achievements you have so far in spending those CAD350 million? And when you look forward, are there any particular additional investments that you feel you need to make above and beyond that CAD750 million that you have talked about as a run rate for the cable business?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP, COO   [85]

Yes. So, I mean, we're certainly pleased with the progress of our accelerated capital fund. We think it has had an impact in the marketplace. We think it has allowed us to provide a differentiated internet experience. And to recap for everybody, we are CAD350 million invested so far. The final CAD150 million invested in FY15

The investments include, just to revisit our program, completion of our data center for the digtization of our network. We have got additional bandwidth upgrades, Shaw business investments for growth, and absolutely, expansion in WiFi. And we just went through a process, Focus to Deliver, as we have talked about before has 11 work streams to it. And we just went through -- completed our capital efficiency work stream, which was a top to bottom zero-based review of 591 buckets of capital

And so, we're very close to our capital spend, and can affirm that that CAD750 million number going forward gives us lots of room to make choices in the future, and give us the opportunities to do the things we want to do. It is a little peculiar this quarter, because we're just in the process of changing segments. So I think as we get into January, it will be a cleaner story to tell, as you can see how the capital flows across the consumer business, and how it flows across the business business unit, and it might be a little easier for you to model from there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [86]

Okay. Thank you very much

Next question is from Rob Goff of Euro Pac. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Euro Pacific Capital, Inc. - Analyst   [88]

And thank you very much for taking my question. I, too, would like to extend best wishes and congratulations to Steven

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP Corporate Development, CFO   [89]

Thanks very much, Rob. I appreciate that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Euro Pacific Capital, Inc. - Analyst   [90]

Most welcome. In terms of questions, Brad, I would -- I typically ask about the growth in the SME marketplace, whether you are there between the 10% and 20% annual growth? My second area of questioning would be on the internet only with -- when you look at the addition of roughly 72,000 on the year, to what extent would they be new to Shaw? Or would they be those leaving video, and just taking it on a streaming basis?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP, COO   [91]

Yes. Okay. I'll start with SME, and see if I can help you with the Shaw business math, which, again, gets a little confusing just with a couple of our changes. So as we have talked about in the past, in FY13 and FY14 Shaw business grew at 20% per year, and that both included organic growth and some growth through acquisition. You recall we purchased Envision, and Envision happened over two years. It was an April closing. And so, it was part of that 20% number in each of the two years

So if you break that down a bit further, in FY13 Shaw business grew revenue by CAD48 million, and that was CAD37 million organic which was 15%, and CAD11 million from Envision. In FY14, it was CAD37 million organic again, and 20 -- or 12%, and CAD21 million from Envision. And so we would see a similar level of organic growth in FY15 on that part of the business, which is what has historically been called the cable Shaw business

We are very pleased with our reorg, in that we have put together every experience that a business can choose from Shaw, into a single business unit here in Canada. And so, added to that is the satellite B2B businesses, and two of those are much lower growth. So we've got our Shaw tracking business that offers tracking services to the long-haul trucking market, and we have got Shaw broadcast doing satellite video transport. And those are both very stable businesses, and have generated approximately almost right on between them, CAD80 million in revenue each of the last three years

So there is not really growth in those businesses, but they are very good free cash flow. And then just closing out the business segment, the B2B Shaw Direct business has had nice growth just like the cable B2B space, with mid teen growth over the last two years, and in FY14 contributed CAD23.5 million in revenue. So hopefully, that lets you sort of build back the equation and have a look at next year

The next question is from Vince Valentini of TD Securities. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [94]

Yes, thanks for throwing me back in. Jay, just on the factors you were going over for delaying the rate increases this year, was regulatory one of them, given that the Let's Stop TV hearing was in September, and you would have been raising rates right on top of that?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP, COO   [95]

Yes. I wouldn't overplay that. I think, to be fair, there were a number of factors in the decision, but common sense dictates that would be one

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [96]

Great. And a totally different question, I don't know, maybe for Trevor. But can you update us on what your company-wide P&amp;L foreign exchange exposure is to the appreciating US dollar? I mean, now that you have ViaWest in there, and I forget if you have any hedging of your sort of US dollar purchases, and what the sort of net impact may be, if we continue to see this US dollar strength?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP, COO   [97]

Sure. On the core business, we roughly have about a CAD300 million exposure on the US dollar, Vince, related to purchasing equipment with respect to modems, and set-top boxes and so on and such forth. I mean, we typically engage in hedging programs where we have -- in the past, we have been around 20% of that exposure hedged. We don't have as much on right now, to be frank

We do, obviously with that natural short position, in the currency we've got a long equity exposure with the ViaWest entity going forward. We are not doing any hedging with respect to the ViaWest operations, obviously, economically it's matched. Their revenue and EBITDA will be used to fund sort of organic capital in the US. But hopefully, that clarifies sort of where our US exposure is at right now

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions)
 Our first question today comes from Jeff Fan of Scotiabank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [2]

I'll start with the question regarding your confidence in the rest of the year, because when we look at your guidance on EBITDA growth for the full year in the range of about 5% to 7%, that kind of implies that we're going to see an acceleration from where you are in the first quarter through the year. So can you talk a little bit about where some of those key drivers are and your level of confidence in getting through some of those drivers and achieving that full-year number?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications - EVP &amp; COO   [3]

Hey, Jeff, it's Jay. Maybe I'll take that one first and talk you through it a little bit. We have great confidence in our guidance and have of course reaffirmed it. We certainly attempted to signal a much lighter Q1 because that's what we saw in our internal numbers, and we're really right on top of our internal numbers in terms of the results that you see today. So we obviously didn't do-- to be transparent, I hear your question. You're not able to necessarily work your way backwards, I mean work your way forward

Let me talk you through it a little bit. I think it's clear and you've now publicly seen the impact of our rate adjustments, which we delayed from September to January, and obviously that created a financial result in the quarter that we delivered. We're quite comfortable with the choice that we made and still think it's the right choice to be made

So that rate adjustment is in the Consumer business, both on Cable and Satellite as we talked about, and I think we gave you a net number after adjustments across the entire Consumer base, including Satellite, of just over CAD3. That might even be a little bit light. Our Business rate adjustments were also on January 1 not as big a number because the base wasn't as big, but still very much significant

The ViaWest number, because of -- and Nancy can give you more detail if you want, because of the way the build has come on and the ramping up of the new markets, the ViaWest number grows fairly dramatically within the year, which was always the plan. And again, is right on top of the number

The one number that we're really not happy with in the quarterly results today, and we can talk about that a little bit later, if you want, is the Business number. But we do get that back on track and into double-digit EBITDA growth rates as you move into quarter 3 and quarter 4

And then a reminder to everybody, the focus to deliver is a three-year transformational effort that we're one year in and I won't say that it's early days, because I think we're about a third of the way through our initiative. There's a number of those initiatives that result in material cost savings in the second half of the year. So those are the ways to get there, and again just to reiterate, the numbers you see today were right on top of our internal numbers and our internal plan

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [4]

I think Jeff just to add to that, a little bit to add to that. We're very comfortable with our strategy and what we're doing and we don't see really this quarter as anything to take us off that and we're still very comfortable with initiatives we have going on at a high level

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [5]

Great. And to follow up, Jay, on the Business number, can you just flush out a little bit on what areas you thought were a little bit weak and then why this is going to improve back to the 10% growth rate?
 And then the follow-on for Nancy on the ViaWest, my understanding is this business can have longer sales cycles. So the confidence through the rest of the year would suggest that a lot of these contracts are not only signed, but are pretty much ready to be deployed or are already being deployed in your business. Wondering if the that's the right way to look at that?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [6]

Why don't we reverse the order and let ViaWest go first

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nancy Phillips,  ViaWest - Co-founder, President &amp; CEO   [7]

Yes, certainly I think what our legacy markets -- clearly we're seeing good continued growth and certainly meeting our expectations on those fronts. I'll remind everybody, we opened two new locations in calendar year 2014, one being Phoenix in the first quarter and Minneapolis in the second. And those are ramping markets for us

So number one, a little bit of ramp cost related to bringing those online and as we scale. And then just timing issues in terms of some of those new contracts. But overall, the pipeline is very good. We're pleased with the progression. We're really looking more at timing based issues and that's the nature of our business a little bit, as we continue to progress through the next couple of quarters. But feel good about top line and bottom line expectations for the year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [8]

Great

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications - EVP &amp; COO   [9]

Great and then Jeff, picking up on the Business result, I think it's fair to say that nobody's happy with this Business result. For context, as we talked about on last call, our Cable business, which is the bulk of what is now being reported in Business network services, has grown at 20% each of the last two years

And we broke that down for you on the last call but the -- with acquisitions two years ago, that was 15% organic and 5% through acquisitions. And last year, 12% organic and 8% through acquisitions. Obviously, 5% EBITDA growth isn't an acceptable result and is headed in the wrong direction

Focus to deliver for us is not just words. It's how we're committed to managing the assets of the business and we're committed to managing those assets with a maturing revenue growth profile just like that, and we're committed to managing our gross assets as a growth asset. And Shaw business network services is clearly a growth asset

So on the focus side and on the deliver side, we've done a tremendous amount of work. A couple months ago we did a deep strategic -- start -- began a deep strategic dive on our Business strategy because clearly while we were all around it, we did not have the crispness in our Business strategy that we currently have in Consumer. That work is now almost complete and I think we have every confidence that our new simplified and [crisp] strategy will yield results

Second part of it is delivery. And speaking plainly, these results are a leadership change result and we made a leadership change in the Shaw business business unit last week. We're pleased to announce that Ron McKenzie has taken over Shaw business. Ron's a seasoned executive with a terrific track record, both at Shaw and in the B2B space, and I'm confident under Ron's leadership we're going to be able to deliver the results that we all know this opportunity provides

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [10]

Great. Thanks for the color

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [11]

The next question comes from Vince Valentini of TD Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [12]

Couple questions on rate increases. Can you talk about any reaction you may have seen to the rate increases in January? And to clarify your CAD3 comment, Jay, that's averaging over all RGUs in Consumer Cable and Satellite, I believe, but you were much more targeted I think. I don't think there were any Cable segment, video or phone rate increases. Maybe you can confirm that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications - EVP &amp; COO   [13]

Right, yes thanks, Vince. In terms of the business, our business is responding well to the changes in rates and certainly our subscriber story in Q2 continues to be strong and our call center activity looks good and churn continues to be directionally in the right direction. For sure this garnered some discussion online and in other forums but we're quite confident in the value equation that we bring to our customer base

And so if you think about Satellite, think about CAD3 to CAD4 increase more on the low end of that for our Satellite base, and I included that when I was talking about the net average of -- in the Consumer business when we talked on the last call. And remember, we talked about low 80%s pull through when you adjust for customers who have lots of choice through packaging and also the promotional impact of customers who are on promotions and then the rate increase doesn't happen until after that

On the Cable, the traditional Cable side of the house, we had primarily Internet increases that affected about two-thirds of our Internet base. And then we had some small bundled instances on TV and phone, not on the individual products, but on the buy throughs on the bundle. And our sense is you're going to net that slightly higher than the CAD3 when all this comes through, you're going to -- could get closer to CAD4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [14]

That's good, Jay, thanks. And second question on rate increases, would you at this point be contemplating going back to the September 1 schedule for rate increases this year so that in Q1 of 2016 you'll have a bit of a double rate increase effect?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications - EVP &amp; COO   [15]

I think we're looking at all of our options. Clearly, we wanted to take some extra time and do a 16-month cycle this go round. I think we're still weighing our options on what that means for FY16

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [16]

Okay. And last one, the equity loss on a joint venture, can you clarify what that is? Would that be shomi?

Nancy Phillips,  ViaWest - Co-founder, President &amp; CEO   [17]

Yes, Vince, that's shomi

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [18]

And is that a one time thing or should we see more of that as the year goes on?

Nancy Phillips,  ViaWest - Co-founder, President &amp; CEO   [19]

Well it'll be a continuation of a pick up every quarter and it's whatever the results will be we'll be picking up our share through the -- that line

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [20]

But do you expect that it was pretty front end loaded with the initial launch cost or is that a pretty good run rate?

Nancy Phillips,  ViaWest - Co-founder, President &amp; CEO   [21]

There was definitely some front end load in there for launch costs and that. But I think it's early to start predicting what the number is going to be

The next question comes from Glen Campbell of Bank of America Merrill Lynch

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [24]

I wanted to dig into operating expenses a little bit for Media first and then on the core Cable business. They were a little higher than we were expecting and I'm wondering on the Media side is that all content costs or was there anything unusual in the quarter? And then the same question on Cable as well. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nancy Phillips,  ViaWest - Co-founder, President &amp; CEO   [25]

On the Media side, yes, primarily that is content cost. First quarter is when all the new American content comes in and the way those first quarter costs roll out is frankly dependent to a great degree on where the cancellations come and go from the American network side

We had a strong fall schedule with no cancellations, which is the good news. It comes with at a little bit higher cost. The underlying operating costs actually are very well contained and actually are well enhanced. So it's a content timing issue for the most part

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications - EVP &amp; COO   [26]

And then on the Consumer side, we've typically lined up our annual increases in September because they coincided with revenue and so they probably haven't been as visible before. For sure, we have our merit increase which happens in September

The largest network rate increases happen in September and there was some additional rate increases on some mandatory carriage services that came out of a CRTC proceeding that impacted us in September. Really, the only other rate increases that we have on network fees is we do have a smaller one that hits us January 1. But the largest single increase is in September

And so I think you've just seen the lineup along with all of the additional activity that comes with back-to-school, the quarter's a relatively [heavy one in spend] when you look at the four quarters of the year and so I think that's why you see some expenses

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [27]

Okay, thanks. And to clarify, it sounds like in both those answers there's nothing really of a one time nature in there, would that be fair?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications - EVP &amp; COO   [28]

I think that's fair

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [29]

We think that's fair, yes

The next question comes from Phillip Huang of Barclays Capital

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [32]

Question on the energy sector. Obviously we've seen some pretty volatile times there. Was wondering what's your visibility to the potential impact to your business, if any at all, as a result of the falling energy price and obviously the Western Canadian economy. I'd imagine that the residential business should be pretty resilient, but wondering if you have any early thoughts of potential impact on the enterprise or SMB side of the business, whether you having exposure at all

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [33]

It is -- we're all living this real time, aren't we, as the way things go and we'll see the impact. But you're right, on the Consumer side there tends to be somewhat more resiliency on these downturns. That being said, there is certainly more choices out these days, so there's that thing you have to take into consideration

On the B2B, as Jay says, we got -- we're very comfortable with the opportunity, where it's going. We've got some new leadership in there. We think there's -- it's about value and we think we bring a lot of value in that space. I think it's even more so in a tighter economy. So I think that's an opportunity for us

And then back to the Consumer side, I think when you look at WiFi and the value proposition it gives, will even resonate even more. And so we're -- that being said, from a macro point of view, there's certainly going to be impact that we have to be aware of but we certainly feel that we have things in a reasonably good spot to continue to grow and have those opportunities just building on what (multiple speakers)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [34]

Do you have any -- are you able to provide -- I know it's very early days because it's happened so rapidly. Was wondering if you guys might be able to tell us what percentage of your customers, say, for example, are exposed to that sector or is that even a relevant analysis from your perspective?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications - EVP &amp; COO   [35]

Yes if the you look at the direct impact in the sector in the B2B space it's not a crazy big number. The RGU number is significant in Northern Alberta and so I think you will see some fluctuation in the RGU number

Those are deals that have been negotiated with best-in-class supply chain organizations, so they're at a relatively low monthly rate and are at relatively low margin. And so I don't think you're going to see a significant financial impact and we're not really in the enterprise space in a big way in oil and gas. So there's not much of a direct impact there

If it's helpful, Dvai put out a piece that suggested about 35% of our Consumer and Business revenue came from Alberta and he was just about bang on. And a reminder to folks that British Columbia is our largest market and represents a percentage of our revenue that starts with a 4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [36]

And that's very helpful. And do you expect the timing of any impact to be relatively it might be a few quarters out or do you think we might actually see it relatively short term?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications - EVP &amp; COO   [37]

We're certainly seeing indication that we'll see -- again, it's not going to move the enterprise number, we'll see some impact in Northern Alberta in Fort McMurray and surrounding communities in the relative short term. I think the other stuff it's pretty early to tell the impact and it's certainly well -- the story has been well reported and I don't know that we have much more color to add to the story than what you've seen; it's what's happening

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [38]

Got it. And then a quick follow up on ViaWest. I know you guys have talked for some time about ViaWest customers demanding a little bit more presence, greater presence in the US East Coast. Can you maybe talk a bit about as you look for opportunities to expand towards that on the ViaWest platform, what are some of the criteria that you'll be using in assessing those opportunities and whether you feel that valuation expectations from potential sellers are relatively reasonable in your view?

Nancy Phillips,  ViaWest - Co-founder, President &amp; CEO   [39]

Yes, this is Nancy. As we said early on, and I think as we, Shaw and ViaWest, came together here in September, we are seeing certainly customer demand. Our existing customers are obviously like the product that they're receiving in the western side of the country where we have obviously deployments and certainly asking us, hey, when is ViaWest going to be in the east. And so it's certainly been top of mind pre-Shaw and remains a solid focus on a strategic level for us

Clearly we're analyzing what are the right markets. So as we look from an organic or potentially through acquisition the opportunity for geographic expansion, we look at both sides of the puzzle and have done a lot of work internally to evaluate where we think that might make sense. And then certainly as you know there's continued consolidation in the industry, but we're always very mindful and disciplined around what's the right criteria

Clearly ViaWest is appealing to a pretty broad set of enterprise customers, mid-sized businesses who are looking for both a combination of not only good data centers, quality operational integrity and rigor, but also looking for that optionality. ViaWest remains one of [only] companies in the country who not only is obviously seeing great opportunity around the data center segment, but also an interest in our hybrid or managed and cloud-based services

So we look for that mix. It's not -- you have to have really good foundational pieces which come in the form of the data center. But yes, it's a very important priority for us and we stay focused on it

The next question comes from Drew McReynolds of RBC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [42]

Three from me. First for perhaps you, Brad. A big picture one, on the Shaw Media side, you did talk recently about going down to the show and seeing obviously all the new technology and obviously you guys are a big technology player and moving all of that forward, lots of change out there. When you acquired Shaw Media, arguably a little bit of a different of a landscape, you've done well with that acquisition from a free cash flow perspective. I'm wondering if you could help us understand how the strategic importance of that asset is evolving as we get into that new world of OTT or however you want to characterize it?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [43]

Well, a couple things to start. First of all, we love the Media business. We look at it, what it generates from a free cash flow point of view, from a margin point of view, which are industry leaders. And so strictly from a business point of view, yes, there's some macro trends we have to be aware of and certainly having impact on the business. But have you to manage that as well as you can

I think you're right, from five years ago or four years ago from where it is now, things have changed quite a bit and content is becoming more and more important. Owning of the content is key. I think we're on top of, in regards to Media, a real change from a regulatory point of view on Let's Talk TV and what is really the impact of that

I think as we look at the Media business, we realize things will be changing, the whole environment is changing and we want to make sure we've looked at things. And as we see things to invest in, an opportunity where it makes sense, we want to do that. But we really want to see what the rules are going to be and what the playing field is going to be. But the marketing power we get, the TV Everywhere strategy has worked so well, those things are things we wouldn't be able to do. And we love the brands

And we love what we're able to do and we think there's still opportunity to recreate things. And like any business, you have to reskin it and re-have a look and that's what we're doing and constantly doing that. And we'll find -- there is -- things aren't as easy as shown but I think we know that the content is still very important to us and it's just a matter of how we continue to make sure we can have it grow and manage it well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [44]

Okay, appreciate those comments. And then my second and third question, first on the Satellite subscriber losses, wondering if you can give us, not necessarily a specific breakdown, but just some color around those losses due to cord cutting versus competition?
 And then maybe Barb for you on shomi, is there anything you can update us with in terms of traction, success, things that maybe are performing above or below expectations?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications - EVP &amp; COO   [45]

Sure. We can start with Satellite and then we'll pass to Barb. We'll -- reminding everyone of the seasonality of Satellite with Q1 being the weakest and I think you've seen the comparable number last year on the Consumer side at 11. The Q2 and Q4 are the stronger numbers and we've certainly seen normal seasonality and we'll see a better result in Q2, just because it's a better time of year for us in the Satellite business

Maybe I'll insert a comment on 30-day disconnects in a minute, just to qualify that so that we understand where we're talking about it. We have not seen an increase in cord cutting across any of our businesses. We're seeing a steady state in the video business. And it certainly impacts the Cable market much more significantly than the Satellite market because of the rural nature of our Satellite business

Just before I pass to Barb, as we're talking about subscriber numbers, we would like to remind everybody of the 30-day disconnect change and that in November the CRTC did their first part of their Talk TV and eliminated the 30-day notice period. We are actually implementing that tomorrow, January 15, so we don't have exact numbers to provide for you, but we currently and we have had 30-day disconnect notices across all of our lines of businesses

So that'll be a significant negative RGU in Q2. So we're headed into that change. We're quite happy with where we are. Our sense is that negative RGU change is likely in the 20,000 to 35,000 RGU level. We'll be able to release to you our November 30 pending RGU disconnects and our February 28. So we'll know by the time the next time we talk and people will be able -- we'll certainty do that math

I wish I could give you more precision but because this is the way we've done business and the way the industry has done business, we just really aren't able to provide completely how much of it is customer choice and how much is 30 day and what the behavior of the consumer will be in this new environment. So just wanted to put that caveat in. And then I'll pass over to Barb

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Barb Williams,  Shaw Media - EVP &amp; President   [46]

Sure, thanks, Jay. I would say overall we're quite pleased actually with the way shomi has rolled out. It's only been a product out there for a little over a couple of months and it's been well received and well picked up to date. It's been interesting to see how much enthusiasm there's been for using the product through set top box. And as predicted, we are seeing the TV product that we've been able to provide being really well used

All of that said, it's a product that's still in beta. So it's very early stages for us still. We're -- as I say early signs are very positive but we have lots of interesting work to do with the product going forward

The next question is from Tim Casey of BMO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [49]

Brad, could you update us on how you're approaching payout ratios? Because if we don't adjust free cash flow for the accelerated capital fund, the payout ratios on free cash flow are quite high. So do you just ignore that and are you confident that beyond 2015 there will be a significant drop in the absolute level of capital spend or do you anticipate there'll be more projects that you'll have to bring online? And wondering how we should think about payout ratios going forward. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [50]

Well, a couple things, and maybe the guys want to add a bit. We're very -- as we look at it and we look at the track record and how we've been able to manage the business over the years, how we've been able to strategically invest where it's required that makes sense into high yielding businesses and returning capital to shareholders. And as we see forward and as we see everything we've been able to do this year really gives us some comfort going forward that we can manage free cash flow, that the profile of this Company and free cash flow growth is exciting

And from -- when you look at it from a CapEx point of view, and I think we gave some guidance last call on a Cable core of CAD750 million CapEx, very comfortable with that. And I know the guys might have a little number with some of the other things added in there on a year-over-year basis

But I -- we look at the business and we want to manage the business as well as we can and we think there's plenty of opportunities we have and we'll continue to capitalize that, such as focus to deliver and such as our WiFi strategy and our focus around broadband and the growth of Shaw business and ViaWest tied together is exciting

So we -- I can't say that I have a target in mind. I think 80% seems to -- it makes sense as you look going forward for us. But Tim, I can't say it should be 75%, 70% or that. We just really manage the business very well and really see the opportunities as we go forward to make those decisions then

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications - SVP Corporate Development &amp; Capital Markets   [51]

And maybe I'll just add, Tim, it's Trevor. When you look at the dividend increase this year that's about CAD530 million of the dividend obligation, and if you look at our free cash flow guidance of CAD650 million, that's our 80% payout ratio for this year and this of course is the last year for ACF

So if you want to -- however you want to treat ACF in your payout ratios we'd hope that when you look forward you could see that we've got that additional flexibility in our free cash flow profile for -- to fund the dividend and the dividend growth. And of course, that doesn't contemplate any of the numbers around the actual cash savings that's in place related to the DRIP that we still have roughly, 25% to 30% dividend or participation rate

And in terms of long-term CapEx, like Brad said, I think we gave guidance last quarter again of the CAD750 million on the long term. I mean, it's a little -- with the new reporting structures now, it's a little bit different but we still feel comfortable in those figures in terms of the overall Canadian CapEx within the business of being roughly CAD850 million over the long term

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [52]

And just backing up Trevor's math, so we said core Cable CapEx, think about it around CAD750 million. Accelerated capital fund, we sold some non strategic assets in order to make some investments. We would make the argument that those investments have worked and they've given us a differentiated Internet product. But the segmentation, it's kind of hard to break capital between Consumer and Business because a fibre node is -- you end up with a bunch of allocations

So take that CAD750 million run rate and add CAD100 million to that for the combination of Satellite and Media capital and think about an ongoing capital run rate of around CAD850 million in Canada. And that would include all elements of our business in Canada including any data center investment in Canada. So really the only thing excluded from that general way of thinking about the business is capital on the ViaWest side in the US

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [53]

Which is running somewhere around CAD85 million in Canadian dollars these days, is that fair?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications - SVP Corporate Development &amp; Capital Markets   [54]

That's correct. I think we're still comfortable with that. And it's a little light this quarter just from a timing perspective again

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [55]

Got you. That's great, very helpful. Thanks for the color

Operator   [56]

The next question is from Dvai Ghose of Canaccord Genuity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [57]

In the past one of my concerns was that your accelerated CapEx may have to be extended beyond this fiscal year because of the need to do an IPTV overlay in order to defend your Cable customer base. But despite the lack of a IPTV overlay your Cable subscriber losses have really moderated. Do you -- you have in the past talked about a goal of an IPTV overlay, companies like Rogers still do and they've extended their timetable again and again. Do you still see that need given the fact your Cable asset seems to be performing a lot better at least in terms of defense of basic subs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications - EVP &amp; COO   [58]

Thanks, Dvai, it's Jay. So a couple of comments on that. We are quite confident that within that CAD850 million Canadian number that there's lots of flexibility for us to make the choices that we need to make and so we certainly don't see any step change investments in the business that we're in in Canada and we think we can move forward on that basis

We continue to do a tremendous amount of work around next generation video. I think you've seen us -- you'll see us proceed in a way not dissimilar to how the industry is proceeding. We're continuing to deploy hybrid IP Cable set tops, focusing on the IP user interface first and transitioning multi year over time

So I don't think there's any question that over the course of the next 5 to 10 years there'll be a significant movement of the base towards next generation video. But it's going to come in a -- we think it's going to come just as the other members of cable [apps] think in a measured way, hybrid approach and nothing scary in the transition

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [59]

That's cool. Do you see any need to outsource people like TiVo in the interim as your peers at Cogeco have?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications - EVP &amp; COO   [60]

For sure we're going to need partners. The days of being able to do things all on your own aren't there. We understand, we think Cogeco's made an interesting choice and it's a good choice. We're not -- I don't think we're in a position at this point to release the group of partners. It's not a single partner and it's not TiVo

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [61]

Fair enough, no that sounds good. Secondly, in terms of telephony, I guess for the first time since you rolled out in 2005 you saw albeit a modest, but nonetheless a contraction in the base in the quarter. I assume that this is wireless substitution and if it is I'm wondering if it makes you rethink MVNOs or some sort of relationship with a new entrant in Canada?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications - EVP &amp; COO   [62]

It is substitution for sure. And I think it's a little bit strategy too, Dvai. Brad is leading us into becoming a network and content experience Company. And we have over the years pushed really hard, trying to sell home phone to university students and things like that. And I'm not sure that's -- I don't know that we want to spend a lot of time there

Philosophically where we sit today is we want our customers to take services from us that they see great value in and we want them to take more of it. And so if you're an Internet customer and you just want Internet from Shaw, we're going to -- we want you to buy as much Internet as possible. We think we've got some great pricing models in WiFi to do that

If you want to take Internet and video from Shaw, we'd love to do business with you and find the right level of service. If you're a triple play customer and we've got a very loyal triple play base that still values phone and what's neat about this segmentation of our phone base is the portion of the face -- the base that values phone, they actually really value home phone

So I think it's a change in sales philosophy that we're really not trying to value-add phone at almost no cost in the bundles to give it to a segment of the market that it doesn't appeal to

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [63]

Yes, that makes sense. And then the last one, a bit of an early financial one. Working cap is seasonal obviously in Q1, normally has a negative swing for you. But it was CAD174 million negative swing in this quarter, which is pretty big. Is there any reason for that? And could we expect that to be reversed during the course of the year?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications - SVP Corporate Development &amp; Capital Markets   [64]

Dvai, it's Trevor. We'll take that one offline and maybe get back to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Dvai Ghose,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [65]

Yes, that's fair. All right, thanks very much, guys

Operator   [66]

The next question comes from Greg MacDonald of Macquarie Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [67]

Wanted to ask actually more of a strategic question. So I'm thinking about the change in subscriber viewing habits. And in doing so I'm recently wondering if cable cos and especially cable cos like Shaw that have a differentiated broadband product, wonder if these companies are willing to allow or think about lower ARPU in cable if in fact the quid pro quo is a proportionately higher ARPU in broadband? So what I'm asking is based on the mix of the rate increases that you just put through, is there some permanency to that strategy or was that a one time thing for competitive reasons?
 And then a second part of that question would be even after this rate increase on broadband, do you think you still have the pricing power relative to your competitor that you can still increase rates based on the fact that you've got this WiFi related product?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications - EVP &amp; COO   [68]

Great, thank you. I think when you think about ARPUs, we've seen this over a number of years with video ARPU dropping and Internet ARPU increasing. And we really embraced a much greater level of customer choice if you look at our CAD40 personal TV package and what we've done with the small theme packs that we've been in market with three years already. You've seen customers take less and less video from us over that period of time and really find their way

And we'll see -- it's premature to think about where Talk TV is going to take us. We think there's somewhat less exposure in the competitive markets in Canada, because we've already been through some of that readjustments where customers have gone off the traditional tiers where they had to take unrelated services and transitioned into these lighter packages. And so that's happening in the business already

On the question of value on our Internet services, we think our Internet services offer terrific value. It hasn't been widely reported but we did launch on January 6 an Internet 5 meg product that's actually at a lower price point than our previous Internet service and is certainly the lowest price point in the marketplace. And we think that's a terrific product. It's got 60 gigs in data, includes a WiFi device and so we think we're very competitive in the market

If you walk through our prices, we've always been at a very small premium to our competitor, but we think we get there in terms of value. So I think it's premature having just been through this current to think about what might happen next. But we think we're very well positioned competitively in the Internet space

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [69]

Okay, thanks, Jay. And then a quick follow-on on that in terms of ability to offer more, if the market all of a sudden went aggressively, much more aggressively, toward online video, what's the potential for the Company right now? You can talk technologies like the ability to bond more channels together or whatnot. What's the potential for the Company right now to make a significant uptick 100 meg product, stuff like that?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications - EVP &amp; COO   [70]

Our network is in good shape. We've got a three-year technology and product road map that manages all of the levers in terms of capacity and customer growth and our ability to adjust. So we have greater flexibility than we have ever had

That having been said, one of the things that we've learned about Internet speeds is you don't want to get there ahead of the customer. A couple of years ago we were giving away 50 meg Internet services to all new customers and you weren't segmenting the marketplace for customers that value the additional speed and value the additional usage. And all of that not only drives speed but there's a pretty linear relationship between speed and data usage and network capacity

So we like where we are today with CAD10 increments for the various speed components. We think it finds a right balance of terrific customer value and segmenting the marketplace. There's no real network driver to prevent us from making changes in the short term. In the medium term, though, I don't know that it makes sense to get ahead of your customers and drive speed changes beyond that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [71]

And finally -- thanks for that, by the way -- finally, could you give us an update on the percentage of your broadband customers that actually use the WiFi infrastructure? And is there any way to measure the value the customer puts on WiFi as an addition to their home broadband? Is there like customer satisfaction stuff that you can quote or something like that?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications - EVP &amp; COO   [72]

Yes, great. So 30% of our base uses WiFi and because you only have to authenticate once, that's an extremely active base. The likelihood to recommend of our Shaw Go WiFi is deep into the 80s, likelihood to recommend to their friends and family, which is really the money question for us. Interestingly enough, for the customers who use Shaw Go WiFi, it's actually driven the likelihood to recommend of Shaw's Internet overall into the high 80s, which is the score we haven't come close to seeing in the past

We're also seeing a nice increase in likelihood to switch from our competitors because of WiFi. So there's lots of good directional things in the marketplace. I don't know if Brad wants to add

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [73]

Only from example, we did a little test. Community WiFis are municipal deals where the WiFi is open to all, anyone that lives or comes into the network. And so in a community we did a little test over about a month and we opened up all the WiFi, not only the community WiFi, but everything else. And year over year we saw over a 50% increase in Internet subscriptions with the same -- basically the same offer. So we're playing around with those things. We're just seeing what works and what opportunity is. But we get pretty excited about what we could do and the potential of it

The next question comes from Maher Yaghi of Desjardins

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [80]

Guys, I have three quick questions I want to ask you. The first one is can you talk about the business drivers that drove you to delay the price increases that you made this year to stake them to 16 months? Maybe you can tell us what you were waiting to see in the marketplace that drove you to extend the price increases time line

Second question is can you quantify the impact of the move to a six-month promo cycle from three months or if you can't put a number -- if you don't want to put a number on it, maybe can you talk about how much of the extension has passed through the cost structure on the consumer side so far?
 And third of all, thirdly, since you launched shomi, can you talk a little bit about if you saw any kind of resistance or move by customers to downgrade their TV packages and to opt to take shomi in your consumer space?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications - EVP &amp; COO   [81]

We can start in terms a few of the business drivers. Pricing and packaging is one of the most important decisions that a business makes. And certainly in a business like ours, it's something we take very seriously, do a tremendous amount of analysis and segmentation and have a look at where we are relatively in the marketplace

When we were looking at the traditional September base and it came time, and with back office systems and other things you need to make this call a little bit in advance, we weren't totally sure that it was the right move. We took a step back. We did some additional research and the marketplace settled down a bit and there was also a competitive rate increase that was announced from a competitor, our primary competitor in October, which certainly was also on the Internet and, therefore, struck that the marketplace might hold. I think those are a sense of the timing and discussion, but they're complicated decisions

In terms of the promo cycle, and it's hard to quantify that. I think we're quite comfortable with where we are from a promotional point of view. We're not driving rich promotions in the marketplace. And we don't think you'll see -- I think you'll see some nice stability from us on the promo side. I'll pass to Barb on the shomi question

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Barb Williams,  Shaw Media - EVP &amp; President   [82]

Sure, I think one of the interesting things about some of these types of services is that they seem to lead more to stacking than they do to cutting. And certainly our early experience with shomi in this beta phase has been that customers seem to be liking the added opportunity of shomi as opposed to seeing it as an opportunity to cut or decrease their video package

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [83]

Okay. And to go back on the promo cycle, can you maybe just tell us if most of the impact of the promo and extension to six months has gone and passed through on the cost structure or we should expect some additional cost to be incurred in the second quarter?

Barb Williams,  Shaw Media - EVP &amp; President   [84]

No, it's pretty much passed through now. So it really was impacted in August of the prior year. So you're really just seeing it now, this is the final [cord] coming through

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [85]

Okay, great. Thank you very much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [86]

Okay. Thank you, Operator. Thanks, everyone

Operator   [87]

Thank you, Mr. Shaw. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating and have a pleasant day.

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions)
 The first question is from Bob Bek of CIBC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [2]

Thanks, good afternoon. A couple of questions. Just a big picture one, perhaps, for Brad to start off

Can you update us your thoughts on the Alberta economy and the effect upon Shaw? I know you talked about it last quarter. We're obviously getting more data and more anecdotal evidence of issues. So, just your current thoughts on the potential effect upon Shaw, whether it be jobs or pricing. And then I have a follow-up question, as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [3]

Sure, Bob, thanks. There's no doubt we continue closely to monitor the impact of lower commodity prices in western Canadian economy and the impacts on our business. I can tell you that I think a lot of us were caught off guard by the dramatic shift in pricing of oil, but I'm certainly confident that the Canadian energy sector will weather the storm and get through this current period of volatility

We have seen, there has been some job losses in Alberta. I would say the last six months around 30,000. But as I look at it on a big picture scale, a 5.3% unemployment rate in Alberta is quite a bit lower than the national average of 5.9%. And I also look at where we operate elsewhere in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, would be the two lowest unemployment rates in Canada,

But you also look back, Bob, at history and you go -- in these times of tough economic challenges, the value proposition of broadband in the home, we think, is still key. The TV entertainment bundle even becomes more valuable, I think, in this, as you look at shows and movies and going out to dinner. So, that whole comparison I think is relative and puts us in somewhat stronger shape

But that being said, lots more choices on video these days, as you look at it, and we know that. But we really think with our TV Everywhere, with Show Me, with Shaw Go WiFi really positions us well with customers to help manage their costs and manage the share of the wallet

And just on that, as we look at our Wi-Fi base, I think we have over two-thirds of customers actually say the service helps them avoid mobile data costs. We can reinforce that but it's a great value proposition

On the business side, I tend to look at it and say we have more and more exposure to the vertical -- that's correct -- in oil and gas. But as we look at it we're a very small component of their overall costs. When I look at costs increasing there's other segments, when you look at construction and labor, that has gone up a lot more than the services we would provide

And I also tend to think when you're offering fiber and Internet and telecom and voice, they tend to be services that are pretty sticky and that are somewhat essential. So, there's no doubt. And then just on that a little bit more on the business side, there is going to be some impact on the hospitality side as we look at some of the camps up north and some of the challenges there. We'll have to duly manage it but there will be a small impact from that

And just on the size and scope of things, we talked about Alberta being about 35% of our overall business. BC's in the mid 40%s, low 40 percentage. You look at our diversification with Shaw Media right across the country, we look at ViaWest diversification in the US, gives us some comfort that we can weather the storm. We're somewhat diversified in this regard and we feel relatively good about that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bob Bek,  CIBC World Markets - Analyst   [4]

That's a lot of info. Thank you. Actually my second question was on the business side so you answered that. So, thanks very much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [5]

The next question is from Jeff Fan of Scotiabank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [6]

Thanks, good afternoon. A few questions. First maybe start off on the subscribers. If we exclude the 30-day impact of 30,000 or 35,000 on the consumer side we still saw a bit of a slowdown or an increase in the losses. I'm wondering if you can just talk about each specific line and help us think about where you saw some improvement in strength and where you saw some deterioration in terms of adds from a year-over-year basis. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [7]

Hi, Jeff it's Jay. When you look at the subscriber numbers for the quarter, we certainly appreciate that it's a noisy quarter with the 30-day disconnects, and there's a little bit of a lack of precision in the numbers. The story, though, for us is a clear story, and it's one around home phone. And I think we've talked a little about this but I don't know that we've given clear context

We've had a shift in strategy in how we approach home phone. We used to move forward very much with triple-play bundles and trying on promotional basis and trying to onboard all of our customers with a triple-play, and make our promotions structure in that way so that it was really to your incentive to take triple-play whether you wanted it or not

We've moved away from that to single play onboarding. We want our customers to take the services that they value. And as a result we had an understandably tough home phone quarter and I think we're going to have a tough home phone quarter for the next quarter or two as we work our way through those six-month promotions

I think when you look at the business we're quite comfortable with that segmented approach to home phone. We want to sell home phone to a customer who wants home phone. Our experience with the triple-play promotions were your customer would take home phone for the first six months, they really wouldn't pay you anything for it of significance, and then the churn rates were quite high as you moved to regular billing. So I think the softness that you're seeing is a home phone story

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [8]

So, on to the internet then. Would you say that the trends on internet is still, if you were to exclude the 30-day cancellation impact, would you say the adds were positive and still show, exhibit the positive trend that we've been seeing for the last couple of quarters?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [9]

Yes, for sure. Certainly the adds are positive on internet. I think to be fair -- and again we've given you approximate numbers because there's only so much precision -- to be fair, we're a few thousand lower in terms of our number of adds in Internet to the quarter. But we certainly don't see anything to read too terribly much into that. But we were certainly nicely positive for the quarter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [10]

Okay. And then just stepping back, if we think about the competitive landscape and also capital spending that's required to maintain competition, to maintain your competitiveness, TELUS is talking about spending more on capital with fiber-to-the-home now

You guys obviously went through a spending with ACF and that's supposed to drop down going into 2016. Is there anything that you've seen in the last little while that would suggest that you need to pick up your spending again or maintain at ACF going into 2016 or are you still pretty comfortable that, given your capital budgets for this year and also the step down going into next year, that you can continue to be very competitive against your key players?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [11]

Thanks, Jeff. We're very comfortable. We've done a tremendous amount of work on the capital side of the business, I think. When you look at the decrease in capital spending year over year, both in terms of the core capital and the decrease from FY15 in terms of the ACF spend, I'd hate to have you left with the impression that that meant we were, by definition, doing that much less

A huge part of Focus to Deliver has been our strategic sourcing initiatives and our capital allocation discussions, and we're certainly getting way more bang for our buck from our capital spend as a result of that. There's no question that ACF ends with this fiscal year, and that we have the flexibility going forward to make all kinds of choices in terms of fiber and next-generation video and the investments that we need to make to be competitive

So, the story you are seeing here in terms of the weak first half and the stronger second half of this year is the story that we've talked about throughout. And there certainly isn't anything that gives us pause about the free cash flow characteristics of the business going forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [12]

Okay, thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [13]

The next question is from Vince Valentini of TD Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [14]

Yes, thanks very much. A couple things. First, let me stick with CapEx. If I look at the segments you provide, the CapEx for new housing development was up 38% year over year in the quarter, and for the year to date it's up 18%

It seems a bit surprising given what we're seeing in terms of new home sales and starts in Alberta. Can you give any context? Is there some sort of timing issue with that number or is it all BC and Saskatchewan? What's going on?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [15]

There's a little lumpiness in the number. It certainly doesn't translate to consumer housing starts. It also includes some fiber builds and other things that we have invested in the quarter. And clearly we're making significant fiber investments as we build out to new subscribers. There's certainly a little bit of lumpiness there but some of it is just investment in network which we think is healthy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [16]

So, we shouldn't use that as a leading indicator of new home growth in the second half of the year, is what you're saying Jay?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [17]

I would say you weight it partially that. We live and work in Calgary and if you look around at the number of cranes that we have on residential developments in this town right now, it's still going good. People are finishing what they started and so I think you're going to see a nice housing start number in terms of developers finishing what they start

We're less bullish on new starts where there aren't currently holes in the ground. So I think you're seeing that factor, as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [18]

Okay. And then let me ask on the cost reduction, maybe for you as well, Jay. We see the restructuring charge and CAD25 million savings. Should we start to see that flow through in the third quarter? And is it just the CAD25 million from the call center activity or are there some other Focus to Deliver initiatives from prior quarters that will start to ramp up in terms of OpEx savings in Q3 and Q4?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [19]

You're going to continue to see the Focus to Deliver OpEx savings. We've got 11 work streams that we're working on. We've now completed 4 of the 11 work streams. And we're declaring call centers complete in that we've announced our plans, we haven't worked our way through it

You'll see some of that savings in the second half of this year from the call centers specifically. You'll see more of it next year. To declare the CAD25 million number is through the service excellence program in the call center as we hit complete implementation

So, some of that for sure is a reduction of staffing. Much more of it, though, is anchored in what we're actually doing around the service excellence initiative

And just to catch everybody up on what we've done with our call centers is, as we've bought cable systems over the years, every cable system has its own call center. In each call center we did sales calls, we did billing calls, we did technical support calls, we did collection calls, we did field support calls. So, you had this disparate group of call centers all across the country all trying to do the same things in a distributed manner

This is fundamentally a shift in how we deliver the customer experience by going to not only a much smaller number of call centers but a center of excellence formula so that we only do two or three things and we do them really well in each of the markets we serve. So that CAD25 million is both a reduction in headcount and also all of the efficiencies that come with the focus in service excellence models that we're implementing nationally. So, heavy lifting, you'll certainly see that starting materially in FY16 and then rolling as FY16 rolls out

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [20]

That's great color, thanks. And one last related thing is just the restructuring charges. If you're only down 4 of 11 work streams and you took a CAD38 million charge this quarter, does that mean we should expect more charges as you complete the projects in future quarters?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [21]

I can start and then maybe we'll let Rhonda finish. There's certainly some media activity that's happened that's been announced

In many ways, Focus to Deliver is a 36-month transformation initiative that we're now 15 months in. In many ways we front loaded the heavy hard lifting so that most of that heavy hard lifting is behind us. So I don't think you'll see a continuous stream as we go through the rest

The other key initiatives, there's probably not rocket surgery to Focus to Deliver, things like accelerated self-serve, things like self-install. And some of the more technology-based deliverables happen as we roll into the second half of Focus to Deliver and those don't drive the same kind of restructuring charges

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rhonda Bashnick,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP of Finance   [22]

Yes I'll just confirm, Jay, to your comments. Yes, we'll see something probably next quarter with respect to the media restructuring that we just announced. And then I would expect that that's going to start to diminish as we go forward because a lot of these initiatives are, to Jay's point, there's not restructuring charges necessarily associated with them directly

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [23]

Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [24]

The next question is from Glen Campbell of Bank of America Merrill Lynch

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [25]

Yes, thanks very much. A couple small ones to start. The [history] on Sirius Plus would have affected the revenue comparison in media. Could you give us a sense of how big that might have been?

Rhonda Bashnick,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP of Finance   [26]

Yes, it was about CAD1 million. If you normalize those results for history on Sirius Plus, it's about CAD1 million

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [27]

Okay, great. Quite small then. And then in the core cable and satellite business OpEx, was that a clean number this quarter or were there any unusual expenses?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [28]

Yes. I'd say two things on that, Glen. One is we have some Q2 seasonal expense changes that if you go back over the last three or four years are always there. I don't know that have ever quite been reflected in the forecast

The two primary drivers is the way CPP and EI kicks in January 1, which is not an insignificant number when you're comparing Q1 to Q2. And then one of our two major network deals with the vertically integrated companies has its rate increase January 1. So, you see those two things and you've seen them in all of our Q2s over the last number of years

And then most of the restructuring charge of all the changes that we made in the quarter are in the restructuring charge. I think it's fair to say there's some of those costs are a much smaller number than it ended up above the line that you see in our OpEx

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [29]

Okay, that's very helpful, thanks. And, Jay, a more general question. The Commission's decision on program packaging actually gives you a lot of flexibility about whether to promote packages like you have today or smaller packages or pick and pay or a la carte. If you look forward a few years what do you think will be the dominant form of packaging? As you envision the way you're likely to price and put it out there, do you think it's likely to be pick and pay or more like the current program or in between?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [30]

Glen, let me start and I'll get Jay to add a little bit. Just on Let's Talk TV I think we're certainly satisfied with it. The Commission has introduced a measured approach and balances increasing choice for Canadians, which we're all about, while providing the industry some flexibility and an opportunity to innovate and invest

We're also very pleased with the orderly implementation and new opportunities which I think just reflects the overall consultative and collaborative approach that was taken with all constituents

I think with respect to the financial impact on our business, I'll give you a sense. From a distribution point of view we certainly think that we don't expect any material impact on the business. To give you a sense, we think that, most importantly, the founding decision is based on customer choice in providing that principle, and that is definitely in our corporate DNA. And we really feel that we have a good opportunity to continue to grow that

The big thing, of course, in the distribution business is the skinny basic, and that the reduction in price, which excludes rental equipment and I think HD, is largely offset by savings in programming and other costs on the EBITDA margin. We think it is a small reduction on the EBITDA side but it still allows us to offer existing packages, it still allows us to market small theme packs. And when I look at our overall survey, and as we talk to customers, we have 80% that are very happy with what they got, and we really think we continue to be in good shape there to be able to have the flexibility to give customers what they want, meanwhile continuing to provide more and more choice

And just a little bit in media -- and sorry I'm going on here but I got lots to talk about on Let's Talk TV -- genre protection elimination, and I think skinny basic are the two key things in media. We already think there's quite blurred lines with genre protection and we think the elimination is manageable. We always look at our core brands and services and say that's really the strength of what we have and it is truly about brand and content

So, we're comfortable there. It gives us an opportunity to exploit the brands even greater across these off limit genres that were there that we couldn't go before. So, we see an opportunity there

But there's no doubt as you look at it, for us we see stronger channels but fewer. And as proliferation of pick and pay grows that may change. But I think as we look at it we also realize that we have some great core services we want to focus on. We want to make sure we continue to support going forward as consumers choose

But, listen, change is in the air. We're going to manage it very well and feel pretty comfortable that we're going to be able to do that. The skinny basic won't really impact media in FY15. I think you'll start to see that more in FY16 as things become implemented

But, lastly, there's a few small carrots in this season that allows us, that the Commission looked, that gives us more opportunity to grow content more primetime, as I would call it, we call rookie blue in those auctions. And so there's good opportunity there

It's not without challenges. Don't ever get me wrong that we think the world is great and we're not going to be able to do that. Of course we have to manage, of course we have to be able to adjust. But generally we think it's very manageable

We think not only is it manageable but there's an opportunity for us to create new packages and new opportunities and serve Canadians in a different way in certain consumer segments. So, we're going to take this and look at how we can create more opportunity versus going the other way. Sorry for jumping in there but I had to give you a little color on that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [31]

That's great. Thanks very much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [32]

The next question is from Phillip Huang of Barclays

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Philip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [33]

Hi, thanks, good afternoon. My question is I think we saw some promotional activity near the end of the quarter on the cable side. I think, from what I was able to observe, some offers extending promotions, a promotional period from 6 to 12 months. Was just wondering if you could give us a quick update on the competitive landscape, and whether there's been any notable change beyond just a temporary increase in promotions at quarter end, and whether any of the promotions were at all a response to perhaps how the market might have reacted to the rate increase that was put in in January

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [34]

Great. It's Jay again. Maybe I'll take that question in reverse and do rate increase first and then promotions second. What we can tell you about the rate increase -- and again we've got a bit of a cloudy mucky data quarter because of the 30-day disconnect timing coinciding almost precisely with the rate increase timing -- we implemented the change in 30-day disconnects January 15 so that gave you double the disconnects from January 15 to February 15 almost. Because of that, you can't be too precise

What I can tell you is there's no material difference in the stickiness of this rate increase than previous rate increases. And we can see no material evidence that it drove increased disconnects

We also can tell you that our key measure in our business is our customers likelihood to recommend Shaw to their friends and family. And while we saw a very slight 2 percentage dip in January, it rebounded nicely and is actually ahead today of where it was prior to rate increase. So, we haven't seen a noticeable brand or recommendation hit in terms of our rate increase

In terms of promotional activity, I think it's fair to say that through the fall we had somewhat increased promotional activity that was in the marketplace on both sides. We've seen that come down nicely in terms of our gross promotional discount over the course of the last six weeks or so

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Philip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [35]

Got it. Okay. And just to clarify, I don't know if this was addressed earlier but was wondering, the 30-day cancellation policy impact, do you guys have any visibility as to what that would be for the remainder of the year in fiscal Q3 and fiscal Q4?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [36]

There won't be a subscriber impact because the subscriber impact was taken in that 30-day period where you had the disconnect that had given 30-day notice between December 15 and January 15. Plus, any disconnect that happened from January 15 to February 15 there was no requirement. All of that subscriber impact was outlined in the quarter. And I think Rhonda you had given financial guidance

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rhonda Bashnick,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP of Finance   [37]

Yes. We've included just our estimate of the monthly revenue and EBITDA impact. We had given an amount there for the 7.5 months and you can gross that out for a 12-month go-forward impact. But it really is an ongoing reduction in your run rate from Q1 going forward now

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Philip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [38]

Got it. So, no subscriber impact beyond. Okay, that's a helpful clarification. And then, finally, was wondering if you could give us an update on your progress for the transition of your TV platform towards IP and what related CapEx projects you expect to see over the next 12 to 18 months or so related to this initiative. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [39]

Yes, Philip I would simply say that I cannot wait for the call when I'll be able to answer this question. We really look forward to that call and I think it's going to come soon. I'll say to you that when we are able to answer the question, if we land where we think we're going to land today, you won't mind the direction

In terms of what it means from a capital perspective there's nothing scary in it. We've got a hybrid approach to our transition, as we've talked about before. We've got a multi-year road map, and all of that is factored and funded in the capital direction we've been giving people

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Philip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [40]

Sounds very exciting. So, is it like within the next 12 months type initiative? Or can we expect some sort of announcement within the next 12 months or is it farther out?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [41]

No, I think you can expect some sort of announcement in the next 12 months. How many more calls can we do this?

Philip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [42]

Thanks very much for that. Looking forward to it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [43]

The next question is from Drew McReynolds of RBC Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [44]

Thanks very much. Couple questions. Just wondering if you could give us a sense of, from the restructuring charges taken last year in FY14, how much of the CAD50 million in cost savings are we now seeing it in the number this quarter?
 And a second question maybe for you Barb. Obviously we saw the press release around the reorganization at Shaw Media. Just wondering if you could help us out in terms of how that better positions that segment for obviously the big changes that are coming

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Barb Williams,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; President of Shaw Media   [45]

I'll start and give you updated estimated restructuring charge last year. We had put out an estimated savings on an annualized basis of about CAD50 million and we are seeing that come in. That was the reduction in the headcount that we saw. It's about CAD12.5 million in the quarter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rhonda Bashnick,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP of Finance   [46]

I would say from the media point of view we were accomplishing a couple of things with that restructure last week. One of them was certainly just tightening down on our traditional broadcast business. As that business flattens out we know we need to be even tighter on cost. So, part of the 90-plus exits was about just continuing to manage costs very tightly on our broadcast business

And then the other part of that was about positioning ourselves to play in a larger media space going forward beyond just the traditional broadcasting company. So, about 40 new positions brought back into the Company that are all with a new skill set around new kinds of content, new kinds of platforms and new kinds of advertising products. So, partly a battening down the hatches on the traditional business and partly repositioning to play more successfully in a wider media space

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [47]

Okay, that's great. Thanks for that. And maybe just a final question, maybe for you, Peter. Just with respect to cord cutting, it's clearly a recent phenomenon, relatively speaking. Just wondering, because you're seeing near term some economic weakness in Alberta, I'm curious to know whether we get accelerated substitution in the bad times, so to speak. We obviously haven't been through that cycle from a cord-cutting issue. Just wondering if you're seeing any evidence of that or if you can provide some perspective on what you think would happen in that kind of scenario?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [48]

It's Jay again. I'll take a crack at that. We haven't seen any evidence of increased cord cutting as a trend yet. We're certainly staying very close to that. As Brad alluded to in his comments on the economy, when we've had downturns in the past, we've done very well but it's fair to say consumers had fewer choices than they have today. So we're certainly staying very close to that

You heard Brad's message around value and everything that we're doing on value. We continue to drive Shaw Go WiFi. We love that almost 70% of our Shaw Go WiFi customers think that it saves them money on their cellular data charges. And we would love to see some of that substitution come the other way

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [49]

Okay, thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [50]

The next question is from Tim Casey of BMO Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [51]

Yes, thanks, a couple for me. First, just on the media restructuring, should we assume the charge is similar in magnitude to what went through this quarter or will it be smaller than that?

Rhonda Bashnick,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP of Finance   [52]

The media restructure charges that will come in in Q3 are distinctly different and lower from the restructuring charges you would have seen second quarter related to the larger Shaw business

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [53]

Got you, thank you. Just coming back to CapEx, I just want to be clear. The ACF expires at the end of this year but it sounds like you're leaving your options wide open to bring in future projects? Or should we assume that level of spending goes away and does not come back?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [54]

You should assume that level of spending goes away and does not come back. We've generally modeled on the Canadian business and signaled to the markets, I believe, on the last call

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [55]

It was CAD850 million on the Canadian-wide CapEx

 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [56]

Do you expect to fund your road map to IP-TV and others on that CAD850 million?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [57]

Yes, absolutely -- and some other choices that we have the flexibility to make within that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [58]

Got it. And last one, can we return to the comments you made about home phone and how you're not emphasizing it anymore. That's a product with about a 90% profit margin. Why not keep it in the mix given that it's so profitable?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [59]

Yes, I would answer that two ways, Tim. One, it's not that we're taking it out of the mix, it's that we're taking a segmented basis to it

Two things to understand, and one of the reasons you'll see a two or three quarter adjustment phase is on the margin, the people who didn't have home phone when they came to us, and we sold them home phone because the triple-play packaging for the first six months made it almost in your interest to take home phone, and then they overwhelmingly disconnected at the end of six months, there wasn't a 90% margin. There wasn't any margin really at that particular point in time. So, it was an unhealthy part of the business

We're interested in selling home phone to people who want home phone. And we know that Generation X, consumers with kids, 87% of those customers have home phone and we want to be their home phone provider. We know that empty nest couples, 93% have a home phone. We know that empty nester singles, 81% have a home phone. Millennial with kids, even 75% have a home phone. So it's a segmented story of selling home phone

Millennial singles and couples, only 57% have a home phone today. So, for us to enter the marketplace choosing to try and force a university student who's moving away from home for the first time to take a triple-play bundle in his or her university dorm we don't think is in the long-term interest of our business. We think we should sell that customer more Internet

I understand that that sounds certainly counterintuitive with the approach we were taking in 2008. I hear in your comment you might think we're early in 2015 to start to take a much more segmented approach. We're confident that by 2017-2018 we're all going to be doing that

So, it really is just an approach to segmentation. And the impact, while it will show up in the subscriber numbers, it's not going to flow through the financials the way you think it is because of the way the six-month promotions have activated

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [60]

Thanks for that

The next question is from Greg MacDonald of Macquarie Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [62]

Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. A question is on the media division. I wonder if you might give us an update on the outlook for ad trends versus subscriptions

Actually if I could back track -- what were the ad trends versus subscription trends in the quarter relative to what we saw in the Q1 and Q4 periods? Was there any change this quarter? And with the ad outlook particularly is there anything changing in the second half in terms of your conversations with ad buyers? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rhonda Bashnick,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP of Finance   [63]

Sure. Q2 ad revenue story on a year-over-year perspective is actually a bit better than Q1, a little bit of the market coming back in Q2. Our Q2 revenue year over year was actually up a SNC, whereas we'd been down a bit in Q1. So, an improving trend from that point of view

And as we look out to the rest of the year, we actually hope we might see a little bit of that momentum continue but certainly are optimistic that we can stay flat on a year-over-year basis from a revenue point of view. And that's ad revenue

On the subscriber path, subscribers are sliding a teeny bit on us but actually, much as Jay said, we're not seeing a huge change there, certainly yet. And we are well protected in our penetration-based rate cards from a revenue point of view. So, again, feel confident we can be in a flat to slightly up mode for the remainder of the year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [64]

Okay, that's helpful, thanks. And can you remind me the show Me impact, that's an equity accounted business, is that not?

Rhonda Bashnick,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP of Finance   [65]

Yes, that's correct

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [66]

Okay. And so the impact on media margins is essentially operating leverage normal. There's nothing unusual going on there?

Rhonda Bashnick,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP of Finance   [67]

Correct

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [68]

Thanks very much, guys

Operator   [69]

The next question is from Maher Yaghi of Desjardins Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [70]

Yes, thank you for taking my question. I just want to go back to what you described as affecting your home phone subscriber metrics and you believe it's going to take only a couple of quarters to resolve itself

From what you described, it seems all the reasons you describe are generational issues. And other people describe them as wireless substitution. And these are trends that are just starting

So, why do you believe, from what you discussed, that these issues will get resolved in a quarter or two? Because it seems like more and more people are asking for these home phones to be disconnected?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [71]

Yes, I apologize if I didn't -- I probably didn't explain the thinking particularly clearly. What's interesting about this segment is, and our research has really told a clear message, that actually our customers who value home phone really value home phone. And, in fact, value it as high as Internet and higher than video, for the customers who value home phone

And the customers, the very small group of customers who have price sensitivity value on home phone, but if you gave it to them for the right price they value it. And then there's a rolling group of customers that you described that is generational that place almost no value on home phone

So the challenge with our packaging and how we've done it in the past is we did one size fits all and we tried to push everybody into the triple-play bundle. And as a result we were probably undercharging home phone in the bundle because customers who really valued it and saw it as an essential part of life were probably willing to pay more. And in order to get customers they started paying less

What I talked about in terms of the two or three quarters is we have a bucket of customers on the margin that are in a triple-play bundle and are going to turn off phone when they go to regular pricing because, in essence, we put them in a triple-play bundle in order to get the RGU. So the one-time impact is just to let that group flush through their six-month promotions

We don't disagree with you that there's also just a generational shift around voice but we don't think there's anything unique to Shaw in that generational shift. And we think home phone as a product, to the segments we talked about, and we shared some of the overwhelming numbers, for the segments we talked about, it's going to be viable for a long time

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [72]

Thanks for that clarification. Could you quantify what this sub group of subscribers would represent in total, that you believe are taking home phone but do not value the home phone product?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [73]

Taking home phone but won't choose to take it at full price, you're saying?

Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [74]

Exactly, yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [75]

I would suggest that we're going to be looking at home phone -- let me answer it this way. I am looking at Rhonda to see if I could answer this way. Directionally, I would suggest we're looking at home phone losses in the next couple quarters in the mid teens

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [76]

Okay, that's helpful, thank you. And then in terms of the CRTC impact on subscribers on video and Internet, I think it would be helpful if you can maybe help us in understand how much of it was on cable and how much of it is on Internet so that we can look at it going forward and compare a little bit your Internet trends

Because for us looking at your business, Internet is by far the most important subscriber group to follow because that's where the revenue is going to come in the future. And at this point it's hard to understand how much of the decline that we saw in the quarter was to the CRTC and how much of it is losses, competitive losses

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [77]

I understand where you're trying to go with the math. It's not a precise quarter. We don't think that it adds value to the disclosure to try and break through the best guesses on each of the various products. I understand where you're trying to go. I'm not sure we can help you get there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [78]

I think maybe to answer it differently, I think we talked a little bit about we didn't see a material uptick in cord cutting this quarter so that wasn't impacting our video subscriber trends. We continue to see positive growth on the Internet side

And then I think Jay talked and alluded to that definitely some weakness within the consumer home phone residential sector. But we're not going to give specific details but directionally, throughout the call we have given each individual components of the RGU base

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [79]

Okay, great. And just one last question. On the IP-TV offering, I don't want to steal your thunder when you announce it. It's quite exciting, I understand your position

However, I just wanted to understand, when you're going to be discussing this issue in the future quarters, is that going to come inside the rollout strategy or it's going to be an announcement of the technology deployment that will take a few quarters to be sold to clients. I'm just trying to understand what we're talking about here with the announcement you mentioned

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [80]

Yes, I don't think we can add much more to what we said previously. I don't think we can add much more to what we said previously

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [81]

Okay, that's fair. Thank you very much

The next question is from Rob Peters of Credit Suisse

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Peters,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [83]

Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Just two, quickly, on Show Me. I was just wondering, I think on the media segment you had about CAD3 million in revenues from transition with Show Me in the quarter, and I think you had about CAD5 million in Q1. Just wondering, do you expect that to continue over the back half of the year or now that Show Me is getting more ramped up we would expect those to drop off in the second half?

Rhonda Bashnick,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP of Finance   [84]

I think you'll continue to see probably in that lower range of closer to the CAD3 million on an ongoing basis. The CAD5 million included some one-time amounts for some programming that was sub-licensed to show Me so it's more the ad stuff will continue going forward, so the advertising will ramp down after we get out of the start up phase of it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Peters,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [85]

Perfect, thank you very much. And then in terms of the ramp on the impact on the income statement, I believe you had mentioned in the previous call that it was more front end loaded. Is that front end loaded in terms of 2015 or is that front end loaded as in it will be in there, we'll see a similar hit in the rest of the year and then in 2016 it will come down?

Rhonda Bashnick,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP of Finance   [86]

It is a start up so I think we are expecting to see it in that low double digits that we're picking up now for the next and coming quarters into 2016, as well, and then that will start to ramp down for the loss

 Rob Peters,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [87]

 Sanford Lee,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [89]

[flotus] recently introduced usage-based billing on their Internet product, basically as the rest of the industry. Do you plan on doing that any time soon?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [90]

We're certainly staying very close to it and following the changes that happen in the marketplace, doing lots, as we've talked about, segmentation and value testing with customers to see what makes the most sense. I wouldn't say that we have any immediate plans but we are staying very close to the trends in the marketplace

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sanford Lee,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [91]

Great, thanks. And the other question I had was on ViaWest. Your revenue and EBITDA growth expectations are low to mid teens. Can you say what the growth rates would be ex US dollar appreciation?

Rhonda Bashnick,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP of Finance   [92]

That is a US dollar forecast. We are, in terms of our forecasting, still trending to that low to mid teens, as a US forecasted company

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session

(Operator Instructions)
 The first question today comes from Jeff Fan of Scotiabank. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [2]

Thanks. Good afternoon, and congratulations to Peter on his retirement going forward

Couple of questions around the video. On the video losses, last year was around 12,000, this year is a bit higher than that. Wondering if you could just talk about the source of some of those losses

And then looking ahead to the X1 technical trial, just having seen some of their platform and then what it can do, there is a lot of work in the background to get X1 running. Just wondering if you can just share the type of investments that you've already made on the network and the infrastructure to ensure that you can get the X1 up and running, and have the kind of experience that your customer should get on that platform. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [3]

Great. Thanks, Jeff. I'll maybe start at a high level and Jay can add to it

I want to just step back. We used to be an engineering driven company that built stuff. We used to be the aggregator, and we're not that anymore

We're now a customer-centric organization, defined by customer experiences. And when you look at it, the internet has changed everything in this new world and we need scale. And so we're committed to getting scale through industry solutions that are partner led

And Comcast is an example of that this morning, and is a proof point of this strategy. And as we go forward, over the next year, you're going to see a variety of announcements from us that prove that this relationship is the right way and these relationships are the right direction for this Company

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [4]

I guess to build on your specific question, Jeff, it's Jay. On the Comcast technical trial, and where we're headed with this

We've done a tremendous amount of work on back office systems, on the ability to leverage the (inaudible) on understanding what's required in the network for the trial. And we share your view around the complexity of it, feel great confidence in the richness and depth and the relationship we had with Comcast. As we look at the complexity of this roll-out, it's hard to imagine for us that we could have done something like this on our own, like our first effort was in this area

So we don't underestimate the challenge. But we're really excited about the opportunity to create a differentiated video product that has many layers

In terms of your first question on video losses, we would say this about RGU losses generally. As we've alluded to, primarily the softness in our RGU losses has been created by the unbundling of our on-boarding, which as you saw is primarily impacting phone

But we used to -- the only way to get a promotional discount from Shaw was to take all three products. And we used to use our promotional discount to entice customers to take the products we want them to take. The shift that we undertook was to provide all of our customers the opportunity to get a six month promotion to whatever products they wanted to take from us, and to put them in the driver's seat

So that primarily drove the phone changes. There's a little bit of that in video, as well, as you can see. (Inaudible) only customer which we're certainly embracing

I would say beyond that primary piece, which is around how we're packaging our bundling. There's a series of other smaller factors that probably have impact on video and other subscribers. There was some movement in fiber to the home rural by our primary competitor

We've got some promotional activity from the primary competitor, probably the beginnings of some economic changes. So we've got three or four other relatively smaller things impacting it, but that would with our sense of RGUs generally

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [5]

Okay. And just follow on the investment on to support X1. Is it fair to say that you've given this some post ACF CapEx levels going forward that you stay within that? And do you feel comfortable that the investment to support X1 has been made, and that you can keep to that kind of CapEx level going forward and still get the product launched successfully?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [6]

Absolutely. We've announced the technical trial today. As you move forward through the various stages, we'll make other announcements

We can tell you this is very capital friendly. It's a very capital friendly program. And I would say two things to think about how the open road map would end up capital friendly as we work our way through the trial

One is, we've embraced the set-top box strategy of Comcast. And because we're launching only boxes that are the same as Comcast has in production, we've achieved up to just over 40% savings in our CP equipment going forward. Like for like experiences, and that's obviously capital friendly

And in addition to that, the technical trial and presumably the ultimate architecture will strongly leverage Comcast's video cloud. And therefore, not require us to duplicate that cloud in Canada

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [7]

Okay. Thanks very much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [8]

The next question comes from Bentley Cross of TD Securities. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bentley Cross,  TD Securities - Analyst   [9]

Just to follow on that last question. If it's capital friendly, is it going to be margin unfriendly? Or are there going to be recurring licenses associated with that X1?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [10]

Sure, it's Jay again. So I certainly wouldn't use those two words together

I think in general terms as you think about industry solutions partner led and this is one of a series of things you'll see us do over the next 18 months. I think it's fair to say that as you move to some software as a service and infrastructure as a service business models, which we believe is the future of the internet world, that there is some shift over time from CapEx to OpEx. I think that's fair to say

Boy, as we look at our 46% margin in the consumer division and everything that we're doing on Focus to Deliver, we're quite confident about our margin profile going forward. Not thinking that's going to move the needle dramatically

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bentley Cross,  TD Securities - Analyst   [11]

And then can you share any sort of timeline as to when this will actually be available, or are you keeping your cards close to the chest for now?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [12]

Your second point. Yes. No, we'll update you as we go forward here, but we can't do that right now

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bentley Cross,  TD Securities - Analyst   [13]

Okay. And then just lastly, a bit of a housekeeping question. The timing of rate increases kind of threw the street for a bit of a loop this year. Have you guys decided when you're going to put through rate increases this year?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [14]

Yes, for sure. It's Jay again

Catching everybody up, and we're talking -- most people are most interested in what we've historically called the cable side of the business within consumer. We have slightly different timing on satellite side and consumer and business side

We've historically done rate increases in the summer months, which aligns with when our costs go up in September. Both on most of our programming deals, and some of our staffing costs and other costs

Last year, as was well reported and seen in our results, we sort of moved that rate increase from September 1st to January 1st. We are returning to our summer rate increase period. We announced and put on our website new pricing June 1st, and have informed our customers that effective August 1st we're going to do our annual rate increase and come back to cycle

We've said to our customers as we've worked through this process, through our call centers and other things, that we're returning to a regular annual cycle that there will be no changes in rate over the 12 month period. And we've communicated packaging and so forth there

So that sets us up nicely really as you think about those changes to our base coming this summer and then the two phase changes, the TalkTV and some of the things that that makes possible. The pricing and packaging and margin in December

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bentley Cross,  TD Securities - Analyst   [15]

Great. That's all for me. Thank you very much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [16]

The next question comes from Glen Campbell of Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [17]

Yes, thanks very much. First, a clarification on your last answer, Jay

So did I hear correctly that there won't be an increase this September 1. It's a return to the original cycle, but you're going to use the repackaging to do increases in 2016?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [18]

Not really, no. What you heard is we're going to --

Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [19]

Sorry

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [20]

No, it's good. You're good. I mumble. What we're doing is a rate increase August 1st

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [21]

Okay

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [22]

We won't be doing one September 1st, because we're doing one on August 1st. And then there won't be another rate increase obviously for a 12 month period, and we've made that as part of our packaging for customers. So that change in general terms it's -- think about CAD2 on internet, CAD3 on TV, and those new rates are on our website today

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [23]

Perfect. That is very helpful. Thanks

And then just on the new X1 platform. When you look at what you can do product-wise relative to let's say the media room platform deployed by your competitor, what potential do you see for an edge?
 And our understanding of the platform is there are some elements of let's say the upgrade that are possible with the existing set-top box base, and some which would require new set-tops. I was wondering if you'd give us a bit of color on that, could you confirm that? And to the extent that it's true, how much of your existing set-top box base could take advantage?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [24]

The pause is thinking about how much information I can -- let me figure out how to come at it. Let's come at it this way. We're prepared to say this

If you look at the Microsoft media platform and the first generation of IPTV platforms, I think they've really took an approach much similar to the approach quite frankly of the write-down that we took today on our first attempt at IPTV. They took an approach of taking really the legacy approach to delivering video services, duplicated in the IP world. And so it was able to give you the flexibility of some internet-like functionality, but very much in a first generation

What the team at Comcast has done is totally embraced the complete integration of the internet into its customer experience, and that it's a very differentiated product from the first generation services. We also think the TV Everywhere elements of the product bring compelling advantages, and a similar experience to consumers. So we're quite excited about the technical trial, and the opportunity to move forward with Comcast

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [25]

Great. Thanks. On the existing set-tops, is there a portion of them that can, say, take advantage of a portion of the features?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [26]

There's a portion of them that will be able to take advantage of a portion of the features. But I'm going down a rabbit hole as I further answer these questions, so I think I'm going to have to leave it there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [27]

Fair enough. Maybe just one last one

So looking at the TV subscriber trajectory, it's a bit negative on the business side. Is that a structural trend, or do you think that going forward that negative becomes a positive?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [28]

Speaking plainly, we've seen -- they're not high ARPU customers, but we've seen a decrease of RGUs in Northern Alberta related to the oil sands activity. Very small ARPU, very small margin, because they've got sophisticated supply chain organizations. But that's what you're seeing in business video

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [29]

So longer term, stable or maybe up?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [30]

Longer term stable, maybe up. We'll see how new platforms affect our opportunity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst   [31]

Okay. Terrific. Thanks very much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [32]

The next question comes from Phillip Huang of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [33]

Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Just a quick follow-up on the consumer segment

For the TV subscribers, to what extent -- I know you mentioned that the biggest piece of it was due to the unbundling impact. But to what extent was the TV subscriber somewhat impacted by the economy in Alberta? And also historically, how have your customers responded to your price increases?
 I'm just wondering, given the price increase that you guys expect to put through on August 1st. Whether we should expect a corresponding potential increase in churn maybe of your lower end customers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [34]

Sure. We can say this. The stickiness of our rate increases has held over our past number of rate increases

To be fair, because of some of the packaging changes that we're making it's been a couple of years since we've done a TV increase. So we don't necessarily have the data points on that. Although we certainly believe and if you look hard at our personal TV package that now at CAD3, we offer very favorable value compared to what's available elsewhere in the marketplace

And remember, we've already repackaged on the video side. And I know Glen Campbell put out a great piece a couple months ago that shows you how our repackaging and what's done to video ARPU. So we think we have less exposure there

In terms of subscriber numbers, look, there's -- as we alluded to, there's clearly a number of things happening in the marketplace that are softening up things a little bit. And I think it's reasonable to say that economic conditions in Alberta are one of those things. I think it's possible to overstate that

And I also think it needs to be put in the context of, in the quarter, we had some pretty aggressive competitive promotional activity. We had some one-time kind of market share shift with the fiber to the home rural development of community that never had optic, and went directly to fiber to the home

So they're not increasing -- our primary competitor isn't increasing market share beyond what it is in the cities. But playing a little bit of catch-up because they had quite low penetration in some of those really smaller communities. So we've got a number of factors

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [35]

That's very helpful. Just maybe a bigger picture question. You guys have made a number of changes recently to make the overall business more efficient and with your call center and organizational structure

I hear you guys emphasize a lot on improving the scale of the business. If you step back and look at the assets that you own, do you see any more steps that you could take to maybe further optimize the scale of the business?
 For instance, if I look at the media industry, it seems to make a lot of sense for further consolidation where possible. Do you see any opportunities for optimization on that front?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [36]

Phil, it's Brad. We -- it's a dynamic and very fluid. We've always said we're very happy with the assets we have. We've gone through a lot of focus on the media side to remove costs, kind of address from a traditional media to focus more on the digital and where that's going and stuff

But, we feel we can continue to manage and grow the business. But you know the headwinds in there and the challenges, and we had a successful trip down in LA which was very good

And the ratings are good. You look at some of the performance this quarter of Shaw Media, is very strong. But that being said, you're always trying to see what the other guys are thinking and doing, and we like to take that approach

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [37]

Thanks. And final question. Just a housekeeping one

You guys mentioned in the MD&amp;A that there was some accelerated maintenance costs in the infrastructure services business. Could you maybe elaborate a little on what that was?

Unidentified Company Representative,  Shaw Communications Inc.   [38]

Yes. They planned expenses that just from a timing perspective in the third quarter, they are typically things related to our mechanical and electrical infrastructure. So across multiple regions, we ended up doing some simultaneous maintenance to the plant. So those were planned, just accelerated and one-time in the third quarter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [39]

Got it. Thanks so much

The next question comes from Drew McReynolds of RBC. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [42]

Thanks very much. Just two satellite questions if I can. I guess maybe for you, Brad

You talked about exploring opportunities here. Just with you now focusing on X1 going forward, just wondering how satellite fits in with the broader TV platform

Obviously with the business under a little pressure, is there a little bit more appetite to think about scaling that up with obviously your -- the other satellite operator here? And also just on the satellite sub front this quarter, just wondering a little bit better than we were looking for. Is there anything unusual in the quarter?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [43]

Jay answer the last one, and I'll talk about the first two. We love the business, we love the free cash flow that Shaw direct kicks off. You've seen this quarter how we've been able to continue to turn that business around with the right focus, with the right segmentation as we continue to go at the market

We still tend to have more of a rural base in there. And listen, when we think of the TV market and video market, we think of that somewhat trying to look at both on the cable side and the satellite side of how do we create value and what things we can do. And we think we have some good things on the come to be able to add value there

And we're just -- we're pleased because we think at the end of the day, what BCE wants to do and what we want to do I think are a little bit different. It always makes sense when you can look at those things to do that. But I think BCE feels that's very important to them, and it's a big driver and a big EBITDA contributor, I think, and certainly is the same for us

But I think we have a refocus on satellite. And you're seeing that results, and that's going to continue and we're pleased to have that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [44]

And filling in on the quarter, I think we've sort of flushed through some of the changes that we've made to the satellite business. And we're seeing some nice stability there, which we think will continue. Notwithstanding the obvious seasonal implications that you get in Q1 with cottages and stuff like that, that you're quite familiar with

We're quite happy with the performance of the asset in terms of the industry-leading customer satisfaction, and we think that's driving our results. We've done some great repackaging to really find the right spot in the video space, not all the way down to skinny basic, not all the way up to $90 video packages. And we're having success in that space, and I think the team is doing a tremendous job

You can't really see it in the results because we've confined the consumer division. But there have been many quarters where we were high mid-40%s on cable margin and low mid-30%s on satellite margin. If you look at the combined margin of the new consumer division delivering 46% margin, we're pretty proud of what the team has done in creating a new consumer organization to serve our customers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [45]

That's helpful. Thanks very much. Hopefully two quick follow-ups here. Just on the financial side, just wondering for FY15 if the CAD375 million in cash taxes is still the number to go with

And then just lastly, on free cash flow priorities. As we look out into FY16 and beyond, you're going to have some decent uptick in free cash flow, as well as your balance sheet looks certainly healthy these days. Just wondering if there's been any change or evolution on the free cash flow priority front? Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [46]

Yes. Hello, it's Peter here. I'll take that

In regards to the increase in tax rates and any impact on FY15, no material impact on our FCF guidance for the balance of the year. On an annualized run rate, the increases into FY16 will be about CAD10 million on a cash basis. So that's the first part of the question

In regards to as we look at FY16, I think we'll be in a better position as we complete our capital planning and our budgeting process here in October to come back with some guidance on FCF. But I agree overall with your sentiments for sure

The next question comes from Greg MacDonald of Macquarie. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [50]

Thanks, and let me add good luck to Peter in his retirement

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [51]

Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [52]

I wanted to ask you guys a quick question on business services. The metrics there were just a little softer in the 3Q relative to the 2Q. You mentioned I think, Brad, Northern Alberta. I wonder if there's maybe a little more softness in the economy there

Can you talk a little about the economy? It's been a while since we've gotten an update there, sometimes there's a lag effect to what goes on in terms of the commodity. And then the follow-on there with business, with the business impact, if you could talk a little about that I think it would be helpful for all of us

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [53]

Sure. Well, I'll certainly talk about it with the business space which I think is your original question, and we'll let folks jump in if there are other comments more generally

So we had a shift in approach with business network services and made a leadership change in early January, on the fourth of January. And appointed Ron McKenzie to lead our business network services team. We really just weren't living into the potential of the opportunity, as you could see in the numbers

A number of things have happened in the first six months of the job, and we're delighted with the progress that we've made so far. Ron's built a new organization in Shaw business. It did feel like we're trying to run through the mud, and we've got momentum with a high powered, high energy, crisp organization

It's a big organizational change of Ron's eight direct reports, only one of them reported to his predecessor previously. Completing the sales structure, working on new sales plans, and new strategy

So you see a number of expenses in the current quarter that are related to that strategy. A few million dollars of actual strategy work with our strategy consultants to really do a deep dive, and make sure that we get it right this time

And what's exciting for us is the funnel is coming together nicely. And so we had a record sales month in May, and think it may be a one month record. I think we might beat it again in June, we've certainly we've got a shot at it

So as that funnel flows through FY16, I think you're going to see us live into the potential of the business on the revenue side. Clearly, the analysis has shown us that we're under-indexed in sales resources compared to Cox and Comcast and some of the organizations that have really stepped into this opportunity

So I think if you look at next fiscal year, you're going to see revenue gains better than you've seen is certainly the goal so far. You'll see EBITDA growth, but it won't be at the same pace as revenue for a few more quarters as we invest our way into the business space

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [54]

Okay. That's very helpful. Anything on the economy overall? Can I assume, therefore, there wasn't necessarily more of a negative impact this quarter?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [55]

This is Brad, Greg. I think there's no doubt I think there's some softness there. And it might be a little early

We stay close to it, but I think you can look at in the results of the new builds area, I think was up 16% year-over-year. But we're going to continue to stay close to it. And as Jay mentioned a little earlier, we had some low margin camps up in Northern Alberta, had some impact, but we're not seeing it, but it may be a little early

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [56]

Thanks. And then a quick follow-up on ViaWest. Maybe just a quick comment on the pipeline outlook there

And then with respect to guidance, it looks like you need to get a pretty nice step-up in the 4Q to hit that guidance number. You didn't change it. So can we assume therefore that something is happening in the 4Q, either seasonal bump-up or expectation of customers coming on?

Nancy Philllips,  ViaWest - Co-founder &amp; CEO   [57]

Yes, no, we continue to see very strong demand for the portfolio of services and products that we have in the market. Outsourcing in the US remains top of mind, especially as we see it in the security compliance and kind of big data demand factors. So we are seeing an expanding pipeline, good growth

We have seen some additional complexity, some sort of almost sort of point in time deals that probably extended our sales cycle a little bit. We don't see that as a continuing trend, more of just the opportunities that we've been presented in our regions. We will be converting those opportunities

So we do continue to support, obviously, that low to midterm, long term -- low to midterm growth strategy on the long term. So we see continued health in the business, and strong demand for our capabilities in the regions that we represent

Particularly pleased with our recent announcement around the security asset that we picked up. That applied trust to opportunity we think, again, fits nicely in our portfolio. And we're seeing very strong demand dynamics and pull-through opportunities with that existing base of customers as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [58]

Okay. And anything unique in the margin that -- I'm just looking at that guidance number thinking it's a bit of a bump-up expectation in the 4Q. Is that something we should expect? Is there something unique in that?

Nancy Philllips,  ViaWest - Co-founder &amp; CEO   [59]

No, I think we feel good about obviously in terms of meeting that low to mid-teens requirement on the -- our guidance on the growth side of the business. Q3, we did have some one-time expenses

Number one, as I mentioned, on the acceleration on some maintenance expense. But we did see on top of that some additional business development expense related to, as we've mentioned we've been looking in the market and spending some time working on our next greenfield opportunities

So those were some one-time expenses that hit us. And then we saw a little bit of the contribution on the Canadian expenses starting to come in in third quarter as well. So those three things contributed to third quarter, most of them being one-time expenses

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [60]

Okay. Thanks. That's helpful

Operator   [61]

The next question is from Maher Yaghi of Desjardins Capital Markets. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Capital Markets - Analyst   [62]

Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask you just a follow-up on the X1 platform you're going to be trying out. Is that for the XI3 or the hybrid system or, sorry, the XI3, the IP platform or the XG1 which is the hybrid?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [63]

I think it's fair to say that we are trialing in the technical trial all elements of the Comcast X1 platform. And that includes those elements that are in production today and test (inaudible) in the future. So I think you can look at the partnership as a rich and deep partnership, and the trial as a broad one

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Capital Markets - Analyst   [64]

That drives into basically the question I had on my mind, which is you were trying to develop an all IPTV platform, trying to unplug your system from the Qwan Technology. Now through transitioning to a hybrid system, you're still going to have to work with the Qwan hybrid system

How long do you believe you're going to be on that platform until you become an all IP? Because your competitors are launching a gigabit ethernet internet and [SDTH] across multiple areas in Western Canada. So in terms of your competitiveness on internet, how do you see Shaw is positioned in the short -- in the medium term, let's say?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [65]

Maybe we'll take your direct question which is about competitiveness on the internet, because I didn't necessarily follow all of the pieces going into that. But let's deal with that directly. For sure, we're like others in the cable industry, we're committed to delivering the next generation internet performance, and you've seen our investments in DOCSIS 3.0

You've seen our investments in CCAP. You'll see our investment in DOCSIS 3.1. You'll see our investments in fiber

We think we actually are well positioned to be able to compete on a very cost effective basis in terms of the next generation internet services. And that's the guts of our business, so all of our strategy is in terms of that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Capital Markets - Analyst   [66]

Okay. So in terms of internet connections on the business side, what drove the decline you believe? You talked about some weakness in the economy in Northern Alberta. Is that the main reason why internet net additions on business was weaker than last year, or was there some key or let's say contract losses?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [67]

No, there weren't key contract losses. It's going to become harder and harder to link RGUs on the business side of the business as a predictor of future revenues. We'll look at how we -- and it's certainly still accurate today

And to be clear, the Northern Alberta losses are not big numbers. They're at low rates and low margin, so they don't really have a significant financial impact but they certainly have a subscriber impact. As we go forward, though, where we're quite bullish on the revenue growth opportunity in business, we're not convinced that it will be reflected in growth of our legacy RGUs

If you look at the way we deploy internet connectivity, if you look at the way we deploy next generation voice and all of our cloud based IP services, which are the center of our small and medium sized business growth. Those deployments don't necessarily drive RGUs. They drive monthly recurring revenue

And so will there be some pull-through because of the momentum and the number of salespeople and the opportunity? Will there be some pull-through on our legacy RGU delivered numbers in business? There may well be, but really, that depends on the mix that consumers choose

So the concept that we're necessarily installing an internet modem in a traditional sense as the mechanism to deliver internet is not in many instances the way we're doing it. And certainly the concept that we're putting in an individual digital phone terminal in order to feed voice is not necessarily the way the next generation of services get deployed. It will be a little harder seeing the RGU business connection directly to revenue going forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Capital Markets - Analyst   [68]

Okay. Thank you very much

The next question comes from Rob Peters of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Peters,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [70]

Hello. Thanks for taking my questions. Just briefly on ViaWest, I was wondering if you could give us an update on the progression on the Oregon data center? I know it's supposed to be completed over the summer

Is there any chance we're going to see any revenues from that in 2015? Or is that all primarily in 2016?

Nancy Philllips,  ViaWest - Co-founder &amp; CEO   [71]

Yes, it actually opens late July. We're on track to have that commissioned. And we're in the process as we speak

So that is on time, and we have pre-sold quite a few customers. So they will start to install starting in the August time frame. So we've been very successful probably six to eight months out in terms of our pre-selling opportunities for that, with several customers that are ready for installation post commencement

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Peters,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [72]

Perfect. Thank you very much. And maybe just going back to when the transaction was originally done, I'm not sure if this has been answered. But with the Spectrum auction or option with Rogers, will there be any tax implications on the CAD100 million payment now that that's completed?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; CFO   [73]

Yes, it's Vito here. Yes, we will have a gain on that transaction, and there will of course be tax associated with that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Peters,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [74]

 Vince Valentini, TD Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [2]

Thanks very much. First off, Vito or somebody else, is it possible to quantify at all, those one-time employee and Calgary start-up costs within ViaWest in the fourth quarter?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc  - EVP &amp; CFO   [3]

Hi, Vince, it's Vito here. Maybe I'll take it and then ask Nancy to provide some commentary on the business

In the quarter, I'll say we had about CAD3 billion to CAD4 billion of one-time related type expenditures. Which, when you look at it on an absolute basis on a percentage basis, it sort of distorts what really the success and the momentum that we're seeing in the business

Just by way of reference in US dollars, our Q4, both revenue and EBITDA performance, improved 4% versus the prior quarter. So, we're really, really happy on the US dollars. A little bit of noise when you bring that back into Canadian dollars in some of the consolidation type entries. Nancy, I'll ask you to give a little color on that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nancy Phillips,  Shaw Communications Inc  - Co-Founder &amp; CEO of ViaWest   [4]

As Vito said, it's a one-time impact to the business a little bit. There is some start-up costs, obviously, as we start to bring on the Calgary asset. But this was primarily driven by some long-term incentive impact

But, listen, fourth quarter, we're very, very pleased with how our fourth quarter came in. We saw our strongest bookings quarter of the year, and quite frankly, in the history of the Company. The demand for our products and services remains very, very high

We saw our Oregon site come online in July and had unprecedented early-stage customers coming in to that facility. We think it's on track to break even in half the time of our typical modeling that we've seen in historical data centers

Our margins have remained very consistent with historical standards. And the fourth quarter really put us in a position to do some small acceleration capital because of the growth we're seeing in early, early demand in the first quarter of this year

Fourth quarter for ViaWest, actually, was very, very strong. We had a little bit of a slow start but as we finished the year the demands remained strong and high and feel very good going into 2016

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [5]

Great, thanks. One other question on if the guidance for 2016 -- maybe Vito again -- can you explain a bit the difference between the bottom and the low end of the range that, if I read you correctly, is 0% to 3% EBITDA growth is what you're signaling

To get to the low end of that range is there some uncertainty that you guys might have about how much demand and uptick there'll be from customers for the X1 platform, given it's a bit of different economics than what you've had in the past when you'll have OpEx versus CapEx, so you may be hedging your bets a little bit in case there's huge demand for that?
 It may be a nice problem to have but it may cause your EBITDA growth to suffer temporarily. Is that part of the reason why you may have some caution at the low of the range only expecting flat?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc  - EVP &amp; CFO   [6]

Vince, I'll start and maybe, Jay, you can pick it up here. Definitely at the end of the day I'd believe we would be disappointed with FY16 ending up flat on the low end of the range. There's lots of balls in the air and you described a couple of them

And including, obviously, economic activity in Alberta. We've got the NGV costs that you were describing and the integration of that into the system and probably more back-ended as far as really impact on RGUs. Jay, any additional color you want to provide?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP &amp; COO   [7]

Just to reaffirm where you're headed, Vito. That's certainly not -- the low end of the range is certainly not how we're managing the business. There's a lot going on in this fiscal year and most of it is good. But there's a lot of moving pieces, so we've probably gone with a bit of a broader range than in past years

If you're trying to rework the math, there's not a lot of risk in the X1 number. Similar to our previous comments on this, we don't really see it degradating margins. We think there is a little shift from CapEx to OpEx. We see this as a business that we are going to make money on and not do harm to the margin

One thing you might not see as clearly in our numbers is, for sure, we've got some pressure on content costs. It's certainly one of our key initiatives this year, to try and change that relationship. It's pretty clear there is a relationship between video revenue and content costs. It's clearly asymmetrical, today. I think we'd like to add some symmetry to that relationship

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [8]

Great, thanks, Jay --

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc  - EVP &amp; CFO   [9]

Sorry, Vince. The only other item I'd add is promotional activity. We saw some aggressive competitive activity in June and we let it go by the wayside. I think as we move into FY16 we need to obviously protect our business as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [10]

Phillip Huang, Barclays Capital

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [11]

Thanks, good afternoon. A quick question on the guidance as well. It seems like you're -- so your guidance implies low single-digit from cash flow growth for FY16. Should we assume that dividend growth will also be consistent with free cash flow growth? Does that imply dividend growth will slow from the high single-digits that we saw this year to low single-digits in FY16?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc  - EVP &amp; CFO   [12]

It's Vito here again. I think it's too early to make any extrapolations on dividend related to our FCF guidance. There's a lot of things moving through. As you look at FCF, I will guide more directly to cash taxes and just for modeling purposes you should use very similar level to our FY15 of CAD375 million

There's obviously pension-related contributions that move around during the course of the year as we look at interest rates in some of the more macro asset performance. That's a variable that we need to obviously take into account

But, as it relates to dividend, we usually give guidance on dividend and make it in the January timeframe. We're very, very confident in our long-term prospects and the strategies that were undertaken and feel very, very -- from a dividend perspective -- obviously very comfortable with where we're at

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [13]

Got it. A quick follow-up on the operating environment, particularly as it relates to Alberta. We certainly believe that telecom revenues are quite recession-proof. As you mentioned, it was a factor in the accelerated subscriber decline

I was wondering if you could give us some color on the flow-through of your August 1 price increase versus (technical difficulty) price increases. Have you guys observed any resistance to the price increase, whether it's in terms of increased court shaving or churn? Just wondering how does the current environment compare with the prior cycles in 2009? Do you think the [misco] court shaving is potentially higher given the prevalence of over-the-top today?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP &amp; COO   [14]

Thank, Phillip, it's Jay. I guess there's a couple elements of that. Certainly, in terms of the Alberta environment, we have seen a disproportionate impact on RGU results in Alberta compared with the other markets that we serve. Certainly if you go back to the first half of FY14, there actually really weren't material RGU losses in Alberta. The strength of the economy was really driving our results and so we've seen a shift in that and certainly disproportionate

We ran into some incredibly aggressive activity in June, competitively, which subsided in July and has returned to the normal intense competition that we face in Western Canada. There was an overlap with that timing over the notification of our rate increase. For sure, for customers who were absolutely price sensitive and looking for options, we have a little bit of a perfect storm there in June

In general terms, we've seen the rate increase pass through similar to previous rate increases. We did make some commitments to our customers. What happened, of course, is we moved the September rate increase for a variety of reasons and we went back to our normal summer rate increase. We've communicated to our customers that we'll be adjusting rates only on an annual basis in the summertime. So you'll see that normalize out as we move forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [15]

Right, okay. Just to clarify, then in terms of the competitive activity that you guys saw in the summer, that has since fully subsided? Or did it resurge into the back-to-school timeframe, as well? Did it fully subside at this point?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP &amp; COO   [16]

It fully subsided and July and August we had good months, given the seasonality of -- July's got a little bit of negative seasonality of it, but year over year we're in good shape. So far in Q1, we're back to just the most competitive environment in North America. We're not on that really deep one-year price discount on all products

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [17]

Got it. Thank you so much

Jeff Fan, Scotia Bank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [19]

Thanks and good afternoon, everyone. Couple of questions, more on the core cable business. When we look at your results, a lot of it is currently being driven by rate increases. But it sounds like you do obviously have a number of product and service enhancements coming with X1s being one, and it sounded like there's more on the broadband side

Can you help walk us through some of these product enhancements? I know timing may be sensitive. Can you give us a feel that over the next 12 or 18 months, that these service enhancements on the product will support these rate increases? So that if your competitors come out with new service enhancements, that you're able to compete effectively? Maybe just talk a little bit more about that

And then the second part of the question is more related to 2016. A lot of BDUs are now looking at how they're going to repackage some of their television channels, preparing for skinny basic and pick packs. Your competitor, main competitor, Talus, is already very flexible in how they package their television services

Wondering what you're thinking is going into next year how some of your channel packagings may or may not change. Wondering if you can talk a little bit about that as well? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP &amp; COO   [20]

Jeff, Jay again. Sure, lots of folks have issued press releases about things that are going to happen in FY16 and 2017 and beyond. I think we're very -- as Brad said, we're very aligned with where the industry is headed and the cable advantage on broadband and DOCSIS 3.1

My sense of it is that you'll see us announce product launches when we launch products, which is more of Shaw's approach to the marketplace as opposed to shadowing that. And that those product launches combined with the X1 platform, will give us a very active next 12 months

What's exciting about it is we'll be bringing meaningful new differentiated products to market, really, each quarter. Both of those streams have got stages that we step into the marketplace with some really compelling offerings. We are going to be very active in the consumer cable business

In terms of your comments on television channels and packaging for Let's Talk TV, it's fair to say that all of us in Western Canada have offered a greater level of choice for a long time. So we've seen customers repackage. You'll see some changes in March from us to impact the size of our packaging to make sure that we're staying in touch with where we're headed, here

Also, the skinny basic. I don't think there's anything scary in that. I think the team's done a terrific job of building an elegant package that fits beautifully with our current packaging and provides choice for consumers

And then you'll see us as we go throughout the calendar year moving to the full Pick and Pay environment, as you can appreciate. To my comments on symmetrical versus asymmetrical content cost, negotiations with the broadcasters are not simple and so we're working our way through that through the calendar year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [21]

Just as a quick follow-up, is your comment regarding content costs, did you talk on that from the BDU of the business? I guess flipping that onto the media side, how does that impact maybe Barb's business, when we think about content cost or content revenue on that side of the business?

Barb Williams,  Shaw Communications Inc  - EVP &amp; President of Shaw Media   [22]

Hi, it's Barb. I think from our side of the business we obviously have a handful of very significant deals with our various carriers which are at various stages of their terms. As those deals come up for renegotiation, in our Let's Talk TV environment as we face different packaging options, we'll be looking to be negotiating rates for our first stand-alone as well as small packages as well as larger bundles

It certainly does change the environment of the negotiation a bit. We work hard to keep the cost side of content, from our point of view, down as low as possible and provide good value to, ultimately, to our providers and on through to our customers. But it is a changing environment and it's still to be worked out as FY16 and FY17 happen

 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [25]

Thanks very much. My questions are on Shaw Media, for you, Barb, following up on the last question. In general, you talk about in your MD&amp;A, next generation ad solutions for Media. Just wondering if that has to do with addressable advertising. Even if it doesn't, can you speak to where we are at Shaw in terms of bringing addressable advertising onto the TV platform?
 Secondly, in terms of the tracking for Q1, obviously a seasonally stronger quarter than Q4, just wondering if you could talk to those top-line trends. Lastly, on the margin front for media, I know Q4 is a seasonally weaker quarter. Just wondering some of the cost efficiencies and reworking that you did last quarter, is some of that year-over-margin improvement sustainable on a go-forward basis?

Barb Williams,  Shaw Communications Inc  - EVP &amp; President of Shaw Media   [26]

Sure, all good questions. From the next generation advertising perspective, we do believe in Media that the answer, here, is to be smarter about using more data more effectively to help advertisers be smarter about reaching the audience that they're interested in reaching. So we do see the power of television in the future being closely aligned with the intelligence of data

We are working both independently to understand how to move those projects forward, as well as working cooperatively with the CRTC's working group. Because we do believe, ultimately, there's an industry solution here that can continue to make television a very powerful opportunity for advertisers

Yes, there's efforts in that front and we believe that there can be real strong opportunity on the addressable front, as well as putting advertising onto some of the other platforms where audiences are enjoying our content today, like the VOD platform. Some good momentum there that we're keen about

To your other questions, I think the restructure in April absolutely helped to get us on a better path both in terms of cost base that makes sense to a business that's at the mature stage that ours is. As well as organizing the business to be more future-oriented so that we are expanding the skill base around the products that will move us beyond just being a pure broadcast company, but help us to define product for other platforms of other lengths to work with advertisers in other ways in branded content, et cetera

I do believe that we have made an important shift in our opportunity to keep a strong margin in the business with the restructure that we went through. We saw nice results in Q4 that the team's really pleased with, which were in large part about cost control, and that does reflect the restructure that we did

Finally, to your other question about Q1, it is an important quarter to us. We're very, very focused on it. The election money has helped support the quarter. We're seeing some upside in that. So far the quarter is looking not too bad, actually. We're feeling pretty good

 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [27]

Tim Casey, BMO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [29]

Thanks. A couple things, maybe it's for Jay. Can you talk a little bit about some of the dynamics you're seeing in the subscriber trends? I know you've articulated a focus on broadband, but on a net basis the RGU impact on the quarter seemed a bit negative

Then on ViaWest, you made comments that you were very pleased with the fourth quarter. But I thought I heard you say on an organic basis it grew at 4%. That seems to be below the average growth rate. Just wondering if you're expecting a significant acceleration from that trend?
 Could you also speak to the free cash flow profile of ViaWest? When we just do a very simple analysis of EBITDA trends versus the articulation of the capital your spending there, do you expect this business to achieve positive free cash flow anytime soon?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc  - EVP &amp; CFO   [30]

It's Vito here. I'll ask Trevor also, and Nancy, to chime in on ViaWest as well. On the 4%, let me just make that clear, that was Q4 over Q3 momentum. That extrapolates to something much more significant, double-digit. That's not quarter over quarter, that's Q4 over Q3, on that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc  - SVP of Corporate Development &amp; Capital Markets   [31]

Yes, Tim, it's Trevor. On the CapEx related to the business, we've always -- I think Nancy articulated -- just the growth in the demand that we're seeing in the US environment, and we did open up a new facility and it's doing extremely well. We really look at a lot of that as success-based capital and it's great capital to spend and a high return on that capital. In the near-term we've always said we're going to invest in our growth businesses and we certainly see this as a very attractive growth business for us in the US

In Q4 you saw capital higher in business infrastructure service, but a lot of the capital, again, was related to the first data center in the Canadian portfolio and that was roughly CAD24 million in Q4. So, just echoing Nancy's comments, this is exactly why we made the investment just over a year ago and really happy with the way things are performing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nancy Phillips,  Shaw Communications Inc  - Co-Founder &amp; CEO of ViaWest   [32]

Listen, the fundamentals of the business remain extraordinarily strong. The demand in the market is only increasing. We were very pleased with the acquisition of Applied Trust in July. Adding a whole security portfolio of services into our business is only adding additional value to our customers

So I would echo. These are the growth business. And the capital for high demand services and products that we are building is really what the focus of the organization is at this point

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc  - SVP of Corporate Development &amp; Capital Markets   [33]

We've always portrayed it as if the maintenance capital within the business is roughly 3% of sales. So if we elected to, we could turn this into an additive component of our free cash flow profile. But again, we don't think the time is right to do that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nancy Phillips,  Shaw Communications Inc  - Co-Founder &amp; CEO of ViaWest   [34]

I think one of the differentiators of ViaWest, clearly I think we actually -- I believe we're one of the leading companies in terms of capital efficiency because of the way we build the centers. We tend to augment over a period of time based on the capacity arising

So as customers start to install and we see power and cooling requirements change over time, that's when we start to add additional capital into the existing center. Not only did it continue growth opportunity but clearly, I think we're actually one of the best in the business in terms of the way we build it on a success-based profile

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc  - EVP &amp; CFO   [35]

Tim, it's Vito here. Maybe before we flip it back to Jay to address the first part of your question, give me the opportunity to address a couple of other little things. First of all, when you look at FY16 capital versus FY15, although it doesn't come through on our free cash flow as we define it, obviously, FY15 represented the last year of our accelerated capital fund. We'll see those dollars flow through, as well as far as FY16 from where we currently stand

As we move into FY17 we pick up another CAD60 million or so related to the cash taxes. And that's the impact, everything else being equal, of the FY16 representing the final year of our tax deferral pick-up. So some nice momentum on SCF as we move forward here

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP &amp; COO   [36]

Great. And Tim, you asked for some color -- it's Jay -- on the subscriber trend. I would say a couple of things to give you a sense of how we're thinking about this

The Q4 results were driven by a very significant spike in competitive losses in June that was driven by deep discounting from our primary competitor. We've seen a return to more rational pricing environment. Certainly the subscriber results trajectory from Q4 is not acceptable and is not the way to think about our business going forward. We see a material improvement in consumer RGUs in FY16 over FY15

A couple other things I would say to your comment. One is we talked before about the bundle change in promotional packaging and the impact on phone. You'll see that the impact of the bundle change lessen in Q1 and then Q2 phone RGUs will be a organic representative RGU number. So that's just the timing on that

In terms of competitive responses that we talked to in our response to Jeff, I think our very active plans this year give us a number of levers, both in terms of the X1 platform and broadband that will allow us to not only respond if there's a repeat of this competitive activity and even play a little bit of offense. And then my final point on broadband subs is to reconnect everybody with the nature of the competitive environment in Alberta and BC

Our primary competitor links internet and video together into bigger contracts and pulls both. If you look at our results over the last number of quarters, (technical difficulty) gap between video performance in terms of net gain and internet performance, you'll see the gap of that is quite similar. It's the pull-through that pulls down internet

The way to think about that is we've always been very successful with millennials. We're very successful on the internet-only base. That's the trend that you're seeing on the internet side. As we stabilize video subs, you'll be able to start to see the gains in broadband start again

Greg MacDonald, Macquarie

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [38]

Guys, I want to go over CapEx just a little bit more. I hate to flog a dead horse but it's an important horse. In the past you've indicated that capital intensity, base case capital intensity on the cable side, is around 20% of revenues. I'm wondering if that's still the case and whether, in the guidance for 2016, there's any growth CapEx still in that? Or whether that unusual growth CapEx is already completed

Then, Trevor or Vito, whoever wants to address it, a good way of giving us better insight on what the ViaWest CapEx profile and help us get what the free cash profile is on that business. Really good growth, and I'm not going to debate whether spending CapEx on double-digit growth is valid. I think it very much is

But what would help us to understand is when you get a somewhat mature revenue and EBITDA line, let's call it high single-digits, is it safe to say that CapEx profile is going to be somewhere in the 10% to 15% or 10% of sales range? That would help us look into 2017 and 2018 and try and do some numbers based on the growth profile then. Any insights on that would be helpful

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc  - EVP &amp; CFO   [39]

Let me address second part. Then maybe, Jay, you can pick up the consumer piece of it. And Trevor, I invite you as well

I think what you're asking for there is a very good suggestion as we move forward, maybe splitting a little bit of our capital profile for ViaWest became growth and, I'll call it, maintenance or whatever existing. That's something that I think we'll put our best foot forward on and give you some color to that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc  - SVP of Corporate Development &amp; Capital Markets   [40]

Maybe we'll take that away, as well, about providing a bit more granularity on the US versus the Canadian businesses. We are very excited about the growth within the US business. But I don't want to give the impression that it's going to be a 10% or 15% capital intensity business in 2017 or 2018. We still see tremendous growth within the business and the dynamics in the US, specifically

We'll probably continue to -- if you back out the impact of FX -- continue to invest capital that approximates the US business EBITDA, as long as the return on that capital is still there as we look at new greenfield builds. This year we've got a plan to build another new data center and ViaWest has a history of doing one to two new greenfields a year. And I think that'll continue, as we really like the industry dynamics

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [41]

Okay, but to the point, guys, it's very difficult for us. It's 46% of sales in CapEx this year in ViaWest. In a year where, to be quite blunt, I think the free cash was a bit of a surprise to the low end to a lot of analysts

So we're having a difficult time understanding -- we're prepared to say great, ROI is high. I'm happy for you to spend that CapEx. But we're having a tough time understanding what that means for 2017 and 2018. Unfortunately markets look at one to two years out

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc  - EVP &amp; CFO   [42]

Point noted. We'll take it away and see what we can do going forward. Just to Trevor's point, we're very bullish on this business going forward and I think we're going to stop just shy of committing to what that profile looks like in 2017 and 2018. But if we can give you additional color to help you understand what a full at-capacity return is versus the growth, then I think that allows you to get may be as excited as we are about the business

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc  - SVP of Corporate Development &amp; Capital Markets   [43]

I'll go back to when we initially announced the transaction, we always positioned it, and maybe it was a bit unclear, on an unlevered basis. It was going to be free cash flow plus or minus 10%. I think that's still the same message. And when I say unlevered, it's really EBITDA less CapEx, and we're still comfortable with that going forward, I would say

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [44]

Got it. On the cable side, guys, is that a 20% business now?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc  - EVP &amp; CFO   [45]

Yes. The way we've talked about it for the last number of years is about Canadian CapEx. We're not talking about business infrastructure, we're talking about Shaw Business and Consumer and Media. We've talked about that in the CAD850 million range and we've guided to that again

I think that's a great number for this year that's allowing us to invest in what we need to invest. Note that there's been a significant degradation in FX exposure to CapEx and we've been able to absorb that within the CAD850 million run rate. So we're getting even more bang for our buck, which is the great thing about DOCSIS 3.1 and CCAP and all of the tremendous things that are happening on the technology side

I don't know that we're really in a position, with so many moving pieces, to give multi-year capital guidance except to say the cable industry in general has an enormous cost advantage on the capital side, compared to our primary competitors. So we'll sort out the timing on how we exploit that

Maher Yaghi, Desjardins Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [48]

Yes, thank you for taking my questions. I have two questions. The first is on capital allocation and the second one is on home phone

On the capital allocation side, I wanted to ask you, you have relatively low debt levels compared to other companies. I wanted to see how do you feel in relation to how you've deployed your capital so far and if there are ways you believe to improve the capital allocation ratios by either doing other acquisitions or potential buybacks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc  - EVP &amp; CFO   [49]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [50]

The second question -- sorry. I had a second question I wanted to ask you, this morning the CRTC said that there are more Canadians who subscribe exclusively to mobile than to wired phones. We've seen cable companies in the US, like Comcast, join with Verizon, for example, to offer a combined product offering, triple play, quadruple play, to continue to be successful in the marketplace

How do you view your product offering? And is there ways to improve it by offering mobile services somehow, through partnerships with other companies?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc  - EVP &amp; CFO   [51]

Meyer, it's Vito. Trevor and I will address your first part of the question perhaps. And then Jay, you can get the second one. In regards to capital allocation, of course we're committed to investment grade. We're currently sitting in the 2.2 net debt-to-EBITDA range and we guide to 2 to 2.5 around that

I'd say we start at that point and then we determine, obviously, how much money we have available within that. Investment in the business is our primary focus and we're happy to stretch that investment where it's the right thing for our long-term interests and good for our shareholders, all with the envelope of obviously maintaining an investment grade

I think when we talk about share buybacks and share issuances under the drip or whatnot, those are all, I'll call them quarter-to-quarter type decisions and things that can move around a little bit. But I wouldn't expect any material departure from what you've seen from us for the last two years

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc  - SVP of Corporate Development &amp; Capital Markets   [52]

I'm just glad that capital allocation priority is the key for us as a management team. And you'll see us -- that's why we are investing in our growth businesses, where we see strong return like business network services. You heard Brad mention both the exciting product launches that we announced this quarter. Jay's mentioned DOCSIS 3.1. And we've talked a lot about the capital that we are investing in our ViaWest business as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [53]

Great

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP &amp; COO   [54]

Then I'll take the home phone voice question from you. We're in Denver this week and we're in board meetings all day today, so I didn't see the CRTC stats. I won't specifically refer to them. Obviously understand that Comcast-Verizon announcement

I think it's fair to say if you look at our product road map and where we're headed as a Company, that while we are most bullish on broadband and video, that we think there are opportunities in voice and that we're exploring industry developments and other developments along with our Wi-Fi strategy, and things that we're doing on the Shaw Business side and figuring out what the appropriate go-to-market is to re-energize an IP voice product. So, we share your view that there's opportunities in that space for Shaw

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [55]

Just a follow-up on that. Maybe you can -- is your Wi-Fi coverage broad enough to launch something like some of the cable companies in the US where they launched their own exclusive Wi-Fi wireless network? So far it hasn't worked great, but is that the way you're thinking? Or more offering a combined Wi-Fi plus full wireless offering?
 Because, as I mentioned, the CRTC said that 20% of Canadians have exclusively relying on wireless this year versus 14% on the landline phones. You need to participate in that broad direction to be able to compete in the marketplace

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP &amp; COO   [56]

Yes. I don't disagree with some of your comments. We do have an exceptional Wi-Fi network and we're building elements on top of that in terms of our next products and services, which I think make it quite exciting

We think there's -- we don't think you can look at this business through the lens of the legacy products and services. We think you need to look at the business through the lens of cloud-based services and next-generation IT services. I really can't go further than that without signaling something that we're not in a position to signal

 Robert Peters,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [59]

Hi, thank you for taking my question. Touching earlier on your comment around the plus to minus 10 on the simple free cash flow for ViaWest, looking at the guidance for next year, that implies some healthy growth in that section of the business, which I think has been consistent with your commentary. I was wondering if you could give us an idea of how much of that growth is driven from the new facilities that have been opened up this fall versus any future plans or growth that exists in facilities?

Nancy Phillips,  Shaw Communications Inc  - Co-Founder &amp; CEO of ViaWest   [60]

We are in the process of -- let's see, we just opened in July the Oregon facility. We've seem, obviously, the strongest bookings pre-commissioning of that facility. Obviously very good demand in the very first couple of months of the quarter

It will be, obviously, a positive in terms of how we look at our 2016 and beyond. We see continued strong demand within the existing facility. Within the approximately CAD100 million of US capital that's being spent this year, we are building a new data center in Dallas

And we're augmenting additional -- our existing footprint of data centers, as we see continued growth. That's largely where that capital is allocated to in the 2016 forecast

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc  - EVP &amp; CFO   [61]

The capital guidance that we gave for business infrastructure services is basically all in the US

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nancy Phillips,  Shaw Communications Inc  - Co-Founder &amp; CEO of ViaWest   [62]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc  - EVP &amp; CFO   [63]

The Calgary One data center has essentially been completed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nancy Phillips,  Shaw Communications Inc  - Co-Founder &amp; CEO of ViaWest   [64]

It was about CAD34 million in 2015, roughly CAD24 million of that, I think, was in the fourth quarter of the CAD70 million that was in the fourth quarter. That's largely behind us. It will really be some small incremental associated with customer acquisition

Just wondering if you could update us on dynamics, M&amp;A dynamics, in that space in the US? Obviously we'll hear a little bit more in early December on this, but wanted to get your thoughts. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nancy Phillips,  Shaw Communications Inc  - Co-Founder &amp; CEO of ViaWest   [68]

Demand, it's a busy market. I'm sure you watched some of the transactions that have happened over the last several months; 2015 was a busy year and continues to be. I think we're very -- and always have been -- a very disciplined Company as we take a look at acquisitions

Very pleased with the Applied Trust acquisition we did in July, albeit small. We think it will have a tremendous impact in the service portfolio. And we're already seeing very good early attraction, or take-down with our current customer base for those services

Clearly, security is top of mind for most companies. I would say that the fact that they are a security assessment and mitigation company is an important component in terms of the IT spend today

So we take a look at our multitude of things. That happened to be a great tuck-in service that we'd been looking at. We continue to take a look on an opportunistic basis for the right type of assets that are going to help us scale the business and continue to expand our footprint

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions)
 The first question comes from Mr. Jeff Fan with Scotiabank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [2]

Thanks and good afternoon, and congratulations on the media sale yesterday

More of a bigger-picture question on the media transaction: I guess in the past, when you look at the Canadian market, it's quite vertically integrated. And if we look back a number of years ago on the Canwest acquisition, there were certainly benefits that one could envision by being vertically integrated, although some of those benefits may have gone away. Just wondering if you can talk around what maybe some of the potential vertically integrated benefits that you might be giving up as part of this transaction that you are proposing with Corus?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [3]

Yes, thanks, Jeff. It's Jay. I'll start with that

I think, as you acknowledged in the way you asked your question, since our acquisition of Canwest in 2010, the media regulatory environment has really evolved or reduced the strategic benefits of vertical integration between BDUs and content providers. At the same time, we believe the regulatory protections are in place, concerning our strong relationship with Corus, we think we're in a position to ensure that there's no negative strategic consequences that will result from the sale of Shaw Media to Corus

We kind of think of it as a vertical relationship instead of vertical integration. I would add to that, that it's important to note that we have concluded expansive multi-year carriage agreements with both Shaw Media and Corus Services that actually codify those arrangements for the years ahead as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [4]

Does this have any implications for shomi and -- as a product and as a joint venture with Rogers?

Barb Williams,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; President of Shaw Media   [5]

Hi, it's Barb. I can start. Jay may want to add

I can speak to the advantage that shomi had by having Shaw Media as part of Shaw in its ownership of shomi because we at Shaw Media had access to [s-log] rights to be able to contribute to shomi, and that was an important piece of shomi's ongoing success. What we have agreed in the go forward is that, at Corus, we'll continue to support, and is obligated to continue to support, the access of those s-log rights for shomi, so there should be no interruption at all in the flow of programming via Corus and on into shomi, just the way it did when Shaw Media was owned by Shaw

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP of Corporate Development &amp; Business Planning   [6]

Jeff, it's Trevor. Just clearly there was a lot of interaction between Shaw Media and Shaw Communications, and throughout this, as we separate the Company, there's a number of situations and a number of commercial agreements that we've made sure that stay in place between the two Organizations post the sale being completed, and shomi is one of them

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [7]

Okay. And then I want to ask about the FreeRange TV launch. I guess, having seen the [Comcast] service, it's quite similar in many ways. But specific to you guys, because of the fact that you have Shaw Direct outside of your cable footprint, you're offering FreeRange as a service to Shaw Direct customer. What prevents you from offering the service as a bit of a stand-alone subscription service, almost similar to what Sling TV offers by Dish in the US?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [8]

Sure. Jeff, let me take that two ways. One is, FreeRange TV itself is a product and a consumer experience that, by its fundamental design, is an extension of your video subscription in the home, and either that being a Shaw Cable subscription or a Shaw Direct subscription. So, by its very nature, the FreeRange product itself is free to consumers and allows -- has the guiding principle that you can take the services that you subscribe to at your home and, at no extra charge, consume them on other devices in your home, turning your smartphones into additional TVs and other devices on the go, whether it's on the Shaw Go WiFi network or anywhere in Canada. FreeRange is, as a first deliverable in a product and experience, absolutely an extension of your home subscription

I think where you're correctly heading though is, well, that's the application and experience. The back office that has been built to support FreeRange is the single IP all in the cloud video back office that will support all of our IP cloud-based video applications and executions going forward. So, there is certainly nothing technical to prevent us from using that same back office infrastructure to provide video to, say, wireless data customers or some other kind of application

What does need to be worked out, and there aren't any immediate plans in this regard, and as you can appreciate, it's probably a little premature, which does need to be worked out is just the go-to-market considerations, what it means competitively, and then also the rights issues. Because the rights that are on FreeRange TV have been acquired, sometimes at an additional cost, as an extension to the home subscriptions. There's rights and business stuff that would need to be sorted out, but this is Shaw's IP cloud-based video delivery infrastructure that we'll be using for all of our applications going forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [9]

Okay, thanks, guys

Operator   [11]

Our next question is from Vince Valentini of TD Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [12]

Yes, thanks very much. Your internet subscribers on the Business Network Services side were slightly negative, which shocked me a little bit. Is there any re-categorization of maybe how you treat the data revenue being sold to business customers that they're not a discrete internet subscriber anymore, or is this actually you lost subscribers this quarter?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [13]

Yes, I think what you're seeing is the one -- well, I shouldn't call it a one-time impact. The impact of losing a significant number of internet subscribers at the work facilities in Fort McMurray, and those weren't competitive losses. Those were just camps actually closing down

They come from -- as we've talked about in the past, those deals are all -- have been negotiated with significant supply chain organization, so they're not necessarily huge margin deals, and good value is provided to them. But as you look at RGUs, I think you'll see a continued directional trend as the business population of northern Alberta decreases

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [14]

Okay, that's good color. Thanks, Jay

On the consumer side, your revenue growth continues to be better than your RGU growth. Can you give us any more color on what's going on with the mix shift of your customer base, and maybe most importantly, in the home phone side, given how dramatically you've changed your bundling policies and your pricing strategy? Are you starting to see the customers you're keeping generating a lot more revenue than the ones you're losing?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [15]

Yes, you're seeing in the mix certainly a focus on lifetime value customers and a lot greater segmentation, so I think we are certainly headed in the direction aspirationally of where you suggest. We're not totally there today because of the way that the packaging and bundling and competitive dynamic works

We weren't disappointed with the trend Q4 to Q1 in internet and video subscribers. We've got a little bit more work to do on phone to get that back to where we want to go

And then, as you can tell, it's not business as usual around here. We're making very concrete moves to try and shift the RGU trajectory in the consumer business. And I guess as you work your way through the execution of these transactions, that really becomes our next big challenge

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; CFO   [16]

Vince, it's Vito here. The only other thing I'll add is, of course, the Q1 results on the consumer side reflect the benefit of the two price increases last year. You might recall both on video and internet, we had increases in January 2015 and August of 2015. And obviously, as we move through the balance of the year here, we lose the benefit of at least the January year-over-year increase

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [17]

Okay, thanks

One last one -- bigger picture. A lot of people are pointing out that the media division generated more free cash flow than your wireless business will likely generate in the first couple of years, so your dividend pay-out ratio is going to be in the range of 100%. Can you talk holistically how you guys view this?
 Do you think of all of the proceeds from Shaw Media, including the eventual monetization of Corus shares -- that fully funds all of your wireless initial acquisition, plus the CapEx, plus any other spectrum you may have to buy over the next couple of years? Do you view that as one funding the other, so the pay-out ratio isn't really relevant short term?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; CFO   [18]

Yes, Vince, it's Vito. Definitely a lot of moving pieces here over the next several years. When you look at the Corus dividend, when you look at our share holding restrictions on the Corus shares, we believe long term in that investment at this time, and the ability for that investment to grow and the prospects, as you've heard us consistently refer to

But there's no doubt about it that with the media business coming out of our numbers, and wireless coming in, we're very excited about the long-term growth prospects. I think these transactions really set us up for dividend growth on a long-term basis

You hit the nail on the head: Over the next couple years, the pay-out ratio is going to be at elevated levels. When we look at all of the levers we have available to us, some of which you described, we don't see that as an issue whatsoever to continue to maintain our dividend. It's been 13 straight years for us of dividend increase, and we're focused on getting back to those here as we move into the short-term period beyond the next couple of years

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [19]

Okay. Thanks, guys

Our next question is from Aravinda Galappatthige

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [22]

Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions

Obviously, the Shaw sale ensures that you maintain a very steady balance sheet. But I was wondering, given that there is an approval process to go through, and I'm thinking more specifically about the Corus Class B shareholder vote, is there some other contingency options that you can fall back on? I know that you've talked about real estate sales, non-core sales, et cetera. In terms of contingencies, I'm just wondering what other options are on the table

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; CFO   [23]

Well, we do have a bridge in place, obviously. The timing of these -- first of all, let me just say we have a high degree of confidence that these two transactions will close. Clearly there's regulatory approvals that need to take place, and we'll let that obviously move forward. But we have a high degree of confidence

In the event that there's a timing issue, we do have a bridge in place, which has been secured for the entire proceeds -- a CAD1.7 billion, CAD1.6 billion bridge. Beyond that, as we talked a little bit earlier about, we can take our leverage up, but we don't think that we need to do that in any way shape or form. We're in good shape and we've got our bases covered

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [24]

Thanks very much for that. Just with respect to the earlier question about the free cash flow impact to the sale of Shaw Media, I was wondering if you can clarify the CRTC benefit obligation which runs through you guys every year? Would that pass on to Corus with the sale, or would that stay with Shaw Communications?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP of Corporate Development &amp; Business Planning   [25]

Hi, it's Trevor. That does pass along with the sale. So, that obligation, which actually runs out at the end of FY17 for Corus, but that does go along with the transaction

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [26]

Okay, great. Thank you. I'll leave it there

Next question is from Greg MacDonald with Macquarie

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [29]

Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Question is on rating agencies: I believe it was S&amp;P that has a negative outlook. I'm going to, like Vince, think of this deal as wholly funding the WIND acquisition

Vito, you made comment on the fact that, pro forma, your leverage ratios are within the guidance range that you have. This is actually -- if you think about this deal funding WIND relative to an all-debt financing for WIND, your leverage is actually lower, and that's not including the CAD800 million in Corus stock. Is it safe to say that a rating downgrade risk is lower, or dare say, off the table? Or I guess another way: Have you spoken to the rating agencies about this deal, or had you spoken to them about this deal before it's closed?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; CFO   [30]

Yes, Greg, clearly the rating agencies wrote after the WIND transaction, and that's what you're referring to. At that time, we couldn't give them the entire picture because we weren't there yet, and so they were reacting to the information that was in the public marketplace and that was appropriate for them to react to

Pre-transaction here, pre the [Marina] announcement, we obviously briefed them on this update. I'm not sure if you've caught up to it. Moody's reported yesterday -- they've confirmed our rating. DBRS has -- I don't want to put words in their mouth, if you read the report, has confirmed that we will likely come out of this at close at investment grade. We haven't seen S&amp;P's update yet at the time of this call, but we've had very constructive dialogue

The credit market has reacted very favorably to the announcement of it -- of the media sale. I think you hit the nail on the head: leverage is down. There obviously is an earnings free cash flow delta versus the existing business footprint that the agency has got to get their head around, but we have a high, high degree of confidence we're an investment-grade entity here and we'll continue to manage that way

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [31]

Okay, so, for clarity, you hadn't spoken to S&amp;P and --

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; CFO   [32]

We have spoken to S&amp;P. We have spoken to S&amp;P, and I think if not -- I don't want to speak for them, but I'm sure there will be something out if not by end of day today, probably tomorrow

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP of Corporate Development &amp; Business Planning   [33]

I think it's clear that they wanted to let everything filter through, along with the Q1 results that we released this morning, before they released their news release tonight

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [34]

Okay, thanks, Trevor. That makes a lot of sense

Second question: It wasn't too long ago this Company was talking about the merits of vertical integration. I know a lot has changed. Regulation and tech in particular impacts on unbundling and whatnot, and that's certainly part of the equation. Is that entirely what drove the decision to sell Media, in addition to the fact that it's a benefit to moving more toward a pure broadband-focused Company, or were there other things that affect -- just help us understand all of that, thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [35]

Hey, Greg, it's Jay. We'll sort of walk you through -- these deals have landed kind of on top of each other. They really have come out of a 12- to 15-month very detailed and careful consideration of the kind of Shaw Communications that we are trying to build, and what the appropriate way to optimize our asset mix was. And I think you can over-read the symmetrical nature of the cash, and put them in causal relationships with each other. We are really trying to find the best way forward

Clearly, we knew there had to be a play to create a ubiquitous network, both smart and dumb, with some of Shaw experiences on it, and then also to provide connectivity to all of those experiences. When we looked at the Media assets, these assets belong together. And it was our view that the assets belonged together being owned by a media company, and that there would be a level of focus of the pure-play nature, both of these two next entities to make sense. It was really that strategic rationale, in terms of the proper spot for the assets, the pure-play focus of management, that took us through the sale

In terms of the benefits or not benefits of vertical integration, those have gone away gradually over time. I wouldn't overstate the drivers (multiple speakers)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP of Corporate Development &amp; Business Planning   [36]

Yes, Greg -- and, Jay, I think that's well said. I think this review that we went through that started 14, 15 months ago, we really looked at the value that Shaw Media had done, created for our shareholders, and we're thinking, well, what's the next stage of that?
 We felt like the two companies combined to make one pure-play leading integrated media company was the best way to continue to create value for our shareholders going forward. And I think we were very comfortable taking a smaller equity stake in a larger company, and participating in that value creation for Shaw shareholders through that mechanism versus other ways

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [37]

How important is the continued relationship with Corus? I mean, you can get access to content. I don't want to say in a non-commercial way. It will be a commercial deal if you decide that you want to continue to leverage Media, but how important is it that you have that relationship with them, and would it have been as easy to sell the asset if you didn't?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP of Corporate Development &amp; Business Planning   [38]

Yes, listen, I think we're excited about the upside with the company going forward. We're excited about that we continue to have a relationship, a strong relationship with the company, that we've got commercial relationships in place. I sort of look at the overall ecosystem within distribution and content being important, and are all one of the same system, but there's lots of safeguards in place

I don't know, Jay, if you have anything else to add?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [39]

Yes, I think the vertical relationship is important. I'd certainly add, though, that Shaw is a relationship-based Company, and we have pretty good relationships with all of our content providers, [VI] and not, and so we're an Organization that can get deals done. I think you've seen that as a track record

I think the relationship is actually important. Speaking plainly, too, I think that it's emotionally important, too. This is a business that we built together

Our colleagues on Shaw Media and our colleagues on Shaw have loved working together, and there's a tremendous sense of what's been created and accomplished. And so, I would make the argument even without a significant ownership position, we're somewhat aligned just from shared experiences and relationships

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [40]

Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys

Operator   [41]

Our next question is from Maher Yaghi with Desjardins Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Capital Markets - Analyst   [42]

Yes, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to discuss something you talked about in your MD&amp;A about the conversion of all your video signals in major cities in western Canada to digital from -- so, in terms of this conversion, can you talk about what this will mean in terms of bandwidth gains? As you add on top of that the DOCSIS 3.1 conversion, can you talk a little bit about your bandwidth run rate here, and when do you expect to have 1-gig internet speeds in the market? I know this is sensitive information, but can you talk a little bit about your technology platform here? I have another question to follow up

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [43]

For sure, Maher. We would be happy to give you some color here

By the way, we've been doing everything you've told us to do for the last number of quarters, too. I'd just like to point that out as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Capital Markets - Analyst   [44]

I noticed what you did on wireless, yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [45]

Yes, thank you. Yes, we've got a multi-year plan in terms of our network, and it's really not unlike a capital allocation process, but sort of a spectrum allocation process in terms of our cable networks. Our digital network upgrade went through two phases, and we removed all of the tier specialty channels off analog a couple years ago nationally. And then last year we removed all of the basic services off analog in Vancouver and the lower mainland

This year we will be removing all of the analog services from the vast, vast -- this fiscal year -- from the vast, vast, vast majority of our customers, certainly everywhere that's a city, so going down to communities like Cranbrook and Castlegar and so forth. In some of the really rural areas, we'll do it in the next fiscal year. We don't actually have a need for the bandwidth in those areas

That's all about moving through fully floating DOCSIS 3 to DOCSIS 3.1, and creating the right mix of carriers in order to enable that. I should say as well that with the use of the launch of X1 and the move to the IP cloud-based platform, first on VOD, that will also allow us, as we convert those boxes over, to eliminate VOD capacity digitally on the network to reposition from managed internet and super high speed internet

Ultimately, this IP platform that has been built will, over time, replace analog services -- I mean, replace digital services and QAM also. And while that may seem a long ways away, as you think through specialty services, multi-cultural services, there will be lots of opportunities with our hybrid boxes to reclaim bandwidth. So, there is a multi-year plan that has been funded and is very clear in terms of managing that migration towards super high speed services

What's terrific about DOCSIS 3.1 is it allows us to bring all of our customers super high speed services at once, and allows us to step in to those super high speed services as we continue to upgrade the plan. We will be continuing to do significant speed increases for our mainstream product as we move forward, and you'll probably see our mainstream, main street product be in the hundreds of megs first before being 1 gig, but none of that is too far away. We have confirmed publicly that we will roll out DOCSIS 3.1 modems and network in this calendar year

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Capital Markets - Analyst   [46]

Okay. The follow-up question I had is: In Ontario and Quebec, there were rate increases that are taking place in February between CAD4 to CAD6 in Quebec, and CAD6 to CAD8 in Ontario. Can you talk about the rate increases you're seeing taking place in western Canada in 2016 on your side and from the competition?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [47]

Yes, let me get caught up just on your frame of reference. The rate increases you're talking about are competitive rate increases?

Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Capital Markets - Analyst   [48]

In terms of internet, home phone and video combined

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [49]

Oh, got it. If you look at -- what we've said to our consumers, we postponed one rate increase from September to January, and then ended up with two in the same year. And you can see some of that even in the comparative RGU numbers, as Vito was suggesting. We said to our consumers -- for simplicity, we are going to look at rates once a year, and we're going to do it in the summertime. And so I think you'll see us make some adjustments to our rates in the summertime

Some of this really is FX related, in terms of where we land there, too, of course. A number of our expenses are in American dollars, and our revenue's in Canadian dollars, so that may impact the blend of rate increases that we do and rate adjustments we do over the summer. I would think you could think about our summer rate adjustment in a similar quantum as what we did last August

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Capital Markets - Analyst   [50]

Okay, great. Just one last question to Vito: Maybe it was discussed before on the call, but certainly you're focusing your Organization on telecom. And in terms of CapEx, I just wanted to get a little bit more clarity on when the heavy spending, the CAD250 million of spending on wireless to start with on the WIND side -- when this heavy CapEx spending is going to taper off so that you'll get back on this -- the dividend growth model that you have spoken about having had for 13 years in a row

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; CFO   [51]

Yes, we've signaled obviously CAD250 million of incremental capital on the WIND side of the Business to upgrade to the LTE. That will take approximately a two-year time frame, commencing sometime during the course of FY16 leaking through to FY17

It's a two-year time period that there's significant cash capital expenditures in the WIND business. And then once we move beyond that, I think we have a high degree of confidence we're back into free cash flow growth, and then we'll evaluate dividends as we move forward through that period

But it's very, very exciting to have, on a pro forma basis, 30% of our revenue in a growth time frame. In order to have dividend increase, you need EBITDA growth, and we definitely feel like we're in a stronger position, upon closing of these transactions, moving forward than we've been in a long time

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Capital Markets - Analyst   [52]

Great, thank you for that clarity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [53]

Operator   [54]

Next question is from Drew McReynolds from RBC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [55]

Yes, thanks very much for taking my questions. Just a few, first for you, Vito, and then maybe one for Barb

Just back to the ratings agency dynamic -- just based on your comments there, can you just confirm? I know coming out of the WIND transaction, free cash flow coverage was a little bit in the spotlight. Are you saying after this Shaw Media transaction that you should be [falling] on free cash flow coverage relative to the concern prior to the transaction?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; CFO   [56]

Well, I don't think it's the free cash flow. I think it's the leverage that we've given clarity to. When you look at the two transactions, it's effectively leverage neutral, and then obviously it's not free cash flow neutral

What the rating agencies are digesting, obviously with the recent transaction -- and two of them have reported, so I encourage you to read through the reports -- as Trevor mentioned, we'll probably see S&amp;P either end of today or tomorrow morning -- is that exact FCF, free cash flow, implication, which as we've said, over the next two years is going to be reduced relative to where we've been, given the capital, primarily the capital of WIND and the loss of the Shaw Media business

That's clearly what the rating agencies are looking through and assessing the quality of the earnings against that capital expenditure profile. They -- again, don't want to be speaking for them, and I encourage you to read their reports. They love the strategy. They understand why we've made these moves, and they are just assessing, obviously, the short-term implications of them from a purely rating agency and from a credit profile perspective

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [57]

Okay, yes, that's great. Then just sticking with the free cash flow theme, just in terms of the press release, in terms of sticking or committing to the DRIP with your Corus shares through FY17, can you just clarify, is that on restricted stock only or would that be on your full stake?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP of Corporate Development &amp; Business Planning   [58]

Yes, that's on the full stake, and it's related to -- think about the DRIP as related to whenever it's on the restricted stock. So, as the third falls off after the first year, then we have the flexibility to take cash dividends versus stock dividends. It mirrors the restricted shares -- the DRIP

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [59]

Yes, that's great, Trevor. Thanks. And tax implications on the transaction from Shaw's perspective?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; CFO   [60]

You're allowed to defer the taxation on the share consideration you take back. And so we estimate approximately CAD25 million to CAD30 million short-term tax implications upon closure of the deal or shortly thereafter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [61]

Okay, that's helpful. Thanks, Vito

One for you, Barb: I think we're all kind of wondering -- looking for an update on anything you can say on [carriage] negotiations heading into the unbundled environment, both from a Shaw Media perspective and maybe from a distribution perspective. I don't see a lot of kind of clarity around this, but it does seem as if there's been some settlement of carriage negotiations from your perspective. I'm just wondering, where are we in that whole process, first from Shaw Media's standpoint, and then maybe from Shaw TV standpoint with the other broadcasters?

Barb Williams,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; President of Shaw Media   [62]

Yes, sure. Just to the larger question, I think Jay already referenced it, we have carriage agreements in place for Corus in the new combined Company out a number of years. So, that piece of the puzzle is solved. We know Shaw Media, as it exists today, has agreements obviously with the other BDUs that have their own timelines and time frames on them, and we are negotiating those agreements as they come up for renewal

I think, as far as unbundling, unless Talk TV is concerned, I think we as broadcasters really believe in our channel, believe in our brand, believe in strong carriage and strong viewership going forward, and we're not planning at the moment for a significant change from that point of view. We're looking to renew our agreements as they come up. But clearly as the year unfolds and we see what the impacts are, that may affect future negotiations with our other carriers

But a lot of these things are going to come together at once, right? We're going to see what the impact is of Let's Talk TV. We will hopefully see this transaction close and put the channels together for future negotiations, and some of this is going to have to sort itself out over this next year or so

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP of Corporate Development &amp; Business Planning   [63]

Our next question is from Tim Casey of BMO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [67]

Thank you, good afternoon. I just wanted to revisit a couple items. One, just on the overall economic situation in Alberta, you've indicated that there was some subscriber losses from the areas and the camps in northern Alberta, and that's obviously been reflected in your numbers on a lagged basis. Are you seeing any early signs, or are you expecting any consumer slowdown just in terms of, broadly, the economic situation in Alberta, or has the consumer side -- from what you can see, is it holding up?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [68]

Yes, Tim, it's Jay. The economic situation in Alberta is real, for sure. And we have seen some trending that certainly suggests -- certainly if you look on a year-over-year basis, remembering, on a year-over-year basis you're kind of comparing to boom times in Alberta. When it was hot, it was pretty hot. We've certainly seen a trend in churn and disconnects, and fewer gross adds in the Alberta market

We're fortunate to be in a big base. We're fortunate to have geographic diversity. British Columbia is doing terrific. I'm not sure it's a big factor in the numbers that you can see when you look at our consumer business holistically, but it's absolutely real

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [69]

So, in terms of your fiscal planning, are you expecting a slowdown as we progress through the year, in terms of go-to-market strategies in Alberta?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [70]

We are sort of -- we're kind of thinking about the context in terms of the external context in being like it is, and certainly there's a slowdown in Alberta. If you're asking whether or not we see a deterioration in our current RGU trends from the trends that we've had in the past, we think we're doing more than enough moves in the market to offset whatever impact that could have. And so we're certainly not planning for a deterioration in our RGU trends in the consumer business from where they are today

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; CFO   [71]

Tim, it's Vito. I'll just add, of course, any time you've got this situation, it's really hard to pinpoint the RGU losses and where they are coming from and what the contribution is. But I agree wholeheartedly with Jay; there's an impact here. And as we get together as an executive team or going forward, we're always -- you deal with the realities of the short term, and you have your eye to the long term as well, and there's lots of tradeoffs in that decision-making progress. But we obviously love our asset base, and we're prepared to invest where we believe the long-term benefit is

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [72]

That's great. Thank you for the color

The other question I had was more of a big-picture question to you, Vito and Jay. It's with respect to capital priorities. You've got a core network business that requires capital but is self-funding, and you're going to layer in a wireless business that will require an initial spend, and then I'm sure there will be spectrum and more spending down the road as you fill out. Then you've got ViaWest in the US, which is still in a free cash flow deficit position

How do you think about the demands on your overall capital pool, and how will you prioritize that as you address the needs of the three businesses? I understand that two of the businesses are really going to be run as one almost, other than Ontario, but how do you think about that?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; CFO   [73]

I'll start off, and then Jay and Trevor as well. Barb just slipped me a note, and she said she'd really like a ring-side seat here as we as an executive team make those decisions and everybody vies for it

I actually think it's a bit of an embarrassment -- I won't say embarrassment of riches, maybe that's the wrong word, but it's a great position to be in, frankly, and I take that back to the growth profile that we're dealing with. There's a inner-connectivity between these three businesses, if you will -- the core, the wireless and [whatnot]. So, I'm not sure they are all totally distinctive; definitely distinctive as we're reporting them. But as we think about our connectivity platform, there's definitely overlap and how can we leverage those investments

Return on invested capital -- we're going to get focused on exactly what does that look like and what each of the business units are delivering to some extent, and there is going to have to be some choices. But from where I sit, I definitely believe we can continue to fund those three businesses, units if you will -- the base, the wireless and ViaWest as required. But like any other business, quite frankly, you've got choices to make along that

Nancy's here. We haven't heard from Nancy about how ViaWest is going. We had a great quarter, but very, very excited about how that business is progressing. Nancy, why don't you just --

Nancy Phillips,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Co-founder &amp; CEO of ViaWest   [74]

Yes, listen, I think we certainly ended the year strong with the bookings momentum we had, and as we entered the first quarter, and we do have the Calgary data center up and operational, and we're seeing some very good early traction. So, if there is a positive, maybe, in Alberta, we do see private accounts definitely moving towards an outsourced model for both our data center and cloud-based services there. We're continuing to move very progressively in terms of the plan for 2016, and have seen a continued positive bookings impact in the first quarter and in December as well that will lead to obviously staying on track in terms of our plan for 2016

I think we've had very disciplined [push] around return on invested capital, and obviously take a look at the optionality in terms of our geographic expansion, both from a cloud and data center perspective. I think our movement towards hybrid, as we're seeing some of the customer demands change, certainly is starting to see more movement towards our cloud-based service set -- and not that data centers aren't important, but we do see the platform starting to evolve a little bit, and certainly our capital priorities will follow suit

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; CFO   [76]

The next question is from Robert Peters of Credit Suisse

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Robert Peters,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [79]

Thanks very much for taking my question. Maybe stepping back to shomi for a second, we saw the investment in that tick up a little bit in the quarter, in terms of the loss at the JV. I was just wondering, can you give us an update on the progress and how things are going at shomi? Are we getting to the point where we are getting to the high watermark in terms of investment there, or is it still a few more quarters to go?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [80]

Yes, it's Jay. I think when you look at the new digital properties, it's the nature of this kind of investment that you're going to see the arc that you're seeing in terms of the start up, and the investment start up. We're working through with our partner what the right level and approach is, and when we'll start to see things level off

For sure, the highest expenditures are at the front end, and I think you'll see some trends in the medium term. We haven't really disclosed sort of the element -- I don't want to go too much farther than that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP of Corporate Development &amp; Business Planning   [81]

Nor should we. Obviously, it's a joint venture with another partner that, from the economics point of view, it is an investment that we're carrying, and we'll continue to talk about it as an investment going forward

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions)
 Our first question is from Jeff Fan of Scotiabank. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [2]

Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Where do I start? I guess we'll start with WIND, since Alek is on the line. You guys gave some numbers on the subscribers, 980,000. But the last time you gave any numbers on the financials was related back to, I think, calendar Q3, so that was the September quarter. So wondering if you guys can give us some indication of where ARPU is at currently? And also the revenue and EBITDA level, just to give us some color as to how things are trending since the third quarter last year?

Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and President of WIND   [3]

Hi, Jeff, it's Alek here. Things are trending extremely well. The ARPU is about CAD35. When we look at where things are, in terms of gross and churn and net, everything is on track exactly where the business plan calls for it to be. In terms of some specifics, gross came in a tiny bit lower, but churn was substantially lower, so we over-achieved on net. But the momentum that we saw at the end of the year last year has continued, so it's been very, very good

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [4]

What about the capital that's required for an LTE? I think the number of CAD250 million was talked about before. Wondering if you guys can give us some update on the CapEx that's required? I guess, specifically, upgrading the network to the point that Shaw is comfortable in putting its brand on the network out West?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CFO   [5]

Thank you for giving us the opportunity to talk about WIND. Maybe I'll jump in, and flip it over to Alek to give you more details. Obviously, our guidance was -- it did not include any WIND guidance related to FY16. And I reiterate that, from an EBITDA perspective, the business is performing in line, if not slightly ahead of expectations, so we're all good on that. And really, the reason why we didn't include any WIND guidance is the timing of capital, as you're alluding to

We're very, very comfortable in the CAD250 million number that we provided to the Street, from a perspective of the LTE upgrade. And what the teams are working through, frankly, is the cadence of that as relates to FY16 versus FY17. And bottom line, we've had -- we've been with this business now for 45 days, and just didn't feel comfortable putting that number out there as it relates to FY16

Frankly, from a timing perspective, we want to get on with this as quickly as possible, and the sooner the better. So from an overall end market perspective, we're going to go as quickly as we can, but obviously, we want to give the technical teams the appropriate time to make sure that we're spending that money appropriately. And with that, Alek, I'll send it over to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and President of WIND   [6]

Jeff, look, there's really two parts to this. The first part was the upgrade of the existing WIND network and the swap-out of some of the gear that was causing us issues. That has all gone extremely smoothly, and is well ahead of schedule. So Vancouver was done some time ago. As of earlier this week, Calgary is now finished, and we're on track to have Edmonton done by the summer. The net effect for customers -- and we're starting to see it on the blogs and everywhere else -- the net effect for customers is increases of the speed and throughput that are 2 times, 2.5 times what they were experiencing before

We're starting to see, in markets like Vancouver, where the swap-out was finished, 25% more data usage. So we're very comfortable where that's going. As Vito indicated, we stand by the CapEx forecast for LTE, and we're very comfortable that that build will also happen on time or ahead of time. A lot of the civil work that can sometimes be lengthy has been completed for a big chunk of it, and we also are starting to see some of the benefits of being owned by Shaw, because of some of the infrastructure and real estate that they have here that allows us to actually complete that build in an efficient way. So again, Jeff, I'm very, very comfortable that everything is on track for that LTE build

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [7]

And maybe just one last quick thing. I think at the time of the acquisition, the projection for 2015 was CAD485 million in revenue in 2015 and CAD65 million in EBITDA in 2015. I guess those numbers were met for calendar 2015, just so that we can put some numbers around what expectation was?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CFO   [8]

We can confirm that, Jeff

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [9]

Okay, thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and President of WIND   [10]

In fact it would be fair to say EBITDA was maybe a tick higher than the CAD65 million

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [11]

Okay. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [12]

The next question is from Vince Valentini of TD Securities. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [13]

One last thing on wireless, and then I have a cable question. But has there been any change since Shaw has taken over, in terms of the amount of money being devoted to marketing and the amount of investment in new retail stores?

Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and President of WIND   [14]

No, not at all. We're still on track with the original business plan, and so no change at all there, Vince

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [15]

Okay. Thanks. So on the cable side, the video subscribers, I certainly found a bit weak this quarter. Can you give any color? I'm not sure if your comments, Vito, on the business side, in terms of how you count RGUs, if that specifically impacted the video subscriber counts in the business segment? So maybe you can clarify that. And then more importantly, on the consumer segment, is this Alberta economy weakness? Or is it TELUS being aggressive again? Or is it more cord cutting? Any commentary you can give us on the trends there would be great

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [16]

Vince, it's Jay. Maybe I'll start with the business RGUs, because it's a little bit simpler to get your head around. For sure, there's some economics to the video losses on the business side, but they're not as material as some of the other things that are going on with just under 4,000 disconnects, because the business wasn't there anymore. But the majority of the disconnects were related to packaging changes. We used to include video with a bunch of our legacy Internet packages, and as we moved our way through the digital network upgrade, it no longer made sense to include video, and give customers the option to move -- choose video. So as a result, about 10,000 of that RGU loss is just a repackaging issue

The good news about that repackaging issue is it doesn't come with any revenue loss, and in fact, we lower our network fees, because we're not paying video network fees on that revenue. So the business one's a little bit easier to explain. As you move over to the -- and there's certainly economic issues on business. It's well reported, in terms of what's happening in our economy here, but we continue to be quite bullish about where we're headed

On the consumer side, obviously, we're not happy with our video or RGU numbers in this quarter, as well. For sure, you're seeing some economic issues. In video, we did see disproportionate losses in Edmonton, Fort McMurray, Calgary and Saskatoon, vis a vis British Columbia and more specifically Vancouver. In Internet, it was really more Fort McMurray and Saskatchewan that actually saw declines, and -- but bigger increases in British Columbia, for sure. And in phone, interestingly enough, the main outlier was actually in Calgary

So we're seeing different markets in the economy react in slightly different ways, but I would say if you're looking at the trend of quarter over quarter, certainly the differences in consumer RGUs are primarily economic. That being said, we're being very active in the marketplace, in things like FreeRange TV, and hoping for and driving towards improvement in the future. A bit early for those to show improvement in Q2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [17]

So nothing changed, in terms of competitive intensity from TELUS, Jay?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [18]

Yes, I wouldn't -- it's fiercely competitive, but it's been fiercely competitive for a long time. I wouldn't say there's been any -- we get the odd dust-up from time to time, but I think the competitive balance remains in place

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [19]

Okay. Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [20]

Our next question is from Phillip Huang of Barclays

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [21]

Hi, thanks, good afternoon. I just want to clarify, go back to wireless for a second. On the equipment upgrade that you just mentioned, was that -- so are we done for Vancouver and Calgary now, in terms of upgrading the hardware for LTE? Or what is the equipment upgrade for?

Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and President of WIND   [22]

So what we were doing was swapping out some 3G gear. We had Alcatel-Lucent 3G gear in those markets, and some of that gear had software that wasn't being fully supported. It was causing us issues. This is something that I inherited a year ago, and we put a plan together to actually swap out that 3G gear. So we put in new Nokia 3G gear, so that is the 3G swap out, different from the LTE upgrade

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [23]

Got it. So when you eventually upgrade to LTE, do you need to swap that out again, or is that compatible with LTE?

Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and President of WIND   [24]

No, the two will -- the two pieces, the two types of gear, will co-exist. You're going to have LTE riding on --

Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [25]

Got you, okay

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and President of WIND   [26]

AWS-3 spectrum. And this is the gear that's running the. AWS-1 spectrum

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [27]

Phillip, it's Jay. Just to make sure that we're transparent about the two things that are going on here, the 3G radio upgrade that's happening happened in Vancouver, finished in Calgary last night, and is happening in Edmonton as we speak also allows us to enable the AWS-1 spectrum that WIND picked up as part of some of the spectrum transaction. So it's not only a radio improvement, but it's a spectrum improvement. And we built all those costs into the CAD250 million number that you have. So while it's not directly related to LTE, it's certainly related to the performance of our network

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and President of WIND   [28]

It's a very good clarification. So it is -- we're literally, in those markets, going from having 10 megahertz of AWS-1 to 20 megahertz of AWS-1, which is obviously helping, in terms of the big capacity increase. And yes, 100% of that swap-out cost is already budgeted in the numbers that have previously been given to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [29]

Got it, okay. No, that's very helpful. And then another question on WIND. I don't know if you guys were on the call earlier with Cogeco, but we heard it loud and clear this morning that Louis said on the earnings call that they would be delighted to discuss any potential partnership opportunities on WIND

What are your thoughts on that? On the surface, it does seem like it could make sense for you, right? Given that it could allow you to focus more of your investments in the Western Canadian footprint versus the Ontario footprint, which arguably would be less relevant for your [fixed life] footprint?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [30]

Yes, Phil, this is Brad. I -- we certainly have chatted with Louis a little bit, and know he's -- there's some interest there. I think it's early for us to be determining how far, what type of partnerships we have. We're so excited about the opportunity in Ontario, believe there's options for us as we go forward, either in partnerships or not. But we're going to be talking to everyone, and looking at all options, and what makes best sense for the business and for Shaw, and we'll see where it goes. But it's never a phone call away

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [31]

Right. Do you foresee any potential complications to such discussions, just given that there's existing roaming agreements that WIND has on the incumbents? And I would imagine that BCE, for example, would probably not be happy if you strengthened one of their direct competitors

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [32]

I think they're two separate things. I think strategically, BCE may not think that was in their interest if there was a strengthening of one of their competitors. But the roaming agreements are obviously completely separate, the roaming agreements that are in place, and some of the changes in the roaming rates are all being mandated. So I think the two are unrelated

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [33]

Right. Okay. Maybe one final one from me. With respect to Mobilicity, we observed some increased marketing of the Mobilicity brand in Western Canada by Rogers. And just given the positioning of Mobilicity's offering, it seemed like the brand is aimed at gaining some market share back from WIND, and certainly from the numbers that you guys talked about today, it doesn't seem like it's having much of an impact. But was wondering if that's something that you guys observed, as well, some increased marketing by Mobilicity?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [34]

Look, our friends at Rogers seem to have a lot of brands going on there. They've got Fido, they've got Chatr, they've got Mobilicity. We see some of those brands coming in and out of the market. I'm a bit confused, to be honest with you. I really don't know what they're doing with that one

But I think that they -- we saw some aggressive pricing at the end of the calendar first quarter, and it all changed, and it's been pulled out of the market. We haven't really felt any of that. So it's -- we're very good with that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [35]

Great. Thanks very much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [36]

The next question is from Drew McReynolds of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [37]

Thanks very much. Just a couple of follow-ups. I guess first, on just around the FreeRange TV and some of the success you're seeing there. I'm just wondering if you can frame it for us? In the absence of the Alberta headwind, which obviously is -- and hopefully clearly cyclical, would you otherwise feel that you're gaining some real traction with FreeRange TV?
 And then secondly, Brad, just a follow-up on your skinny basic comment, where you've seen some interest. I'm just wondering if you can elaborate, in terms of the take-up for skinny basic and unbundled channels or packages? Maybe what type of subscribers are coming into the market to take these kinds of offerings? Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [38]

Drew, Jay again. Yes, for sure. If you look at the marketplace, there's no question we can feel positive momentum in the marketplace. We continue to see already industry-leading customer satisfaction and likelihood to recommend to friends and family growing. And we hope to be able to report churn results on FreeRange TV as we go into our next quarter. Obviously, a little early with the mid-January launch

Want to reinforce, though, that the 360,000 devices that were activated by February 29 were a value add to our customers, who turned 360,000 smartphones in Western Canada into TVs. And this past week, as we made it available to laptops, we're turning our customers' laptops into TVs at no extra charge to consumers, which we think is going to have great medium-term financial results, both in terms of churn and also allow us the pricing power to do the things we would typically do with rate adjustments coming up this summer

So we're pleased with our momentum in the marketplace, and obviously wish we also could be able to show you numbers that are consistent with that, but happy with how -- the response we've been getting from our consumers. In terms of skinny basic, we've seen, as you would expect, a little flurry of activity right around -- we got out ahead of everybody else, which we think was good -- a little flurry of activity around all the press and all the talk, and it slowed down after that. Very much as expected, customers are taking limited TV, plus a couple of other packages, as you would expect, skewing a little bit more on the multicultural side, which we certainly saw, lots of value for consumers in it

A small number of customers have moved. They're saving a little bit of money. We're saving a little bit of network fees. In general terms, we think it's achieving the objectives that the commission had with what they're doing, and is certainly a plus for our customers and manageable for us

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [39]

Okay. That's great, Jay. And maybe a third one, if I can squeeze it in, maybe for you, Nancy. Just on ViaWest, obviously, you continued to perform quite well on an underlying basis. I guess across the data hosting space, there continues to be a lot of noise, there continues to be really mixed performance. And I'm just wondering if you could just characterize how the market is changing? Obviously, you're doing well, but just curious to know what exactly is changing out there, as you go quarter to quarter here?

Nancy Phillips,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO of ViaWest   [40]

Yes, obviously, we're very pleased, in terms of how we've done in terms of new customer acquisition. We're excited about the investments we've made over the last several months. We think those are really critical to how we think about infrastructure in the future. We've always been a Company that's been very much voice of the customer, and they've been telling us that as much as it's important to have a platform in our data center product, it's important to have a path forward, in terms of other platforms

And those include our cloud, our managed services, and now, with the AppliedTrust acquisition, certainly our professional services approach to high touch, high security applications. So what we're really seeing -- I think it's resonating tremendously -- is that we're filling a gap that many of the pure play companies in the industry have been challenged in trying to bring to market. So our hybrid multi-platform strategy is definitely resonating. We're seeing great upticks

And it's even resonating here in Canada. The Calgary operation has literally been open end of November, early December, and we're seeing tremendous take-down rates and feel very good about how we're progressing, as you mentioned, even in a tough Alberta market. We see our product resonating when there's certainly financial downturns. Companies are looking to outsource IT, and we fill the bill for those organizations. So I think it's the breadth of products we bring to the market. Clearly, we have a phenomenal customer service reputation in the industry, and I think the combination of the two is a winning formula

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [41]

That's great. Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [42]

The next question is from Aravinda Galappatthige of Canaccord Genuity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [43]

I'll start with a question on WIND. I was wondering, maybe for Alek, if you could maybe outline your strategy in Ontario? Apart from the LTE rollout, which will happen, I guess, in the next year or so, maybe just touch on where you're looking to drive changes? Whether it's investments in customer service, changes in pricing strategies, any sort of strategic changes that you can maybe disclose?

Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and President of WIND   [44]

Thank you for the question. Look, I think it's going to be a continuation of the strategy that we started about a year ago. And so along with improving the network, we want to make sure that we make some improvements in customer service. I think that there was a rigidity in the customer service approach that was originally there a year ago, and we started changing that. When it comes to pricing, I think you're going to continue to see us have a very disciplined approach to the market. We think that there is an implicit discount that we operate at, compared to some of the incumbent pricing, and that should continue

And at the end of the day, we're trying to just make sure that value equation for the customer is good, in terms of what they're getting and how much they're paying for it. And then most importantly, I think when all other things are equal, we want to be that Company that people look at and they say, look, we buy from people we like and trust. And so we really need to grab that higher ground. There's no secret that a lot of the customers in this country in wireless, they're not in love with the three incumbents, and we're like to -- I'd give them a reason to at least like us

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [45]

Great. Thanks for that. And just switching gears onto the cable side. On the consumer front, I think in the MD&amp;A, you've indicated some higher programming costs around annual rate renewals. I was wondering if you can provide a little bit of color on that? I was wondering whether there were any changes on the affiliate agreement side that may have ticked up the subscriber fees that you pay to the networks? Whether that played a role, as well, and whether that would potentially spill over to the following quarters, as well?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [46]

Yes, I think if you look at the network fee increases, you're just seeing the contracted increases that are on multi-year agreements, and we have one of our major providers who, as you can imagine one of which, too, who has a January 1 rate increase that's built into a multi-year deal. It's the final year of that deal. And so it's the normal increasing cost that was contracted

Certainly, as we look in the top TV world, and we look at affiliate agreements and we look at the new regime under the Commission's new rules, we think we're in a better position than ever to be able to negotiate for flexibility. We'll see, as that unfolds. As you can appreciate, the biggest programming pressure is sports, and we're going to do what we can to mitigate that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [47]

Great. Thank you. I'll leave it there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [48]

Next question is from Greg MacDonald of Macquarie

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [49]

The Alberta economy, there have been a couple of questions on it, but I'd like to ask a question this way. When you look back at the major impacts within your business that the economy -- the weakness in the economy is having, notwithstanding trying to make any forecast to what future job losses might be. Are you comfortable saying that there's stability now on the trend of the economic impact? Or is there still volatility there that represents risk?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [50]

Yes, stability's a challenging word. As we talked about on the last call, the economic conditions and what's happening, although it's different in various markets in Alberta and Saskatchewan, they're certainly real and visible to the naked eye. We think we've got good visibility, in terms of the changes in Fort McMurray, and we think the Fort McMurray economic changes are perhaps front-ended compared to some of the other economic changes. We're hopeful, in terms of trying to provide as much value to consumers

It's interesting, the flexibility that we have in our pricing, including limited TV and the new flexibility in packaging that's giving people landing places, as they try and find value when they're out of work and staying in the marketplace. So we're -- I really don't have a crystal ball beyond that. I can tell you that on a month-over-month basis, if you look at most recent results, we haven't seen a deterioration on a month-over-month basis. But to predict that into future months would be, I think, bolder than we'd be prepared to be at this moment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [51]

So Jay, maybe I can ask it in a different way. One of the risks of economic weakness is re-price, particularly on the business side of things, for your business customers. Do you think we've seen the worst of the ask for re-price type of trend that you would normally get in a weaker economy?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [52]

For Shaw, yes. When you think about the business space, the enterprise space is going to re-price, but we're not a big player in the enterprise space, and quite frankly, that re-price works in our favor. Lots of what you've seen is actually direct shutdown of oil and gas, where the operation is actually shut down. I think lots of that has happened on an immediate basis

And in the (inaudible) world, just the nature of it, you don't necessarily see repricing. And in fact, with all of our next generation services, we're well positioned there. So we think we're in good shape, in answer to your question on that. Others might still face challenges on the enterprise side

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [53]

Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And one quick one for Alek. Is it feasible that you could have LTE product in the market, and certainly in the Western markets, by Christmas?

Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and President of WIND   [54]

A lot of the answer to that question will be driven by the ecosystem that comes out of the handset manufacturers. We don't have visibility yet on exactly which handsets will be available, so difficult to say right now

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Capital Securities - Analyst   [55]

Okay

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [56]

Next question is from Maher Yaghi of Desjardins Capital Markets. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [57]

Thank you for taking my question. I have a follow-up question on your CapEx allocation on wireless, the CAD250 million for LTE. How about increasing the coverage of your current network to improve the coverage of your major cable operations in Western Canada? So basically, my question is, could we look at potentially increasing that amount of CAD250 million beyond the recurring CapEx in the next couple of years?

Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and President of WIND   [58]

Look, the CAD250 million that's been budgeted is to overlay LTE in all of the WIND territories. If I understand your question correctly, you're asking whether there could be a plan to build a broader network that would cover some incremental markets that Shaw serves with cable. And the answer is, we are going to definitely look at that, but again, we're very early. It's, as was said earlier, I think 45 days after close, so it's going to be a while before we can actually do some of that planning

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [59]

Okay, and how about your spectrum position? Are you comfortable? Or are you -- you never have enough spectrum, but to operate at a -- offer certain speeds and coverage that is comparable to the competition in Western Canada -- again, I focus on that area. Is there any need for additional spectrum in the next year or so?

Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and President of WIND   [60]

Look, there's an old rule of thumb that you'll never find a group of wireless operators that sat around one day over lunch and said, my god, we have too much spectrum. So we're always going to be hungry to find every kind of applicable spectrum and try to get our hands on it. I think we're very comfortable with the spectrum we've got that we can continue to operate this year. There is no question that a question of 600 megahertz is looming, and we want to make sure that the government is going to do the right things, in terms of making sure that they equalize the amount of low band spectrum that is available to all the new entrants

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [61]

If I look at, then, following onto these questions about capital allocations, and you have budgeted -- or gave some indications that the dividend is stable for this year, as you look more and more about your capital needs to build and operate a quality wireless network. And you look at your cash production, now that Media is sold, how do you regard your current dividend rate? And how sustainable it is in an environment where you need to potentially buy some additional spectrum, deploy larger areas of network and wireless, and continue to improve your cable operations? Could those be together -- put together enough free cash flow production to support your current dividend at the current rate?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CFO   [62]

I'm going to step in before Alek answers any dividend-related question. (laughter) But no, all kidding aside, great question, of course. And we've been pretty transparent to the market from this perspective. We clearly understand that over the next year or so, and through FY17, our payout factor's going to be well in excess of 100%, if you will, when you look at the cash dividend

Clearly, the (technical difficulty) assists us. There's a cost to that, from an equity perspective, but it effectively funds 30% of our dividend. So we're going to be really, really measured in that. We are in this for the long term, and all the repositioning that we have made clearly is about dividend growth going forward. And we'll obviously have an eye to that, as we move forward. And at the same time, we won't be shy in making the appropriate strategic investments for our Company, going forward, for the benefit of our shareholders longer-term

Keep in mind, we've obviously -- when you think about free cash flow, and we've got the Corus dividend that's also going to be there for us as we move forward, and we've got several other asset-related opportunities, as well, as we move forward. So no changes to long-term plans about a dividend growth Company, and taking a pause here over the next year or two

 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [63]

So -- yes, sorry. Go ahead. Sorry

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [64]

No problem. I just wanted to fill in your assumptions around the wireless space. That CAD250 million is the markets that we serve today, which includes increasing coverage in the market, and including increasing the number of sites in the market. You raise a point in terms of larger areas, areas that we don't currently serve today, but I wouldn't put too much of an overhang on that

Like if you look at the economics of rolling wireless in the [colonial], where we have 50 megahertz of spectrum and none of it used for 3G, or Vancouver Island, or Cranbrook, or Lethbridge, we've already got [trans-work] fiber into those communities, and we've got a heavy fiber network. When you think about the multi-year horizon, there's nothing in that capital investment that's scary, when you think about the Cranbrooks and the tuck-ins. Obviously, the success of our business will be in the GTA, it will be in the lower mainland, it will be in Calgary, it will be in Edmonton. It's where our CAD250 million is

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities - Analyst   [65]

That's very helpful. And just one last question on BNS. If the usual KPIs that we're looking at are not relevant anymore, in terms of -- or less relevant, in terms of subscriber numbers, could you provide some metrics that could be more useful to portray the current performance of the business? And how to forecast that business?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CFO   [66]

Yes, absolutely. I think ultimately, revenue's the bigger one. We frankly did contemplate whether we were going to pull RGUs, as far as our Q2s, but we wanted to give an opportunity to evaluate that. Your point is well noted, and it's an area of focus going forward. But I take you back just to the revenue line. At this point in time, we know EBITDA's lagging a little bit here, over the Q2, but we're -- we have confidence that the EBITDA line here will catch up to the revenue profile here over the next few quarters

 Our next question is from Rob Peters of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Peters,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [69]

Thank you very much for taking my question. Just maybe talking on FreeRange, and the success you've seen in terms of adoption so far. I was wondering, does that impact your time line for future integration of the X1 technology? And maybe what should we think about for the next major milestone on that deployment?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [70]

Hey, Rob. Jay again. Thank you. We're tremendously excited by -- as the Comcast team is, as well -- by the success of FreeRange. We think we've really hit the market with a unique go-to-market that is actually unique to Shaw, even on the X1 platform, and having great headway. We're excited to be already in market with our second launch. There's five or six different go-to-markets in our road map over the next 24 months

And I don't know that it provides us a lot of upside in sharing target dates and test market dates and launch plans from there, except to say that we couldn't be happier. We're greatly exceeding our predictions for FreeRange adoption, and we'll continue to invest heavily in regaining the video space

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Peters,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [71]

Perfect. Thank you very much. And maybe switching to the limited TV offering for a second. When we think about the limited TV -- and obviously, you've seen some people taking advantage of it to reduce their cost. But I was wondering, is there a situation you could see happening in the future, depending on how the economy goes, where you may see people who are currently on your lower tiers switching to that to pick up additional channels, to go to a more choice environment? Or do you really see it more as a cost saving tool?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc - President   [72]

Yes, we think the way limited TV has been packaged -- and we're packaged, I think, in a more friendly way than some others -- we think it adds choice to our consumers. And certainly what we've seen so far is, we've seen consumers move to limited TV that maybe the current packaging wasn't the right mouse trap to serve them. So whereas in the past, Shaw has included, as a competitive differentiator, sports on personal and basic TV, we're seeing limited TV appeal to customers who are choosing not to take sports

We're seeing a skew to multicultural and third language programming, which is a customer who used to have to take 50 or 60 channels of English language programming before they could subscribe to programming services in their language of choice. And we've seen a number of those customers adjust. We've seen some take-up of shomi from customers. That's one of our highest subscribed add-ons to limited TV, is shomi. So in some ways, it's complementary to the package that we have, giving more choice to consumers and filling in some gaps that our previous packaging didn't quite meet the needs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Peters,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [73]

Perfect. That's fantastic color, thank you. Maybe one last question, if I could squeeze it in. In terms of the participation and the DRIP of the Corus shares, I just wanted to clarify. I believe that ends in August 2017, but I also know that it expires as the lockup expires. So how should we think about when those shares would be eligible for dividends?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CFO   [74]

Yes, so the first third actually expire in April, a year from now, and then the complete expiry of the whole thing is at the end of August. So it's a staged

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [75]

So the DRIP is consistent with the hold on the shares

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CFO   [76]

Correct, but then the DRIP commitment is over at the end of August 31, 2017

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Peters,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [77]

So the DRIP commitment is ahead of the lockup expiry, that's correct?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CFO   [78]

Right, for the lockup for the first third, we DRIP the whole thing for the first year. And then after that, one-third comes off immediately, and then the rest comes off in August 31, 2017

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Peters,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [79]

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

We will now begin the question-and-answer session

(Operator Instructions)
 Jeff Fan, Scotiabank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [2]

I have got a few. Let's start off with the consumer Internet subscribers being down about 8,000. Wondering if you can just help us break that down into some of the impact related to the fire, consumer and maybe the competitive impact? Maybe we will start there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO   [3]

Hey, Jeff. It's Jay. Thanks for the question. The Internet subscriber results in consumer, which to be clear, nobody is happy with, I think are largely a continuation of the trend that we've had for the last four quarters when you net from Fort McMurray University students. So if you think back over the last number of quarters before was 265, a small net gain

Q1, we added the university students, up to 9,400, and then Q2 was a small gain of 4,300 so when you look at the numbers, there's 2,000 temporary disconnects in Fort McMurray in it, along with university students. What you can't see in the number is increasingly, as Vito mentioned, we have a growing single play Internet base, with some churn in single play that is driven partially by university students and partially by other factors in the market

And you've seen that we're changing some of our approaches with the two-year value plan and WideOpen and on our go-forward basis to add value to those customers. That's a little bit of extra data for you, Jeff. Let's be clear, though, taken together, these Internet subscriber results are not acceptable for what we see in the future of our business. Our big growth opportunities, as you know, are absolutely wireless and absolutely ultra broadband, and we're going to change to -- we're going to choose to behave differently in the marketplace going forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [4]

Okay. Thanks, Jay. Maybe quickly, turning over to Wireless, just son the accounting, on related to handset subsidies, can you help us quantify the -- how much that was capitalized? I know the number is not a big amount but it just helps us, for comparison with the other wireless guys and also versus our numbers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [5]

Hi Jeff, our VP of Control is very excited that we're getting an accounting question here on our call. Thank you for asking the question. Obviously, it's the first time we're reporting Wireless. When we -- you're absolutely right. Revenue from equipment is recognized when the equipment is delevered -- delivered and accepted by either our subscribers or our dealers

That is a bit different than where the -- I believe the legacy or the incumbents are at. When you look at the receivables, so what happens obviously is at the time we sell it, we recognize the revenue and then we capitalize the subsidy and amortize that subsidy over the 24 months or whatever the term of the respective contract is

The amount of the receivable at the end of May is in the amount of approximately CAD62 million for the quarter so that gives you an idea of what the tab subsidy is. If you're trying to determine what -- it was our EBITDA results versus our cash EBITDA perhaps for the quarter, I'd give you a number that would be closer to a CAD3 million adjustment. So our cash EBITDA would have been CAD3 million lower than perhaps reported. Hope that helps provide some context

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [6]

Okay. That's helpful. And just maybe lastly, a question for Nancy. In the data center business and just the Infrastructure, or the Service market, it seems like there's tremendous demand that's going on, driven by various players including the enterprise but as well as other cloud providers

Nancy, I was just wondering if you can talk a little bit about what's going on in the market, whether the demand is sustainable, whether that's pulling forward some of the demand from the future. Just can you give us a sense of what's going on in the market and how sustainable the growth is for you?

Nancy Phillips,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO of ViaWest   [7]

Yes. Morning, Jeff. We just continue to see very strong demand across the entire portfolio of products that we're offering. I think it wasn't that long ago that many felt colocation may be a product set that might see a slowing. We don't see that

We don't see amongst our peers; we don't see clearly in our pipeline and demand cycles. But on top of that, clearly I think ViaWest has worked hard to distinguish itself in the market, in terms of a multi-platform strategy

And so we see increasingly, not only a demand for our colocation products, which remain very strong but also in terms of our private cloud capabilities, where we do see new demand attributes is definitely around the security services and deeply managed capabilities, which I think we did a good job last year of acquiring the AppliedTrust asset to add that into our portfolio and we see good demand profile there

So I don't see and certainly what I would say in terms of the public peers down in the markets here, we all are seeing continued strong demand for our capabilities. Certainly, some of them with more of a colocation bend but overall, just continue to see good growth and don't anticipate or don't see anything that is slowing that as we enter FY17

Vince Valentini, TD Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [9]

Jay, I think where you may be alluding to with changing your behavior in Internet, we may have seen some first example of that this morning with your new Internet 150 product for CAD49.90 for the first 12 months. Can you comment a bit about that? It seems awfully aggressive versus what you were charging for slower speed services before and what Telus charges for, say, 50 Megabit service. Is this a sign of things to come as Shaw feels you really need to push on the price pedal to reaccelerate your subscriber growth in Internet?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO   [10]

Thanks, Vince. I appreciate the question. I wouldn't look at this within the context of Internet subscriber results in the last quarter or two, as much as the realization of our strategy that we've talked about for a number of quarters around the growth engines of Shaw being wireless and ultra broadband

As you know, there is a DOCSIS advantage that the cable companies have and we focused our investments in getting ready. The advantage that we have is we don't have bad neighborhoods. We have everybody lives in a good neighborhood and we have the opportunity to bring value to consumers with speeds that they haven't been able to enjoy in the price -- in the past at prices they can afford

We have been working on this for many years and I know the team here at Shaw is quite excited to be able to grow the DOCSIS cable advantage to our consumers. Let me give you a look and you can have a look at the website as we launch it today. If you look at the pricing and packaging, I think the team has done a terrific job of managing the balance of providing value for consumers

And if you look at where our price points are coming from, we're still talking about an CAD80 Internet product. And I know you talk about the first 12 months on the -- on a value agreement but we're pretty excited about how this is going forward. And we have a window of time where cable has a broadband advantage and we think Western Canadians should enjoy it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [11]

But Jay, we talked many times in the past about the battle between yourselves and Telus and you -- right now, or Telus has been at around three-month promotional pricing and it always seems like an undisciplined move to move to 12 months and any other guy will inevitably follow. So it seems that you're making the first move here. Why wasn't the CAD49.90 just at three-months promotion as opposed to a full 12 months?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO   [12]

I guess there's two ways to look at that, Vince. The other way to look at it is really introducing a two-year value plan and a contract for Internet customers which is I think a major step forward in terms of discipline. And I think if you look at the blended rate over the two years, it's either still highly, highly profitable customers compared to the previous three-month offers that we've had in the past

Remember when you talk about this CAD80 product, it's only a few years ago that we had a CAD35 ARPU in Internet. We've got very few customers paying us CAD80 today. The CAD73 price point is the last big price point that we have consumers in. In a world of -- if you do the math despite how it looks initially, if you do the math, I think you're going to really like it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [13]

Okay, great. If I could just clarify a couple of CapEx things, Vito. You said the 2017 guidance includes the CAD250 million LTE but just to clarify, you don't mean an entire CAD250 million? You're just saying that plan, whatever portion of your spending on that plan is included within the CAD1.3 billion for next year?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [14]

That's correct. Thanks for the clarification, Vince. It includes the completion of our LTE program

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [15]

In this quarter, the CAD51 million you spent, the wording in the MD&amp;A says they're spending on LTE readiness. Does that imply that there's no actual hard construction yet in the Q3 figure and that probably starts in Q4 and you're basically just network planning at this point?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [16]

Yes. That is correct and maybe I'm not sure if Alek wants to provide any additional color from a network perspective in Q3, but that's correct from an LTE perspective. Alek, do want to go?

Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and President, WIND   [17]

Sure. The -- look, the bulk of that was regular CapEx, some finishing of the Q3 swap-out. There is some early work being done beyond just planning but it's really early stage on the LTE stuff

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [18]

Phillip Huang, Barclays

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [19]

Certainly, we agree with you that the big growth opportunity is in wireless in the long-term. My question is once you've completed the LTE upgrade, can you maybe give us a sense of what level of growth do you expect WIND to be able to achieve?
 And also beyond the LTE upgrade, maybe if you could give us a sense of what else we need to do to accelerate growth, whether it be spectrum, towers, and directionally, the time on that you see that happening? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO   [20]

Great. Alek, we'll let you start it off

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and President, WIND   [21]

Thanks, Jay. Look, folks. I think that what you're seeing here is moderate growth in wireless when you take that into -- take into account the fact that we're still operating just with a 3G product with a network that still needs some upgrading

I think the growth that we're seeing actually is part of our walk before we run strategy. The flanker brand that we compete against continue to have an advantage, both in terms of some of the handsets they have and also in terms of the fact that they have an advantage over our 3G network

My big indicator is, are we getting our fair share of gross adds? And I believe that given some of the constraints the businesses had up until now, we are definitely getting our fair share of gross adds. I think what happens is once LTE launches next year, we have an opportunity to grab a better percentage of those gross adds

By then, a lot of things have been fixed. You will continue to see our churn rate drop and then you actually start to see growth that I think is more commensurate with what this opportunity really represents

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [22]

As part of that strategy, after the LTE upgrade, at what point do you envision the need to add some low band spectrum and how do you feel about the number of cell sites you currently have given the spectrum portfolio that you currently hold?

Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and President, WIND   [23]

I think the way we've designed the network given the spectrum we had in the past and currently have I think is working as well as it possibly can. The recent 3G upgrades, where we swapped out the old 3G equipment in Vancouver, Calgary, and Edmonton

And then turned on the extra spectrum that we got in that Rogers-Mobilicity Shaw deal last summer has had a profound impact on the performance customers are experiencing. And it is essentially a 50% increase in data throughput and we're seeing that anecdotally in some of the bloggers are saying but we're seeing it with some real solid numbers in terms of lower churn rates

So I'm not uncomfortable at all with the number of cell sites we have for the area we're trying to cover. I think the priority to get low band spectrum is not lost on us and it sure as heck isn't lost on the folks in Ottawa

Part of having a sustainable fourth player option is making sure that the offering from that fourth player comes as close to being the same as what the three incumbents have and it's pretty hard to do that in terms of in-building penetration without low band spectrum. So we are cautiously optimistic that low band spectrum will be part of our tool bag in the future

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [24]

Right, right. So I guess just to clarify, beyond the LTE upgrade for, say, you have X amount of dollars to spend on wireless budgeted. What would you prioritize first? Spectrum or cell site building or distribution? Like, what would it be that you think is going to give you the most bang for buck in terms of accelerating growth in the business?

Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and President, WIND   [25]

Look, I think first and foremost is monetizing and realizing the benefit of the spectrum we currently own. So we own 30 Megahertz of AWS-3 and it shouldn't be lost on anybody that -- how big a chunk of spectrum that is to be all turned on for one technology, specifically LTE

So very clearly, that's our priority. I think that next would be to get low band spectrum and then the list is long beyond that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [26]

Right, got it. And then finally, I have a quick follow-up on the CAD51 million impairment to shomi, I was wondering what that -- what's the reason behind that? Like, what's causing the impairments to have to be made? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [27]

Yes, the CAD50 million -- Thanks. It's Vito here. I mean, at the end of the day, the CAD51 million write-down represents the cash contribution to the shomi joint venture in excess of what we have today to expense in our P&amp;L by our equity accounting methodology. I'd add that our investment in shomi was more directly anchored to our media business and coincident with the sale of our Shaw Media to Corus, which as you are aware, was closed and recorded in our Q3 financials

We evaluated our investment in shomi on a more, I'll call it, standalone basis and accordingly, we believe it was a more appropriate for us to write down the carrying value of the investment to nil. It doesn't say anything more about our future prospects at this point in time with regards to the shomi joint venture in any way, shape or form. It's an accounting write down

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [28]

The timing in that is relation to the Shaw Media sale to Corus; is that the reason why we're seeing it now?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [29]

Yes, I -- absolutely. I think it's -- as I said, it links back to our strategy, more of a media strategy for us a bit and it was an appropriate time for us to -- on a quarterly basis, we always look at the carrying value of our investments and we thought this was the time for us

Operator   [30]

Drew McReynolds, RBC Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [31]

Vito, just a clarification, just back to the wireless accounting. It -- just from your MD&amp;A, it looks as if when you start to amortize that handset subsidy in the P&amp;L, are you netting that against revenue or do we still see revenue and then that amortization hits an OpEx number? Can you just clarify that?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [32]

Yes, the former. We are netting that amortization against revenue

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [33]

Okay, and just curious. Obviously, that's different than either Manitoba WIND incumbents. Just wondering what your rationale overall is for doing something that I think is a little bit unique in the -- on this front?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [34]

Yes. I think two primary drivers. One, first of all, this is how WIND has been accounting for it historically. But I think the primary reasons is, when we look at where IFRS is going, frankly, and from a revenue recognition perspective, I don't want to be speaking for the incumbents in the marketplace, I think the way this is accounting for it is probably the way things are leading going forward and recording your revenue effectively on a sale basis

The second piece that's very important that might be different from where the incumbents are at, is we have two contracts. We have a contract for the sale of the equipment and then we have a contract for the sale of service, where I believe for the most part, the industry has one embedded contract on the two. So that makes us very comfortable with our accounting

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [35]

Okay got you. Great. Just two others for me. Also for you, Vito. Just -- I haven't had time to go through this, but in terms of your FY16 EBITDA growth guidance, can you just let us know what the FY15 EBITDA number is that, that's based off?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [36]

You know what? Let me come back to you on that one. We'll dig that up. I'm not sure I have that on my fingertips here

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [37]

Okay, okay. No, that would be great. And then lastly, on the CapEx guidance versus our numbers, bumped up a little bit in FY16 and in FY17. I know you're not going to give guidance for 2018 but directionally, obviously post the LTE upgrade. Are we to expect a sequential downtick? In other words, have you brought a lot of stuff forward given all the technology deployments in LTE in FY17? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO   [38]

Sure, Drew. It's Jay. I'll first tune then Vito may want to add. For sure. When you look at FY16, I think when we reconcile our numbers to what you guys have it, to be clear, the incremental capital is from the wireline side, not on the wireless side and it's driven by two things

One, it's driven by our commitment to the two-year value plan that we launched March 1. What that means for customer premise equipment. For five years, we've competed in a marketplace with a competitor whose customers are primarily on contract in a asymmetrical basis where we are primarily on month-to-month

And we are making the adjustment to move to the two-year value plan, as you saw with WideOpen today, as a continuation of that strategy and then you've also seen some additional network investment, not in support of the launch of 150, but to make sure that we're in a position to respond to any competitive developments that happen going forward and being able to increase that

When you look at FY17, the wireline expenditure group is similar to FY16 so the incremental number there is just the extra six months of wireless, as you see. Just to be clear, FY17 capital which we wanted to share with people because it's been a topic of much discussion, it includes completing the LTE build everywhere; it includes completing DOCSIS 3.1 everywhere; and it includes the X1 set-top box roll-out everywhere. So I think with the completion of those major projects, you can pretty easily do the math on what the spending would be FY18

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [39]

Okay, thanks for that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [40]

I'll just jump in on your previous question regards to the 2015 base that our EBITDA guidance is predicated on. I will give you the three numbers from a business unit perspective. The consumer number, CAD1.686 billion; the BNS number is CAD256 million; and the BIS number, CAD95 million, which obviously is very consistent with what we've reported as far as our FY15 numbers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [41]

Tim Casey, BMO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [42]

Just wanted to talk a little bit about the X1 rollout. In the past, Jay, you've talked about how that would be an incremental rollout rather than a forklift rollout. I'm just -- you've said that the X1 box will be available across the network but I'm assuming you're going to be incenting your best customers to upgrade. I'm just wondering how we should think about the penetration going forward of X1 directionally speaking?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [43]

Sure. Thanks Tim. I would say a couple things were about X1 and one of our next generation video roll-out generally. We're very happy with the results on FreeRange TV and the first deliverable, which has already taken our most valuable customers and lowered their already lowered churn beyond that. So step one has clearly worked

We're doing a market-by-market rollout in FY17 of the set-top and reminding everybody that we're joining the Comcast roadmap as a moving train. So we will be launching the services that are available today, not the services they started with, along with the bolt-ons from [Ottawa], and all the tremendous technology and innovations that our partners are going

I'm not sure I have a lot to add in terms of penetration numbers; that would be speculative. I could give you some economics that we haven't necessarily shared in the past, as everything is becoming clear to us. The total next generation video, if you look at our FY16 numbers have a CAD75 million impact and that is not payment to Comcast; that's all of our next generation video cost

In FY16 that is two-thirds capital and one-third OpEx. I think if look at FY17, it's a similar total number in and around the same total cash number but it shifts to one-third capital and two-thirds OpEx. So it might help you work through some of the costs as we think about going forward

 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [44]

That's great. Thanks a lot. Just a clarification. You mentioned, Vito, you mentioned, there was CAD14 million worth of dividends from Corus. I thought you were taking that on a DRIP so is that a cash number or --?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [45]

We are. You are absolutely right Tim. We are taking it on a DRIP. We are including it in our free cash flow calculation and we're very explicit about that. I think when we look back to, obviously, the sale of the media results and what they've contributed, I think we feel comfortable but obviously the reader and analysts can make any adjustments they see fit. But we do see it as part of our go-forward free cash flow profile

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [46]

So just to be clear, it's a -- you're not receiving cash, but you're including it in your free cash flow definition?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [47]

That is correct

 Aravinda Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [49]

Just to get back to wireless for a second. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about your plans on the distribution side? Obviously, a key for a wireless business anywhere. I was wondering what your plans are over the next 12 months, and the expanded distribution in the West and related to that, how far away is the plans around bundling with the Shaw wireline products?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO   [50]

Again, Alek if you could start

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and President, WIND   [51]

Sure, Jay. Thank you. Well, look, in terms of the overall distribution strategy, I think when we took over, when our -- the current management team here took over WIND a year or plus ago before the Shaw folks bought WIND, I would have characterized our distribution as probably too narrow

Traditionally, in wireless, you want to have a multi-channel distribution strategy. You want to have a bunch of corporate stores. You supplement those with a series of independent dealers, that, in a perfect world, look and smell and act like a corporate store. You shouldn't be able to tell the difference based on who owns it

You generally would have some national third-party retail and then some unique relationships that help drive distribution. We would be characterized as only having had the first two channels of distribution. We brought some new folks into management that are now helping develop the strategy on how we're going to expand into other channels of distribution. I'm not going to reveal much more than that right now

The -- as it relates to your question in terms of the Shaw bundling approach, I think there is no question that bundling is something that works and helps accelerate the growth curve on subscribers. I think that the right time to put the Shaw brand on a wireless product is when there is no reason to ever apologize for anything and that is post an LTE launch and I think that distribution flows from that as well

So I think that the types of distribution channels we'll have in the East will vary from what we'll have in the West based on having WIND mobile stores as well as Shaw stores selling a wireless product. That was the end of my answer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [52]

(laughter) Thanks for that. Just a housekeeping question, with respect to the WIND margins. Obviously, it surprised us to the upside in Q3. I was wondering, is it possible for you to provide us with a year-to-date margin for WIND and also, if possible, the adjustment as you noted for the subsidy?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [53]

I think we're stay away from any year-to-date numbers, and as I said, I don't know that I'd call it an adjustment for the subsidy because that's effectively what we're -- the way we're counting for it going forward and you need to be cognizant of the year-over-year comparisons. But I would -- I'd characterize it to say, if you're looking to reconcile what component of the subsidy versus -- is making its way into the Q3 results I'd bring you back to the CAD2 million, CAD3 million adjustment related to maturity but versus cash EBITDA

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [54]

Just building on your comments about EBITDA and wireless, we want to be clear that while we were pleased with the wireless EBITDA results in Q3, the game we're not playing is one that optimizes EBITDA in the short to medium term. This is a growth asset and we are focused on growth and Alek talked to you about some of the sequencing as we drive the growth but this isn't EBITDA optimization asset; this is a growth asset

Greg MacDonald, Macquarie

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [56]

Looking at wireless subscriber, as I think the numbers around 25,000. Based on the gross number that was given, CAD36, a little over CAD36 in ARPU; sometimes it's helpful for us to understand trends by looking at the same metrics on a gross add basis. I am referring to ARPU. Is the ARPU different on a gross add basis on the CAD36, i.e., the customers that were sold in this quarter? Are those customers coming in at a different presumably higher ARPU than the CAD36? And is the post-paid, prepaid mix different than what the absolute is right now on most recent gross adds?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO   [57]

Go ahead, Alek

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and President, WIND   [58]

Sorry guys. I had the mute button on there. Look, as far as ARPU, I think that given the market conditions with where the flankers have been with a slightly better product, I think the ARPU growth that we have experienced has actually been what we have expected

We have not been focused on trying to drop price and accelerate sales beyond what was a natural rate of growth that's in the market right now. Again, this is part of the walk before we run. We want to make sure we get all of our house in order in terms of network before we push hard on the accelerator

Now it should be clear to everybody though, that our strategy is not to maximize EBITDA over growth; very clearly, this is a growth engine and we definitely want to grow. The long-term plan is to ensure that all of the new gross adds that we put on the network, put on the base are really at an ARPU level that starts with a CAD40 because we have to end up at an ARPU level that is in the CAD40s as quickly as we can

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [59]

So presumably, Alek, that would be talking post-LTE, right? Or are you adding growth -- or are a majority of your gross adds today over CAD40?

Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and President, WIND   [60]

They are right around the CAD40 mark. This is an internal discussion that we have quite a bit here with Glen Campbell, and Bruce Kirby and others. I want to keep pushing back on any rate plans that aren't going to get us there

Now what we do -- there's always going to be some rate plans that are below CAD40. I think the key is, how do you incent the folks at the distribution -- in the distribution channels to ensure that we do everything possible to continue to upsell and get people into the CAD40s because it's no question that's our objective

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [61]

Okay, that's helpful

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [62]

Greg, I'll just chime in there. I think understand the nature of your question, obviously, as far as, hey, what's happening underneath that next level between post-paid and pre-paids? I'd just characterize it as what you're seeing on an overall basis from an ARPU perspective of year-over-year growth of 3.6%

When you get into the post-paid, you're seeing something very similar with the post-paids are coming in at a healthy clip, balancing, of course, what Alek has mentioned which is a long-term gain for us versus, obviously, the EBITDA results

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [63]

Okay, that's helpful. Are you guys prepared to share the churn number right now?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [64]

Not at this point. No. Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [65]

Okay. Have you indicated when you're planning on disclosing more traditional metrics? Is that -- I don't -- I actually don't know if I -- if you ever commented on that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [66]

We continue to obviously evolve our disclosure on wireless. We think we're -- it's important that we give obviously a fair degree of visibility from a reader perspective and analysts in the financial community. For the time being, Greg, I think we're comfortable with what we're doing and we'll continue to evolve as we move forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [67]

Okay, that's helpful. One last question, guys. It's more of a broad strategic-type question. You talked about in the past, well, after the WIND transaction, optionality on asset sales. You talked about real estate; you talked about certain cable assets perhaps that don't fit the core Western market and opportunities to raise, I don't know, in the hundreds, call it, CAD300 million or CAD400 million

A, is that under consideration and then, B, if you talk -- if you think about larger situations, well, obviously, a big topic of discussion in the market right now is whether the Ontario wireless assets within WIND are strategically important to the Company to the extent there's value obviously, they are strategically important

How important is a wireless asset that overlays with a wireline asset to you? Is that something that's strategically imperative in the future? That doesn't necessarily mean you sell this asset; it just could mean that you need to leverage this asset with other wireline players. How do you think about that?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [68]

Greg, maybe I will start off. There's a lot there your question and then maybe flip it over to Jay. As far as short-term assets, real estate, we're always looking at obviously maximizing value from a balance sheet perspective and shareholder. We really like our portfolio and what we have

And when you look at our balance sheet and you heard me refer to some of this commentary in my script, there's -- we really like our balance sheet, committed in investment grade; obviously, committed to dividend, dividend growth going forward at the right time. We don't have any financings here for the balance of this year and as we look at our maturity here, FY17, we've got CAD400 million

So things are really, really in a nice spot for us from an overall leverage financing need perspective. Having said that, we are always looking to optimize but I would say for the first part of your question, whether you're talking real estate or items like that, I would say it's on the margin and I wouldn't say that there's anything material that we're going to announce in that regard anytime soon. Second part, maybe over to Jay

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO   [69]

If I heard you correctly terms of the question about, I think we all see the opportunity for the converged network in Western Canada and what that makes possible for consumers. We are pretty excited about the opportunity that exists in Ontario to offer a differentiated Internet product. We don't think consumers in Ontario need another CAD80 Internet product or wireless products that is exactly the same as what the big three are offering

We think there's lots of room for a single challenger fighter brand to come to the market with the unique value proposition that is made possible by our sustainable cost advantage that Alek is bringing. So we're excited about the value that the Ontario wireless market is going to bring to the overall asset

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [70]

So just to be clear, Jay when you're talking sustainable cost opportunity, bringing that to the market, I've spoken a lot in the past about that advantage you have in spectrum but do you think you need to do something with a wire, let's call it, a cable company in Ontario to be able to mutually leverage that opportunity and maintain that competitive advantage you have?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - COO   [71]

No, we don't think that we do. That having been said, we're a Company that's open to conversations

Maher Yaghi, Desjardins Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Capital Markets - Analyst   [73]

I would like to take another go at your new Internet product launch and look at it in terms of what is expected impact on long-term ROIC. I think many people would look at the pricing strategy maybe negatively but to be fair, your CapEx is a lot less for you to offer 1 Gig eventually on DOCSIS 3.1 than the typical telco

So I would like to look at wireline product on a total ROIC basis and not just on an EBITDA margin basis. So could you look at -- could you provide your view on how your forecasted ROIC returns? It looks like right now, on your wireline product, as you look for over the next five years compares to your historical ROIC patterns?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [74]

Yes. There is a lot there as well. I mean, I think --

Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Capital Markets - Analyst   [75]

I have another question after

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [76]

(laughter) I think you hit the nail on the head a little bit and as we make these strategic investments, we really, really like our competitive advantage and what you've described. You have seen us up a little bit of our capital guidance here, not only to include wireless but also to lean in a little bit as we're never going to let our network advantage fall off and prepare to invest as we move forward, not only for this year but in the years ahead

Clearly, we see broadband and leveraging fiber deeper. So the return on investment is very, very attractive. It is all embedded in whether your market share assumptions, whether your growth assumptions. So I'm going to stay away from any specific ranges of numbers

But clearly, as we make these investments, and as we launch these products, you've heard Jay refer earlier to the overall ARPU sort of developments here as we move forward over the next three to four years. ROIC, along with providing value, and having an appropriate longer-term view is at the heart of everything that we're measuring

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Capital Markets - Analyst   [77]

So as you look at it at this point in time, your historical strong high ROIC, you don't see any -- you don't see risks and jeopardizing that with the new product pricing that you're launching in the market?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [78]

Well, and is again, it is inherent in our assumptions around a churn and retention and you see us moving towards value plans and stickiness of customers, obviously. But that is at the core of our strategic discussions and we are confident in the plans we have put forth

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Capital Markets - Analyst   [79]

Okay. The second question I have is on the wireless. I think a lot of people agree on the potential growth of that product and how it can help your business. But I think it's no secret that a lot of people as well are concerned that it can consume a lot of capital to be deployed

You talked about your 2017 CapEx guidance which doesn't look like you need any external equity financing. But can you -- when you look at it from a holistic point of view and you include the spectrum acquisition potentially that you need to make, you talked about earlier that you'd like to have more spectrum, et cetera. Are you, as a Company, when you look at it at this point in time, can fully finance this investment and be a number -- top three type player in the market in wireless without having to endure potentially costly financings?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [80]

Yes, we -- 100%. I think we love our five-year plan here as we look forward. Clearly, spectrum, you referred to it there's -- that's a bit of the -- I will call it the wild card and what that looks like as we move forward. But under a range of options in scenarios there, we feel very, very comfortable that the position that we're in and our shareholders are in as we move forward is on solid footing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Peters,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [82]

Maybe just for Nancy, when we look at the ViaWest margins, sequentially, we saw some improvement in the quarter. I'm just wondering if you can give any color on any of the outstanding investments needed to grow the business? And if we're seeing a trough quarter in Q2? I was also curious if you could provide an update to where you think the margin could go over time and what time frame we might see that achieved?

Nancy Phillips,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO of ViaWest   [83]

The margins remain consistent with our historical results. What I would say is that we -- as Vito started, we are in the process of just churning up another large center in the Texas market in Plano and feel very good about actually the capacity that we do have going into 2017. We're well-positioned not only on our colocation but also in terms of our cloud and managed capabilities

We do have some augmentations going on but what I would say is that, clearly there is, I think the margins have been very consistent and what I would say is, I mean, there's some noise quarter to quarter but overall, they are very consistent. I think that we feel sitting in that high 30%s to 40% to 41% range is very consistent with our historical performance and I feel very strongly that, that will continue

Clearly, there is a longer-term view in terms of the richness of the managed services platform that we are bringing to bear. That will have some contribution because it is -- it tends to be a more professional services-based capability in the business but I think the nice mix of infrastructure services, along with our managed capability. I'm not anticipating much change in terms of our margin profile

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Peters,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [84]

Perfect. Thank you very much. If I could squeeze one brief one in for Vito. Just on the dividend from Corus included in free cash flow, can you just refresh us in terms of when the -- when it converts from a DRIP to the actual cash dividends?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [85]

August 17 is when that flips over

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Peters,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [86]

Perfect. Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Corporate Development and Business Planning   [87]

Maybe I will just add, Rob. I think it's important over the long-term when you look at payout ratios and things, that, that's why we are including the dividend in the calculation. It is roughly CAD80 million and yes, we're not receiving the cash today. Under the agreement we do have the ability to monetize those DRIP dividends we're receiving. That is not our current plan

But we think it's important that investors in the Street understand that, that is an CAD80 million a year cash flow that we have the ability to get today. If we wanted to sale those shares, that's not to say that we're going to and then in a year's time, for -- on a long-term basis, that we have that ability to go off the DRIP in August 31

 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [88]

Great additional color, Trevor. Thank you

 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [2]

Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. First, I will start off with the consumer margins. This quarter was a little bit weak and, as you guys pointed out, I think there were a couple of cost items

Wondering how you see consumer margins going into 2017 because there was a lot of moving parts with, obviously, price increases putting through, you've got the WideOpen 150 new customers coming in, you have X1 costs and then you have cost savings and programming. Wondering how all of that sort of flows through at the end of the day to consumer margins in 2017?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [3]

Jeff, maybe I will start off and, Jay, you can cleanup for me if I missed anything. Clearly as we head into -- a consumer component is a key part of our, obviously, consolidated FY17 guidance and when you look at the margin activity, clearly a year of it, continued investment for us, content costs and NGV costs, in particular, will weigh heavily into our cost base as we move forward

The business is doing all they can, obviously, from an operational effectiveness perspective and efficiency perspective. But overall, when you look at the cost picture plus the focus, really, on subscriber and revenue growth, I would say that you can anticipate some pressure on the consumer margins as we move into FY17

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [4]

Okay. And then the second part of the question or second question really is around your wireless strategy. There is a couple of different approaches. One, if you look at what T-Mobile, with their uncarrier approach in the US, is doing that is certainly one approach

Another approach could be, you could be looking at it as an extension of your cable services into wireless, in which the benefit could come from lower churn of the core business as well as increase in value of the wireless business. Wondering how you can -- how you look at it as you get the upgrade under your belts going through 2017

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alek Krstajic,  WIND - EVP and President   [5]

Hi, Jeff. Alek Krstajic here. We see the Canadian market a little bit different than the US market and I don't think that there is a need to do quite as aggressive an approach as what T-Mobile did down in the States with the uncarrier approach

You are not going to see me growing my hair long and wearing a pink T-shirt and crashing competitors' parties. But in the same way, I don't think there is a need to be as disruptive. We are having a great growth already with the 3G market over the 3G network and I think you will see that kind of thing continue in a much more stable approach to how we attack the market

 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [6]

Vince Valentini, TD Securities

 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [8]

Thanks very much. Sticking with the consumer margins from a slightly given angle, you are getting more customers signing up for these two-year value plans

So obviously in year one they get a pretty good discount on their price but then they jump up. Is that something you would expect to see a good snap back in your margins in 2018 if you keep loading a lot of customers on two-year deals?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP   [9]

Thanks, Vince. It is Jay. You have correctly identified one of the major shifts in the marketplace. And to be clear, we moved kind of aggressively on two-year value plans on the first of March and amplified that with the launch of WideOpen in July

The benefits of that, in terms of creating symmetrical competition with our primary competitor, you will recall for the last number of years we have been asymmetrical where a large proportion of their base and almost all of their ads were on a contract and ours were on a month-to-month basis. So some costs and some discounting at the front end

I can tell you, having already seen the results from October of the original March six months roll off, we are seeing the churn benefits that we anticipated from that. Over 90% of our WideOpen Internet 150 at launch ads went into a two-year value plan and so the churn and margin benefits, I think, are easy to model from there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [10]

Okay. Great. And while I have got you, Jay, X1, can you just clarify this for me. So is there going to be some sort of launch, by say your second quarter of FY17 or are we talking about a delay until next summer before any of your customers can start to see the full boxes and platform?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP   [11]

Vince, you have heard our full voice around WideOpen Internet 150. Please don't read into that, that we're under emphasizing any of the three elements. You'll recall as we talked about the CAD1.2 billion in capital last year and the CAD1.3 billion this year that, that was to complete the ultra broadband upgrades, DOCSIS 3.1 in all markets, X1 in all markets and the LTE build in all major markets and actually most minor markets

All three of those programs are on track and on budget and we are equally committed to all of them. I think you have seen some sequencing. X1 is certainly on time and on budget and we could not be more delighted with our progress

We're in full trial now and initial results installed in homes have been extremely positive for sure. We will go outside of the trial and into installing into customers homes in this calendar year

When you talk about the go-to-market launch, I am not sure how you will measure our approach but we will be in the open market in at least one market in calendar 2016. It is a big part of our FY17 plan

 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [14]

Thanks. Good afternoon. I have a question on the wireless net adds this quarter. Certainly appears that the market is responding positively to your network upgrade

I was wondering if you could provide a bit of color on where you are seeing the most significant change, if at all, in your wireless subscriber growth momentum. Is it more Western Canada given that is where you started the 3G equipment upgrade and then now LTE-Advanced or is it also more Ontario still?

Alek Krstajic,  WIND - EVP and President   [15]

Hi. This is Alek Krstajic. In absolute terms, the numbers are still -- the majority are coming out of Ontario. If you actually looked at the growth rate, there is a slightly higher growth rate in the West and that you would expect given the network upgrades by changing out some of the 3G equipment, turning on the extra spectrum we had

It had a pretty profound impact on the performance of the network out West and I think with some of this growth you are seeing, it is clearly showing that there is a correlation between better network performance and more growth. But for sure, the majority of the subscribers are still coming out of the East

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [16]

Right. That is helpful. Is it fair to assume that the number of distribution points for Western Canada isn't where you want it to be? Maybe you can give us an update on your plans to potentially increase your distribution presence up there?

Alek Krstajic,  WIND - EVP and President   [17]

I can't give you any details on our distribution strategy but I can tell you that if you are trying to grow a business, you are always interested in getting more points of distribution. And so we have got some pretty smart folks that are working hard to try to make sure that we are everywhere our customers are to live, work and play

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [18]

Got it. Okay. I guess my point, we should not assume that there is going to be a nice spike in distribution points anytime soon for you guys on the wireless side

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alek Krstajic,  WIND - EVP and President   [19]

I don't -- I think distribution is a long game. It is hard to build stores, get leases, all that stuff. I don't think you will see any kind of spike

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [20]

Right. Okay. That is hopeful. And then last question for me, on ViaWest. Obviously, if we were to step back and look at your overall business segments, you had significant growth opportunity and investments ahead of you for your core cable and wireless businesses

But ViaWest also has a big growth opportunity and doesn't contribute a lot of cash flow. It's neutral. Just wondering where you rank your priority when you are looking at the different investment options? Or potentially do you look at ViaWest as potentially following the same path as Shaw Media one day? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO   [21]

Hi. It is Vito here. Well, we just absolutely love what Nancy and the team are doing south of the border and as they help us continue to build our Canadian business, we love the returns. And we think the overall -- and maybe I'll ask Nancy and Brad to chime in here as well, if you like. But the overall market and the demand and the space that we are creating for ourselves is quite unique and continues to return handsomely for us

So we are prepared, quite frankly, to continue to invest in that business. I think a way to think about it over the next couple of years is sort of free cash flow neutral so the investment profile that -- the cash that Nancy and team generate will be reinvested. And maybe, Nancy, want to elaborate on little bit?

Nancy Phillips,  ViaWest - CEO   [22]

No, I think that is right. I think we feel, obviously, continuing to see very high demand for our hybrid platform of services and certainly many of the security of services that we have added here over the last 12 to 18 months

And I would agree wholeheartedly with Vito in terms of the capital investment. We are making the right investments in the right markets

We just brought our Plano facility online here in September so we have got capacity in a very important market [amongst] all the markets that we represent. Again, we feel very good about the growth profile of business where we are at and the capital intensity that we have applied for both our colocation and cloud-based platforms

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [23]

Phil, this is Brad. The only thing I would add in there as you look at our pivot this past year and long-term growth and what we are doing, we have three key buckets here that are the growth profile and we are going to make sure that we have managed those. Listen, as we pivoted, there is a little bit of work to do on your stride and how you go forward and everything that has to happen and so all that part of the planning process

But we feel that the performance of the three growth engines are excellent and we want to continue to support that. Timing, cadence and how fast and how far we go really depends on a variety of things, the competitive nature of things

Our timing to come to market. We feel very good and we feel we can support them all as we go forward

A couple for me. One for Vito. Vito, could you give us a little more color on the free cash flow walk down? If we look at the EBITDA and CapEx guidance, I am wondering if there is any add backs on cash taxes or pension accruals or anything that gives you confidence you can get to the CAD400 million

Second, just a comment on what you are seeing regionally in Alberta and Vancouver. There has been some noise about the Vancouver housing market and oil prices have recovered a bit, but just wondering what you are seeing from a macro perspective there. Thanks

 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO   [27]

Maybe I will take the first one and Jay you can pick up the second one. Our free cash flow below the line actually gets a little clearer here as the years move on. We have got a pretty significant reduction in free cash flow taxes planned for next year and that emanates from the fact that FY16, Tim, represented the last year of our partnership deferral pick up

Those rules were enacted a few years ago. I would guide the street to a free cash flow full-year number of CAD200 million range

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [28]

Got you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO   [29]

So that contributes significantly to it. And then obviously, the other significant item there is your interest number and I don't see major -- any significant changes here on the interest line through the year. So you can plug in a CAD300 million range number there, which is really consistent with where we landed

We have CAD400 million of bonds coming due in March and when I look at the FY17 year from where we are standing right now, obviously, it does not have any new financings in there other than potentially the refinancing of that

Other than that, of course, it includes a full year of our Corus dividends. I remember you heckling me last quarter for why is Corus dividends in there, but that is in there of course. We will take it from there. Those are the only [media-key] components

And when you do the math on that, obviously you will get to your own number on it. We have got the EBITDA and we have got the CapEx and we are committed to delivering more than CAD400 million and as the EBITDA progresses through the year, we will modify. There is obviously, in the CapEx numbers, there is a significant component of success-based capital and that will move around depending, obviously, on how our initiatives are proceeded

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [30]

Just to confirm though, Vito, that free cash flow includes the Corus dividends as if they were paid in cash?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO   [31]

That is correct

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [32]

Okay. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP   [33]

Picking up on the macro economic question, I think, Tim, I think it is clear, and both of us who live and work and raise families in Calgary understand the economic environment. It is, as you can imagine, it is tough, particularly in the small business segment, but throughout the entire economy. And obviously no business, including ours, is immune to that

Clearly Fort McMurray is going through a not normal period, although tremendous resolve from that community to rebuild. There are parts of Alberta that are similarly struggling. We're holding up fine in Edmonton and Edmonton seems to be holding up well

The British Columbia market is very strong from a macroeconomic point of view. Of course, in our business, it is a very monthly bill price-sensitive market in Vancouver, which is just a reflection of the nature of greater Vancouver and the relationship between incomes and housing costs. So while the overall economy is performing very well, I think it is lots of attention to monthly bills and a very strong response to WideOpen Internet 150 in Vancouver, I think for those reasons

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [34]

Thank you

Aravinda Galappatthige, Canaccord Genuity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [37]

Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. With respect to the LTE rollout, obviously you are targeting year-end 2017

It is a fairly rapid rollout when you think of some of your peers in the past. I was wondering if you can touch on some of the main challenges in terms of -- logistically in terms of achieving that timeline? Also, I was wondering related to that, if you can touch on your level of satisfaction with hand set availability for AWS-3?

Alek Krstajic,  WIND - EVP and President   [38]

So on the first question, look, the team that is rolling this LTE network out has done this. We have done this a whole bunch of times. Brian O'Shaughnessy was the head of technology at Bell Mobility back in the day and then we did this again a Public Mobile and now we're doing it here at WIND

And so we are very confident with the timelines that we have outlined that will bring this network build in on time and on budget. Otherwise, Brad will be very mad at me. We are very confident about that and again, none of this is rocket science

With respect to your question on handsets, we have visibility on a number of handsets that are going to be available by the time LTE launches. The chip set that is in question is the Band 66 chipset from Qualcomm and a number of the handset manufacturers are incorporating that into their roadmaps. We are quite confident that by the time we turn on the first LTE locations that we will have handsets available

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [39]

Great. Thanks for that. With respect to the CapEx side, obviously you are having elevated -- somewhat of an elevated year in terms of CapEx, for obvious reasons. But as we think beyond 2017, I know that you can't discuss numbers but very generally, directionally, how should we think about the post-2017 CapEx levels

Obviously on one hand you have the LGE rollout concluding and there are some savings there and you are obviously stepping up in terms of your broadband upgrade. Should we expect a moderation there as well as we think beyond 2017?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO   [40]

Yes. I will start it off and open it up to the team, obviously. Clearly, FY17 reflects a bit of a spike related to the wireless and incorporating the LTE in our wireless numbers. So as we move forward into FY18, and whatnot, I think you can expect the wireless group to come off a little bit

Still a fair bit of build to do there but probably a peak there for wireless. Overall, again I think you see the theme here for us, which is all about revenue and growth and investing in key initiatives and ensuring that all of our customers are getting great value and just a great service across the board

We clearly understand and are committed to free cash flow growth and free cash flow growth comes with revenue and operational EBITDA growth primarily. I think it is early to call it a peak necessarily but clearly, committed to free cash flow growth here as we move forward into FY18, FY19, beyond the FY17 guidance we have provided

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [41]

Maybe building on what Vito just said, to be clear, we have been very transparent that the CAD1.3 billion that we have released for this year will complete virtually all elements of the major and medium-size communities for LTE, the rollout of X1. And not just the ultra broadband rollout of Shaw Internet WideOpen but the DOCSIS 3.1 rollout that makes the gigabit future possible in all of our major markets. So we have certainly disclosed that so that you can see that the money is going toward significant transformational investments

Throughout, if you look at both FY17, including X1 rollout and FY18, the role of success-based capital is something that is really hard to predict over many years. Obviously, we are planning on, I think you have heard loud and clear, that we're planning on growing the business and growing the business comes with success-based capital. I think it is that, that is preventing us from giving multi-year information, is what happens with success-based over time

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO   [42]

Perfect

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [43]

Thanks. A quick clarification. Vito, on the cash tax guidance, do you mind repeating that. Did you say a CAD200 million pick up year-over-year?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO   [44]

No. Absolute number of CAD200 million for [tax] 2017

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [45]

Excellent. Thank you so much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [46]

Greg MacDonald, Macquarie

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [47]

Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Just a clarification question. The CapEx for wireless that is embedded in the CAD1.3 billion, can we just deduct that, that is CAD150 million or just because that is what is left in the original guidance on what is being spent on wireless to do the build out? Or is there possibly more than that?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO   [48]

It is a little higher than that, Greg, but there is normal capital in the business that runs through. You are not too far off the range (Multiple Speakers)

Alek Krstajic,  WIND - EVP and President   [49]

The math on the build capital is right. Of course, what you are missing in that is there's wireless maintenance and other wireless capital which isn't a massive number but you have to net that up, which is the regular ongoing piece. Right?

Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [50]

Right. I got that. But there is no expansion beyond the original intended?

Alek Krstajic,  WIND - EVP and President   [51]

That is right

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [52]

Okay. Question on DOCSIS 3.1 because it was mentioned in the press release. Not sure if I missed something because I have to admit I did not get the chance to read through the release fully, but timing, could you comment on timing when you're going to be 3.1 ready?
 And on marginal investment that is necessary for that? And Rogers has made a big deal that it is only CAD50 a home pass but I think we all know that there is some spending on the network component to get to a point where you can actually say CAD50 a home on the device. Can you give some color around that? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [53]

My suspicion, and we have not had a discussion on this particular point, is I think you are correct. I am assuming that CAD50 is the incremental cost on the gateway in the home as you purchase DOCSIS 3.1. I think that math suggests that your network upgrades, node splits, CMTS conversions for CCAP, are kind of table stakes in the conversation because you would do that anyway

If that is how you calculate it, then we think that is right. For sure, and if you look at our converged network strategy, our converged network fiber deep strategy is in service of the DOCSIS 3.1 and gigabit Internet and all the things that come with that

So all of that is built into our long-term plans. I am not sure we can give you too much except to say that DOCSIS 3.1 will be available to the vast majority of customer homes by the end of FY17

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [54]

Jay, what I would ask it is there any outside spending on the node splitting, et cetera, component of it to be DOCSIS 3.1 ready or has that -- is that normal course and we're not seeing a spike this year for that?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP   [55]

I don't mind being transparent because I don't think it is a bad story. To be clear, we are doing about 25% more nodes splits than we would have done in the average of the last five years

I don't think that is a particularly material number the shifts much in the model. Nodes splits are only one small piece of the converged network that we are building but there is increased activity, if an extra 25% fiber nodes is increased activity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [56]

Okay. Is there anything to say on continuation of that spend through 2018 or 2019 or are you just not willing to talk about those years?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP   [57]

I mean you get yourself into --

Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [58]

I guess what I'm asking over is, where are we in the CapEx cycle on cable network spending? Are we at the peak in 2017 or not?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP   [59]

The total network spend in terms of the cable network upgrades, you're looking at CAD1.3 billion, right?

Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [60]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP   [61]

There is an awful lot of that on success base. The total network spend is 1/6 or 1/7 of that total number and there are ups and downs. I would think if you took a five-year rolling average, I don't think you will see material shifts against the five-year rolling average

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO   [62]

I think you would see consistent spending on the network side of things there. It is sort of reflected in our FY17 base plus or minus 10% on it. But as Jay said, overall, relatively, I wouldn't say small but insignificant in absolute dollars but relative to our overall capital guidance, probably third, fourth, fifth largest single bucket

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [63]

Okay. That is helpful. On timing on sort of ready to go with DOCSIS 3.1?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP   [64]

You said into fiscal, right?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [65]

Yes. I said everywhere that matters and the fiscal, surmise from that. I think you have read from other players when they are going to be ready, we are going to be right there. You will certainly see some product offerings in the spring

Maher Yaghi, Desjardins Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Capital Markets - Analyst   [68]

Thank you for taking my question. Can you help us understand the way you are looking at your hand set subsidy model for wireless. When we look for the end of your upgrade cycle for LTE and, given that handsets that -- the hand set cycle that was launched this year did not include Band 66, I am trying to understand for most, if not all customers, who want to benefit from your LTE network will require a new handset

I am trying to figure out -- I am trying to wrap my head around your handset subsidy and what is that going to imply in terms of CapEx allocation?

Alek Krstajic,  WIND - EVP and President   [69]

Thanks for the question. I think it is too early to get into discussing what -- and quite frankly, I would not discuss what the subsidy strategy will be around handsets. What I will say is that I don't think this is any different than what every other carrier has gone through in the past when they have upgraded to LTE. And if people want to take advantage of the benefits of a new network, they have to get a handset

What we have seen happen is the cost of handsets has continually decreased. I think the availability in calendar 2017 of low price Band 66 handsets will make it very simple so that I don't think there is any major hurdles to overcome on this issue

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP   [70]

I would agree, Alek. As we do our longer-term projections, it is not capital, Maher, but it is working capital

If you think about the cash to pay for the equipment and then whatever, whether the customer is on a [tab or a tab boost] program. But not overly significant if we proceed with the existing sort of model

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Capital Markets - Analyst   [71]

Right. This is something we will probably be talking about next year but just in terms of the model itself, we are seeing more and more handset life cycle being extended. So in order to get a customer to switch, it is going to be requiring more upfront payments

When you look at your cash flow programs for beyond 2017, in addition to the CapEx cycle for network upgrade on cable and ViaWest growth, et cetera. When you look at your capital allocation, it all is within the free cash flow metrics that you are producing. Maybe trying to understand long-term how the debt structure is going to look like in maybe 2018, 2019

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP   [72]

Yes. Maybe we are ahead of ourselves. I'm happy to take off-line with you, Maher I think it does start with what is our customer proposition and how do we want to position ourselves in the market place

Is it something different than today? What does that look like? As you say, there's a lot of moving pieces

I think as the commercial team works through that, we will obviously be part and parcel of what's the potential implication or consequence of that. We will let the commercial guys lean in and develop their strategy and do their work

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Capital Markets - Analyst   [73]

Okay. That is fair. And just my last question is on your guidance. If I look at your consolidated guidance, and I know you have not broken up the guidance by segments but are there any segments that will show trends in terms of growth that is different -- materially different in 2017 versus what you saw in 2016? When I look at consumer business network services or business infrastructure services

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP   [74]

That's is a tricky question. Listen, when it comes to BNS, BIS in wireless, we really like what we are seeing. Obviously, Business Infrastructure Services, FY16 over FY15 have the impact of INetU

Those growth rates will moderate as we move into FY17 over FY16 and obviously FY16 also reflected the favorable foreign exchange but double-digit revenue, EBITDA, we are very, very comfortable there. We like what is happening in Business Network Services, wireless, we're going to obviously -- we're not going to give you guidance on what we see the wireless business doing but we like what we see there

So to answer your question, no fundamental changes in the health. If anything, on the front foot across those three business units and the investment on the consumer side, as we said

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Capital Markets - Analyst   [75]

Okay. Thank you very much

Rob Goff, Echelon Wealth Partners

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Echelon Wealth Partners - Analyst   [77]

Thank you very much for taking my question. I actually have two questions. The first one would be a little bit backward looking

Could you address the level of price increases that you took in August? And then the second question would be, you had talked to the take-up rates on the two-year packages. Could you repeat what that level was and whether or not you sort of have a steady state percentage that you would like that to be at? Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO   [78]

You want me to start with August? In August about 95% of all of our consumer cable experienced an increase. I would say that Internet increased CAD2 to CAD3 and video increased CAD3 to CAD5

When you look across our customer base, maybe a rule of thumb would be three quarters of our customer base will experience a bill increase of CAD3 to CAD5-ish Trevor, is that-- you're good with that, right?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and Chief Strategy &amp; Business Development Officer    [79]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO   [80]

CAD3 to CAD 5. That is sort of the range of that we did in August. Obviously, all of that is public information. Any additional color on that, Jay?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP   [81]

Just to say that the response has been consistent with previous years. Conversion rate consistent with previous years

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Echelon Wealth Partners - Analyst   [82]

Okay. Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP   [83]

Sorry, the second question was around the two-year plan?

Rob Goff,  Echelon Wealth Partners - Analyst   [84]

Yes. I did not quite get what that current tick-up rates were and then the follow on there was, is there a level that you would like to see in the marketplace taking the two-year tick-ups?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP   [85]

Yes. I think what we wanted to do was create an environment with symmetrical competition and really the need to pivot to the growth by reducing our churn. I would say we are achieving both of those objectives and like the results so far

As a design principle, we would like more than half of our customers, overall of our gross adds, to join us on value plans. I think it is fair to say we have been achieving that number

From a competitive perspective, we're happy to play. It is clear that the shift in a competitive trajectory was not understandably being well received by some of our competition. They have got more aggressive outside of service agreements. That is okay too. We are trying to create symmetrical competition and we are happy to play in whatever space makes sense

I think those are high level design principles that can help you, Rob, but they are certainly not guiding in that we are married to them. We are pretty excited about what is made possible with the combination of altered broadband powered by DOCSIS 3.1 with the launch of X1 and the arrival of wireless. And so we are prepared to play in the competitive environment in order to change the competitive trajectory from the historical levels

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Rob Goff,  Echelon Wealth Partners - Analyst   [86]

Robert Peters, Credit Suisse

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Robert Peters,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [89]

Thanks very much for taking my question. Just wondering, when we look at the cable side of things and the cost associated with the kind of ramp up of FreeRange TV, just wondering if you can quantify or give us maybe some idea of how much of those kind of directly overlap with the X1 spending

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alek Krstajic,  WIND - EVP and President   [90]

In terms of cost, to be clear, when we talk about next generation video or X1 costs, we are talking about the whole program and, regardless of whether or not it is paid on operating maintenance basis or a license fee or whatever the piece of that is, we conclude -- we consider FreeRange and X1 to be all one bucket. We disclosed that in FY17 that was roughly CAD75 million, which broke down CAD25 million in OpEx and CAD50 million in CapEx

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Robert Peters,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [91]

That was FY16?

Alek Krstajic,  WIND - EVP and President   [92]

That was FY16. And then in FY17 the total amount is about the same, CAD75 million with the numbers reversed, CAD50 million going into OpEx and CAD25 million in CapEx. We said that a quarter or two ago and we have got costs [certainly] so that is how things are unfolding

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [93]

That is correct

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Robert Peters,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [94]

Perfect. Thank you very much. May be just a question on satellite. When you look at the satellite business, I notice you guys are investing to convert some of the channels from the MPEG-2 encoding to the MPEG-4 encoding

And so clearly there is investment being made there. I was just wondering, when we think about satellite long-term, I was wondering have you disclosed the mix between the rural and the urban subscribers or kind of provide any outside of your footprint subscriber base?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [95]

I don't think that we have done a sort of by-province disclosure. We have certainly disclosed that we consider 2/3 of our base to be rural and that is consistent and very much how we think about the business. The business is performing well and has had some general stability

A reminder to everybody that we have the cabin and camp disconnect that happened in Q1 and that is roughly about 10,000 connections. You will probably see them again in Q1 and you will see a strong spring as cabin and camp connects come on. I think the math of that MPEG-2, MPEG-4 conversion, you will like in terms of what it means for long-term transponder cost savings and what it does to consumer margins in years three, four and five

It also brings a modern and significantly improved experience in a number of customers' homes. I think that is pretty much a no regrets investment as you see us roll through that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Robert Peters,  Credit Suisse - Analyst   [96]

Does the conversion to MPEG-4 open up the ability to do 4K on the satellite or is that something where you need a new one launched?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [97]

I don't think we are speaking about 4K on satellite. I think you are correct in suggesting the capacity available creates optionality and flexibly. Maybe we will be leave that there

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions)
 The first question comes from Vince Valentini with TD Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [2]

Yes, thanks very much. Let me ask about the X1 pace of deployment. The product looks fantastic. We've seen what its done for Comcast. Should we think about their pace of deployment, getting up to 40% of their subs after a couple years, as what you would be targeting? Or do you think you can go even faster, given the learnings of what they've done? And also maybe, if you can give us any update on how fast other markets other than Calgary will be getting the product as well, that would be great. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [3]

Vince, it's Jay. Thank you for the question and we agree, the platform looks terrific. We've learned a lot from the Comcast playbook, really over five years of deployment in some form and three years of going pretty hard at it. And we love their playbook and will be following that playbook. As we all appreciate, we're joining a moving train, so we get to join the road map where it is today, not where it was two and a half years ago. So we've got a much stronger product today than they had two and a half years ago to be able to bring into the marketplace. So when you think about whether you count it as three or four or five years to get to where they are today, it's certainly our view that it won't take us that long, because we've got a stronger product and a path to get there

That having been said, we've launched in Calgary. We're going to launch in Vancouver within a matter of weeks, not months. And then we'll be everywhere else, we'll be in most other markets this spring. So it's a relatively quick launch, making it available to consumers. As you think through this, remember that this is a premium experience bundled with a WideOpen Internet 150 that most Western Canadian customers can't get from our competitors. And so we're really entering the market within that space. So there was a little more to your question than that, but I don't know if that's a good start?

Vince Valentini,  TD Securities - Analyst   [4]

No, that's good for now. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [5]

The next question comes from Jeff Fan from Scotiabank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [6]

Thanks and good afternoon. Just wanted to ask you a question about, also on the BlueSky. Jay, I think you've alluded to this before that you've been seeding with a lot of your existing customer base with the compatible equipment inside the home. So I'm just wondering, as you hit the market, how were the priorities? Are you going after new customers? Are you looking after migrating some of these existing customers with compatible boxes to the platform? And just wondering where your priorities are, and maybe we start there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [7]

Thanks, Jeff. It's a great question. As we talked about, we joined the Comcast equipment road map a couple of years ago as we started down this path, and we were able to realize immediate benefits in terms of cost savings that were dramatic in terms of costs that we were financing our gateway. So every box we've bought in the last 18 months is a compatible XG-1. In fact, it's exactly the same box that we're deploying today with the installs that we're doing in Calgary

So we're coming up on a couple hundred thousand of those boxes that are already into deployment today. And so clearly, that's an easy place to start. And because those customers are recent, have interacted with us recently, many of them are already on 150; and those that aren't, we'd love to have come on board to WideOpen 150. So it's a great cost effective way to get immediate traction. We also want to put our best premium product forward to new customers, so as customers are choosing between Optic and maybe the 50 mg service that's available to most consumers in our region, they have an opportunity to weigh that against WideOpen and BlueSky together

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [8]

And maybe switching gears a little bit, sitting back, looking at capital allocation, maybe a question for Vito. Can you talk a little bit about how the capital spend this year within your guidance is going to shake out across the various divisions, just to give us some clarity of visibility into how it breaks down? And one question in there is about the capital spend in ViaWest. Good cash flow from that segment this quarter. Is there just timing related to that or should we expect that CapEx to come up? So an overall breakdown and maybe just specifically touch on ViaWest a little bit

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; CFO   [9]

Maybe I'll address the second one first. You're absolutely right. Simple free cash flow from ViaWest was positive in the quarter. Very pleased with that. That was primarily timing related. As we look at FY17 in aggregate, we expect that business to be plus or minus a couple million dollars on that, so call it flat. There will always be a few FX-related issues there. But that's the guidance that we provided on that, and that's what Nancy and team are marching to and committed to

Overall, I think, Jeff, your question about where are we allocating capital, when we look at our aggregate spend of the [CAD1.3 billion], we've got about 60% of it geared towards growth initiatives, and that would obviously be primarily obviously wireless, including all of our business infrastructure services and all of our success base with BlueSky TV, and also, obviously, Ron's BNS activity. So we're really pleased on how we've pivoted the capital focus primarily on growth

We still obviously have some maintenance of sustaining. Our network continues to be in really great shape and we're never going to lose sight of that and continue to make the appropriate investment. But I'd say about two-thirds of it geared towards what we would say is growth initiatives

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [10]

And maybe finally for you, Vito, just sitting back, looking at the balance sheet and leverage, where do you sit right now, how comfortable are you, and then with respect to investment grade, have you had any conversations with agencies recently and where you stand on that?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; CFO   [11]

We sit at about 2.5 on the leverage front, which is we're very, very comfortable with it, totally committed to investment grade. As we look at the next few years, we really like the balance of free cash flow and capital profile and capital investment required. So we don't see ourselves reaching out too much over that

Conversations with rating agencies are very, very constructive. I think the last six months, particularly as our assets have settled into place, particularly after all the transactions we've made and been able to communicate the clarity around that, I'd say everybody is feeling pretty good about things

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeff Fan,  Scotiabank - Analyst   [12]

Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys

The next question comes from Phillip Huang with Barclays

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [14]

Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. First, I wanted to just quickly touch on the wireless business for a moment. We've all seen the new catchy marketing campaign for Freedom Mobile through December. I was wondering if you guys have any early sense on how the market is responding to the new marketing campaign. And certainly there's, as with every year, there's quite a bit of seasonal activity at that time and was wondering if after you guys did the LTE launch and the rebranding, whether we should expect in the coming quarters to see a strong recovery

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; President - Freedom Mobile   [15]

Hi, Phil. Alek Krstajic here. Look, everything we've seen, the Freedom Mobile launch has been a real success. The social media response that we've been monitoring has been very, very positive, some of the blogs. So the feedback we're getting is great. Customers calling to the call center have indicated they love it. I ran into one of my competitor CEOs, and he even reluctantly admitted he loved the name. So for what it's worth. So we're very, very excited about that. I think we've found something that is going to resonate with everybody out there

And vis-a-vis the second part of your question, we did see an uptick. I think that what you're going to see in terms of the lift from LTE is very good. Now we still have limited handsets, so I'm bullish on LTE. But it's going to be awhile for the ramp up to happen. We tend to monitor, as long as I've been in this business and with all the different companies, we always look for when does the traffic start to really increase in the stores. Five or six years ago, we would have seen Christmas traffic start to accelerate around December 8, 9 or 10. This year, it really didn't start to happen until the latter part of December. But notwithstanding that, we had a solid December and I think you'll see a good recovery

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [16]

That's very helpful. Thanks. And then if I could switch gears and touch on the set top box for X1 again. I believe the software upgrade to those boxes, can they be done remotely? Or I just wanted to better understand the process for the couple hundred thousand boxes already in the market. What is the best way to actually get those boxes to be ready to actually have the X1? Is it for them to come in and swap for another similar box that's already been upgraded for the software? Just wanted to get your thoughts on logistics of getting those boxes with X1. Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [17]

Yes, it's a good conversation, a detailed question, Phil. Thank you. In terms of the rollout today, we haven't started with that base today, first of all, because we've got plenty of demand. And at this moment today, our practice, because we're keeping things simple, is that the box comes back into the warehouse and gets redeployed with the software on top of it. Our partners are able to do that in a more free flowing process and it's on our road map shortly. So by the time we get to addressing that base, we'll be able to make that transition in the home today, but we're not, on launch day we're not doing that at this moment. We'll be ready in lots of time to take advantage of that opportunity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [18]

Got it. And then looking into the longer term, where do you see the platform taking Shaw with service in the home? Obviously, the demo yesterday was super helpful and very encouraging to see such a strong road map for the platform going forward. Do you see other areas that could expand your services to make it, to make broadband and television even more sticky in the home?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [19]

Yes. Thank you for the opportunity. We're so excited about this platform and what it makes possible. And even just coming back from CES this week, what you saw everywhere at CES was voice recognition. And it wasn't that the voice recognition was necessarily new, although it's getting a little bit better, it was because of the level of control that that layer gives people to the complex elements of their homes and their lives and their digital experience and Internet of Things

And to be clear, when you talk about our vision, our vision is Tony Warner and Comcast vision, we've talked all along about if they're planting tulips, we're planting tulips. But the vision is that this home operating system will create the aggregation and simplicity. And in Comcast's model, they're adjusting thermostats and lights and we're headed down all those paths, too. And it really becomes about simplification and aggregation in the home and using BlueSky as your entry point. So correctly identified for us, it's a lot more than video or a lot more than IPTV

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays Capital - Analyst   [20]

The next question comes from Drew McReynolds with RBC Capital Markets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [22]

Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Just two for me. Alek, can you just talk to the LTE handset road map that you think is in front of you, just in terms of getting more handsets available in your spectrum band? And second question, you provided previously some X1 OpEx and CapEx guidance, about CAD75 million, I think, for FY17. And I think two-thirds of that was OpEx this year. Just want to firm up those numbers, if they're still relevant, just given the timing and all of what you're doing on the deployment. Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; President - Freedom Mobile   [23]

Sure. Drew, we've got a road map that basically starts, obviously, with the LGB20 and the ZTE handset we've got in market now. They were a little bit delayed, but the patch of Qualcomm came through and so they're all good to go. By spring, you'll see a couple more handsets roll out. And then we really see, by summertime and by early fall, really filling in with all the other major manufactures and all of their models having band 66 handsets

And again, this is being driven largely by US carriers who are also looking for a band 66 ready handset to be able to do AWS3-LTE. So I would expect that by the end of our fiscal year, by end of August, you're going to see most of the major brands with band 66 handsets in our lineup

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; CFO   [24]

Drew, it's Vito here. In respect to your second question, I think the CAD75 million is we're very much still in that ballpark as it relates to FY17. So no update to that. And obviously, it will move around a little bit. But no significant departure from what we've previously said there

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst   [25]

Okay. Thank you very much

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [26]

The next question is from Tim Casey with BMO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [27]

Thank you. A couple for me. Alek, could we just clarify, do you expect to have new iPhones in the line up this calendar year? And Vito, could you talk a little bit directionally how we should think about margins with respect to X1 and the fees you'll be paying to Comcast? Like should we think of it as a J curve type model that expands with wider deployment or is it more, do you think it's going to be less variable, will be more flat line in terms of margins? Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; President - Freedom Mobile   [28]

It's Alek. With respect to the iPhone, it's really a question that only Apple can answer. But I would say to you that Apple has had, if history repeats itself, Apple has had a strategy where they have traditionally tried to do, even mid model upgrades, where they include the latest and greatest chip sets to appeal to as many bands as possible

If you look at the iPhone 5S, it worked on AWS1. But actually, the iPhone 5, halfway through, they made a chip set change. So we don't know for sure what's going to happen with Apple. But if history repeats itself, we should, by the end of this year, see an Apple iPhone that does have AWS3 capability. Now we don't have a relationship with Apple right now. So there's really two steps here. One is for us to establish a relationship and the second is for Apple to actually have a phone

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; CFO   [29]

Tim, it's Vito here. In respect to your second question, great question. Obviously, we're not going to get too detailed into the terms of our contract with Comcast. But I think you described it appropriately that over, as we get more boxes into the system, obviously on the back of our customers, our per unit costs related to supplying BlueSky will be coming down on a per unit basis through the period. That's the operational cost impact associated with that

As Jay's mentioned, and Jay, you can tag on to this, when we think about how we're packaging it, premium, what does it overall do from a margin perspective and a churn benefit and all the rest of it, obviously we're very, very comfortable that at the end of the day, notwithstanding the costs related to this great platform, that we're going to be further ahead than we otherwise would have been

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst   [30]

The next question is from Aravinda Galappatthige with Canaccord Genuity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [32]

Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to touch on WideOpen 150. You talked about the take-up there since you launched the product earlier last year. Can you just touch on the competitive response you're seeing to that product? We obviously see some set of competitive offers online. But I want to get a sense from at the ground level what you're seeing. And also connected to that, what kind of reprice risk do you see, particularly on the consumer side, as you get to the back half of the year?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [33]

Great. Taken together, we're delighted with the progress of WideOpen Internet 150. It's doing exactly what we wanted it to do in the marketplace. You correctly identified, there was a relatively small number of customers that would have had to enter into a two-year service agreement in order to lower their rate. And a good percentage of them have already done so and are already reflected in our Q1 numbers, and all of that has happened quite elegantly and in a way that we were expected

ARPU for internet is still up very nicely on a year-over-year basis and we're through the vast majority of that. Our customers in Western Canada, I think, are a little bit more aware of their monthly bills than maybe in other parts of the country, because of the level of competitive activity that we've had for so many years here. So that reprice is largely happened and you won't, you see it already in our numbers. And again, internet ARPU maintains a nice, healthy increase on a year-over-year basis. So nothing to be terribly concerned there

In terms of the competitive dynamic, it's fair to say nothing comes easily in this world, and it's fair to say that we had lots of activity in the market, and by the way, we also participated in the marketplace. And so as you can expect with these kinds of change in trajectories, as you've seen in our numbers, it wasn't done without some dust ups both ways

The most aggressive of those offers are no longer available from either one of us and we'll see how the marketplace unfolds. It's a very different experience for us to be in those kinds of dust ups with a positively differentiated product for the majority of Western Canadians on broadband, and now today with a positively differentiated product on video. So we'll engage as much as we have to, but it's looking good today

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [34]

Okay. Thanks for that. And my last question, on network services, obviously very good EBITDA number. If we're looking at mid single-digit revenue growth as the baseline, is that type of operating leverage, or even something close to it, is that sustainable? Is there something in the model that we should know as we try to forecast the upcoming quarters?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [35]

You're asking if -- I'll let Vito start and then --

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; CFO   [36]

Sure, yes, [Arinda], you're absolutely right. Our Q1 was plus 5.8% overall. But what we're most excited about, quite frankly, is when you exclude the satellite numbers from that, our core, as we call it, is 9.6%. And the percentages obviously are impacted by relatively, obviously, the absolute amounts here. And we're very, very comfortable that the team and the product set and what's happened in our monthly recurring revenue and peak installations as we're moving forward, double-digit growth across that business for our FY17 is definitely possible

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [37]

And we're certainly watching a trend here where we've been talking about our Smart Services. And SmartWiFi and SmartVoice are both posting double-digit growth on a month-over-month basis. And so we're on the right trajectory. As we've talked about, it takes a period of time, because you've got legacy businesses in that revenue, for that revenue to be big enough to be able to actually turn the ship. And so we see only upside as we move into this business in FY18, as really the Smart Services take over not only the revenue growth, but a larger proportion of revenue

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; CFO   [38]

And continuing to invest in that. So you might not, on the EBITDA side, you might see some choppiness there. We're not going to, but we're going to appropriately invest in our product as we move forward quarter to quarter and put on the revenue side, echo everything Jay said there, double digits

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst   [39]

Okay. Thank you. That makes sense. I'll pass the line

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [40]

The next question comes from Greg MacDonald with Macquarie

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [41]

Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Looking back at the wireless quarter, it was pretty obvious that there was some scaling back in promo activity as you went into the Freedom launch. But Brad also commented that there was some competitive activity, as well. If you just describe it in terms of increase of churn versus decrease of gross adds in how the subscriber count played out for the quarter, what was the bigger impact? Was it customers churning off to get these free iPhones that were in the market or was it more a decline in the promotional activity and therefore gross adds that played out?

Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; President - Freedom Mobile   [42]

It's Alek. I'm not sure I can quantify it like that. If I had to pick, I would say the fact that we purposely slowed down. We started early in the quarter slowing down our advertising spend, really for two reasons

One, you don't want to have -- you don't want to be spending money promoting a brand you're about to make disappear, namely Wind, and replace it with Freedom Mobile. The second thing is that as you promote and get more customers in that come in 30 or 60 days before you launch LTE, a number of the ones that buy the higher end phones are actually going to be annoyed because they would have rather waited and bought an LTE handset in December

So I think what happened was there was a very purposeful decision to slow sales down. And then I think what happened was there was some pricing in the market that really was quite aggressive and irrational, specifically the CAD40 4-gigabyte rate plan. And I would say that rate plan, it provoked a response from all the incumbents, and so it helped accentuate the slower sales on our side. The great news is we think we've seen now that all those, what I would call irrational rate plans have been pulled out of the market, and so we should see rational numbers start to increase again

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [43]

So you made reference to that, Alek. Does that suggest there, therefore, that activity has returned back to normal levels, or are you still not quite seeing that yet?

Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; President - Freedom Mobile   [44]

No, we started seeing, once we launched Freedom Mobile and in December, the Christmas rush and Boxing Week, we started seeing sales accelerate very, very nicely. So we started building momentum again. I'm referring to the fact that just in the last day or so, all of the flankers seem to have pulled the aggressive promotional pricing that they had, and so that generally means that we become a bit more attractive. I think that the impact from last quarter was really significant, because if you've got a CAD40 4-gigabyte rate plan that's LTE, it starts to really shine a light on our deficiency having only a 3G rate plan. In 2017, with a robust LTE offering as the year unfolds, I'm less worried about how those rate plans will affect us

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [45]

Okay. And final question

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [46]

No, carry on, you're good

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [47]

Was there a bigger Ontario versus West impact or was that not really the case?

Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; President - Freedom Mobile   [48]

No, I think it was across the board

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Greg MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Analyst   [49]

Great. Thanks a lot, guys

The next question comes from David McFadgen with Cormark Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David McFadgen,  Cormark Securities - Analyst   [51]

Yes. Great. Thank you. Two questions. In the event that the CapEx, the CAD1.3 billion, doesn't drop probably modestly next year, in the event that it doesn't go down, do you anticipate that you would take Corus cash dividends as opposed to the drip, in order to get your payout ratio down below 100% on the dividend?
 And then secondly, I see that you're going to be leveraging the Shaw Wi-Fi hotspots with Freedom. I know it's free until March 31. After that point in time, it's included in some plans, but some plans it is not. And so the plans that it is not, what would be the incremental monthly fee? Would it be something in the order of CAD5? Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; CFO   [52]

David, it's Vito here. First question, a little bit of a hypothetical question. And we're a very disciplined company when it comes to the capital side of things. The teams work very, very hard in allocating and being efficient and keeping to their commitments. So I expect no material departure from the CAD1.3 billion we've committed this year. And if there is departure, it's strategic, it's growth based, it's in the best interest of our shareholders

Overall, we're managing free cash flow. We very much like, obviously, our Corus investment, of what we're dripping and whatnot, and we'll defer that decision, if you will, to the appropriate time as to when we come off the drip and what all that looks like. I'd rather separate the two issues, for the time being. Second one, sorry I didn't --

Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; President - Freedom Mobile   [53]

Second one was for me. There's no decisions been taken yet on pricing around a Wi-Fi add-on

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David McFadgen,  Cormark Securities - Analyst   [54]

Okay. But do you anticipate that there would be a bit of a charge, if someone wanted it?

Alek Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; President - Freedom Mobile   [55]

We're really looking at all of the strategic aspects of that. There's an argument to be made for inclusion. There's an argument to be made for inclusion with bundles. There's an argument to be made for actually charging an incremental fee. So you're going to have to wait, because I haven't got an answer on that one

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 David McFadgen,  Cormark Securities - Analyst   [56]

Okay. Great. Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [57]

What we can say is having activated it, we've been very pleasantly surprised with the volume that Freedom customers are using on the Wi-Fi network. There's no question that it's unleashed a level of data activity that was beyond our expectations. So great value there

Questions and Answers

Operator   [1]

(Operator Instructions) The first question today comes from Jeff Fan with Scotiabank

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst   [2]

Good quarter on cable, and I want to touch on that very quickly. On the consumer TV adds that you saw or TV improvement that you saw in the quarter, wonder if you can just help break down a little bit for us what is helping that achievement on a year-over-year basis. Is it the specific BlueSky? Or is it Internet driven? And if you can just shed some light on what's happening with gross adds versus churn within the consumer TV, that would be really helpful

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [3]

Yes, great. Thanks, Jeff. It's Jay, and happy to share some color there. We had BlueSky in Calgary for the quarter, which was certainly helpful, and a month of BlueSky in Vancouver, and that absolutely is visible in our video results. To be clear, as you look at the cable business, and it's actually true of the satellite business as well, we've seen quite significant churn reduction year-over-year over the quarter. And that's just the implementation of our strategic plan, our focus on network congestion, network advantage, the way we're selling service premiums. Gross sales actually weren't up year-over-year, although we had some nice response to BlueSky in the markets that we launched. The story is really a story of churn reduction, which I think you'll like

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst   [4]

And as we look over the next -- as you ramp up BlueSky now across all of your markets, how do you expect this dynamic to unfold either for the rest of the year or next year, however you want to sort of phrase it?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [5]

Yes. Jeff, we're super excited that April 5, we launched BlueSky nationally and have paired it with 150. We've -- you've asked us some version of this question for the last couple of years, and we've responded with marbles in our mouth. We're completely excited about what's made possible about making BlueSky and 150 available to all of our footprint. This was the plan. To be clear, winning looks like positive video subs on cable, and we're headed in that direction. We'd be disappointed if we didn't have a positive video cable quarter in Q3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jeffrey Fan,  Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst   [6]

Well, you can spit out those marbles now. Just final question. Regarding your holdings in Corus, I know you've been receiving the DRIP in shares. Can you just -- it looks like you haven't sold any shares based on the numbers, but I just wanted to confirm that. And if you can just shed some light on, now that the lockup on those shares or 1/3 of it has come off, can you just shed some light on what your plans are with respect to that holdings going forward?

Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Non Independent Director   [7]

Sure, Jeff. It's Brad. Well, a couple of things. One is we continue to be very supportive of Doug and team over there. We love the strength of the portfolio, and we think they're just doing a top-notch job. We have right now no plans to sell any shares, either off the DRIP or in lockup as they come off. So that's pretty clear, and we're very supportive of where Corus is going right now

Operator   [8]

The next question is from Vince Valentini with TD Securities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [9]

Let me echo congrats on the strong sub numbers, and Alek, all the best in your future endeavors. A couple of questions. First, just to stick on the video and BlueSky for a second, first, can you clarify where you are with Netflix or any other OTT services in terms of integrating them? And second is, you say positive sub adds would be your goal, Jay. Should we think of you guys starting to actively migrate existing customers and be a little more forceful with BlueSky virtually immediately? Or is there some merit in maybe waiting for the new version of X1 with the wireless platform and all IP before you really start putting a lot of boxes into the field?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [10]

Great. Thanks, Vince. This is -- what's great about where we are today is we're in market with all of our customers having access to BlueSky and 150, and we're in the position that we've been working to be able to deliver that to our customers. The reason that Brad and the direction was so clear to join Comcast was not for today, because there's lots of great video products out there. It was for the road map that comes with where we are today. So the beautiful thing about being on the Comcast road map is really every quarter and some quarters more often than that, we're bringing unique new value to consumers. And so if you look at what's been announced on the Comcast road map, all of that is planned for us. As you can appreciate, there's commercial negotiations involved in their aggregation. But remember, the platform at its core is an aggregation play. And so the philosophy of our partners is they'd like to bring all of these services, whether it's Netflix, whether it's YouTube, whether it's whatever else you would imagine, into an integrated search and into an integrated environment. So we don't want to get ahead of ourselves in terms of giving you specific dates, but we've got an exciting 2017 ahead in terms of all of our new launches and new applications that will be available to customers. In terms of migration, I think you've seen, on April 5, we launched new packaging with 150 and BlueSky. And we think that's terrific packaging for existing and new customers. Our initial response over the course of the first week has been great with both. We're running about half and half. About half of our sales are to new, and about half of our sales are to existing. And we love the pace of that, and we love the financials of what it means because people are paying more to get more and enjoying a terrific service. And we're just going to ride that wave

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vince Valentini,  TD Securities Equity Research - Analyst   [11]

Okay. And maybe I can ask you a question on wireless as well before I hop off. So Paul McAleese is cited as Chief Operating Officer. I'm not sure if -- does that mean he's your senior executive in Wireless for the foreseeable future? Or does it imply that you may be looking for a CEO for that business as well? And also on Wireless, sub numbers certainly improved, but the ARPU did not versus Q1. Are you satisfied with the mix of pricing versus volume that you're getting? Or do you guys think there's some work to do there to try to move up closer to $40 on ARPU sometime soon?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [12]

Sure. Let me talk about the leadership, and I'll let Glen answer the first ARPU question, and then we can talk about it as we go forward. We're so proud of the contribution of our Freedom team, and our -- the work that Alek and team has done has been terrific. This has always been -- the acquisition of WIND was never to operate a stand-alone wireless business. It was always a strategic acquisition, and we're taking the next step as planned and moving towards this. And so think about Freedom as a business unit just as Shaw Consumer is a business unit. And so Paul is the leader of that business unit, based in Toronto, will do an absolutely terrific job. Paul will report to me, as Alek did. And the -- no significant change there. And I think what you will see is we're becoming a wireless company a year into the transition, and you'll see us integrate all of our corporate functions and so that we'll have one finance team, and we'll have one HR team, and they'll serve both business units as clients. And that's absolutely our model going forward. I know Alek's excited about this next step. Alek was critical in bringing Paul on board, and we couldn't be more pleased with Paul's leadership. Paul is our Wireless business unit leader, and he's based in Toronto. So let me let Glen talk to you about the ARPU question

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,    [13]

So just to give you a little more color on ARPU, there's a couple of things that go into that number. There's the headline revenues we're getting, and then there are the promotional discounts that come off. And so you'll know that over the last several months, we've been making a lot of these promotional discounts as a way to upsell people to the higher ARPU plans. So the weight of that promotional spending is there in the ARPU. The good news is if you look at the -- let's say the average price point that people are coming on to Freedom, it has never been higher. That number continues to climb and was very strong in the February quarter. So the weakness you see in reported ARPU is a function of our making a lot of use of those service credits during the quarter and preceding months. I'll also add, and this won’t be apparent from the reported numbers, there's an element of seasonality as well. The February quarter is down from the November quarter. That's true this year, and it was true the year before. But on a year-on-year basis, we're still seeing a nice increase in reported ARPU despite the spending. So we're pretty happy about the trajectory on plan mix and the outlook for the future

The next question is from Phillip Huang with Barclays

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst   [15]

First, congrats to Alek and Paul on the transition. Do -- I do have a clarification question, first, for BlueSky TV. Are you guys currently offering the hybrid version of the set-top box or the full IP version of the set-top box?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [16]

Yes. To be clear, we're offering it as Comcast's offering. So it's -- we're on the road map, and we'll transition to IP over the course of the next 18 months. Today, all of our on-demand services and, of course, the interface itself is being offered on an IP basis along with all the applications that go there. We're using -- the interface tunes to the digital QAM feeds when tuning in to live TV

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst   [17]

Got it. No, that's very, very helpful. So it sounds like there's a bit of an opportunity to -- is it -- am I right in assuming that the full IP version of the box will be quite a bit cheaper, and so there's some opportunity to even further -- to lower the cost going forward then?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [18]

Yes, absolutely. The -- we moved onto the Comcast equipment road map a couple of years ago. And so the road map is compelling over the next couple of years as we move to a single gateway in the home, which becomes our DOCSIS 3.1 modem in the home, along with very sophisticated in-home applications. And ultimately, that gateway becomes the single gateway that also powers the video platform. So there's some nice cost savings over the course of the next 18 months, and we roll in that direction. To be clear, though, the cost structure that we have today is terrific, and I think you may recall we achieved tremendous cost savings over the previous gateway solutions just moving to the Comcast volume on the hardware that we're deploying today. And so I understand that others launch -- I think if you were starting today, you would probably launch and wait a year or whatever is involved in launching on an all IP basis. We're in a position where we're not same as Comcast, same as Cox. We're just going to ride that road map on an incremental basis

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst   [19]

Right, I got it. That's very helpful. And then I had a quick question on the pricing environment for wireless. Certainly appreciate Glen's comments on -- the color on sort of the reported ARPU and the seasonality, very helpful. But was wondering if you guys could give us an update on the pricing environment for wireless just because it seems like there was quite a few flanker brand promotions in the quarter with Public Mobile and chatr. Was wondering if you could comment a bit on the pricing environment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [20]

Yes. Maybe I'll just start at a high level and then will let Glen fill in some of the details. This is an interesting environment. I mean, the flankers and fighters are being extremely aggressive. They like to get underneath of some price. Freedom is an affordability plan rather than an affordability brand, and we're committed to Canadians having affordable wireless. And that's our spot, and we're going to stay in that spot and not be moved from that spot. I think over the course of the quarter, we saw December was extremely active with the flanker and fighter brands as a continuation of November. January and February, you stopped a little bit, some more activity in March. It's an interesting environment. We do want to flag that we went from under 10,000 to 33,000. I think as you heard from our comments that 2017, you're going to see stability in our RGU numbers on wireline. You've seen a strategic plan that we're well into the implementation of, and that's where we are in our business plan in our cycle. Where we are with handsets and LTE and the new brand, we’re going to see some volatility in terms of wireless subs in 2017. I think you'll see stability as we get to 2018 and move further down our plan. But that's kind of the hand that we're playing today. I'll let Glen talk more specifically about the competitive environment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,    [21]

Yes. Thanks, Jay. So as Jay mentioned in -- the Q1 weakness reflected the price wars that went on late October, November and continued to some degree in December. I mean, Boxing Week was extremely aggressive, and we've seen a much more disciplined and much more rational pricing environment through January and February. We left the service credits in place, which is the reason you see a nice subscriber result for February. If you look now, you'll see that we've got -- we've harmonized our LTE and non-LTE pricing for our smartphones starting at $40. We're not offering the service credits, so we've got a good line up there. We're seeing a -- see a more disciplined environment. But as Jay mentioned, all of this is happening as the background of evolution of our LTE capability. We started -- we launched with one handset and one rate plan. We've now got a full suite of rate plans, and we'll finish April with 5, and by the end of the calendar year..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [22]

With 5 handsets

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Glen Campbell,    [23]

Yes. Our whole -- we'll have LTE across our entire footprint and the full lineup of Android handsets. So that's the backdrop, and our view against that is the right amount of promotional intensity is -- it's hard to get it precisely right at every point in time, but we'll get to a good place

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Phillip Huang,  Barclays PLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst   [24]

Right. You guys certainly have a pricing and market share advantage, particularly in Western Canada, where you certainly have a lot of upside. I was wondering if, of the volume that you saw in the quarter, are you able to maybe provide some color geographically? Are you seeing -- obviously lower churn risk in Western Canada. But where are you seeing the biggest upside momentum in the quarter?

Glen Campbell,    [25]

So Phil, we're not going to give specific numbers, but we're really pleased by the trend we're seeing on churn. Churn is coming down steadily, very happy about that. And you know what our footprint is, the East-West mix. Our subscribers roughly reflect that. Historically, we'd been stronger in the East and weaker in the West, but since the acquisition, there has been a shift in favor of the West there. Not a dramatic one, but there's been a shift. And I think we'll leave it at that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator   [26]

The next question is from Drew McReynolds with RBC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst   [27]

A couple of questions just on the consumer side maybe for you, Jay. Can you just speak to overall consumer ARPU hopes or expectations as you deploy BlueSky through the next few years? And as a follow-up to that, surprised this quarter just to see the consumer EBITDA margins flat year-over-year. You alluded to maybe some upfront pressure as BlueSky gets deployed, and as you come off promotional pricing in the second year, you kind of get a lift in ARPU and margin. So just what are the puts and takes around consumer EBITDA margins as you look out the rest of this year and into next? That would be great

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP   [28]

It's Vito. I mean, a couple of things. First of all, on ARPU on the consumer side, you see quarter-over-quarter ARPU slightly down. Important to note that, that reflects a bit of the omission of shomi in our base numbers. So we're quite happy with how -- when we look at the total subscriber base and the revenue and the ARPU combinations, Internet is strong, video is -- obviously, the churn, significant improvement, a lot of moving pieces there. But as we look forward, they're very strong, and happy with where we're going. Working hard on the cost side of the business, obviously, to ensure that the margin side is as favorable as can be. We're really focused on value to our customers and ensuring that they stay in our system and are happy to be in our system and as our product set evolves. So I mean, that's where I'd leave it. Jay, anything from you?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [29]

Yes. I mean, I think as you get to a bigger base in deployment, you start to see a little bit of cost associated in the margin. I don't think you're going to see anything that scares you, and I think you'll see lots of upside. We would like to flag with our national launch April 5 of the BlueSky, 150 combination that, without question, it's the largest advertising campaign in our company's history, so you will see that in our Q3 results, and we think that's an important investment for the future

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drew McReynolds,  RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - Analyst   [30]

Okay. If I can squeeze just one more in, on the competitive environment in Western Canada, again, on the consumer side, just if you can provide an update. Obviously, you're gaining some success out there in the market and have a pretty good product suite that you're fully deploying and marketing. Have you seen aggressive responses from competitors? Is there any change kind of relative to last quarter or the last couple of quarters?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [31]

Yes. I think Western Canadians benefit from a highly competitive environment, and we've certainly seen a extremely competitive environment in this fiscal year in Alberta and BC. And we think our primary competitor is also doing well, and everybody's trying to grow their business. And I suspect you'll see new video solutions from them in the days and weeks ahead, so we're ready for those discussions. I think it's fair to say that the competitive environment outside of Alberta and BC has been less vibrant, and we've certainly had lots of success in Manitoba throughout the transition, and we think we could have a couple of good years in Manitoba, and so we're going to continue to lean into that. So we've got some slightly different things. Our primary competitor is fierce and does a great job, and that's what this is going to continue to be

Operator   [32]

Next question is from Tim Casey with BMO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Equity Research Analyst   [33]

Just a clarification, Jay, did you say that you expect subs -- video subs to be positive in Q3?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [34]

Yes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Equity Research Analyst   [35]

Okay. And that continuing from then on your expectation with respect to your comment about stability and trend on the wireline side?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [36]

Yes. I would like to -- so to be clear on what we said, we also expect satellite video subs to be positive in Q3, but I wasn't referring to that. I was referring to cable video subs. Going forward, I think what I would say is, what does winning look like? And I'd say winning looks like positive video subs. We are going to be in a very intense competitive environment, so does that mean every quarter? Well, I think that depends on what happens in the environment. I think that depends on the next video offering that the competitor brings and how they market it and pricing and packaging, and so there'll be all those kinds of things. But we are signaling that there's a difference in what winning looks like, and that starts in Q3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Tim Casey,  BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Equity Research Analyst   [37]

Okay, excellent. The other question I had with -- is with respect to bigger-picture wireless issues, specifically spectrum. Do you have any thoughts on expectations on timing and rules for the next low-band auction? And can you comment at all on any discussions you might be having with Quebecor with respect to their assets?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [38]

Yes. I'll talk in terms of the discussions around the rules and on the 600 auction. And 600 is important. We need low-band spectrum. We're committed to providing affordable wireless offering to Canadians, and I think Canadians want something different than what's been offered by the big 3. And low-band spectrum will help us do that. And so we think it's super important, and I think the government is consulting with all appropriate parties and following what's happening in the U.S. We should see some announcements on their auction in the next couple of weeks. It's super important for us and for Canadians that there's a spectrum that goes to folks besides the big 3. I don't know, Brad, if you want to talk about any other things. I think we'll just probably leave it there. We're..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Non Independent Director   [39]

No, no, we're good

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [40]

We're good. I don't think there's any point in speculating on other things. We're focused on 600, and we think it's an opportunity to level the playing field

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Non Independent Director   [41]

Yes. And we bought a business plan that we're very comfortable with the spectrum position, and it fulfills that. So we're comfortable with the road map we have and where we're going, and we're going to drive to fulfill that

Next question is from Aravinda Galappatthige with Canaccord Genuity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Suranimala Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD   [43]

I just wanted to get an update on the LTE rollout. You've obviously indicated a goal of completing the rollout towards the end of fiscal '17 as well as your capital budget of $250 million. I just wanted to get an update as to how that's tracking, particularly in light of the sort of the management change. Are those goals still very much on track?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [44]

Yes, absolutely on track and ahead of schedule. And so we're pleased with the LTE rollout, and Brian and Zoran and the team are doing a terrific job. And so we're ahead of -- as you know, we're a little bit ahead of the handset ecosystem, which we think is fine. We want to get ready and be prepared, so we launched Toronto and Vancouver proper. We've had great expansion of our Toronto LTE experience, Greater Toronto as we light up throughout the GTA, some other communities in Ontario. Edmonton and Calgary will come on as a big bang. We're not activating sites as we build them. We'll turn them on collectively, and that's going to be in this fiscal year for sure and I think earlier than we originally planned, along with a number of major communities in Ontario. To be clear, in keeping with our plans, there are some smaller communities in Ontario that'll get activated LTE in the next fiscal year, but that's not -- that's just how it was scheduled as a matter of prioritizing resources. So everything's on budget, ahead of schedule, and we're pleased with the LTE rollout

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aravinda Suranimala Galappatthige,  Canaccord Genuity Limited, Research Division - MD   [45]

Awesome. And just a quick one on business infrastructure of ViaWest. Healthy ex FX revenue growth, albeit sort of the recent quarter seemed to suggest that sort of the double-digit growth we've seen in the past has sort of eased towards the mid-single-digit range, particularly, I think, if you factor in the acquisition. I wanted to get a sense of the competitive environment there. I mean, has there been sort of a fundamental change there? And do you expect the possibility of sort of reverting back to high single-digit or double-digit revenue growth there?

Nancy Phillips,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO of ViaWest and President of ViaWest   [46]

Yes. Listen, I would say in general, the -- we live in a -- it's certainly a competitive field, there's no doubt about it. But I think that ViaWest has definitely distinguished itself in terms of the product suite that we've brought to market. Historically, we have certainly seen a very, very low churn rates. We had sort of a point in time single customer sort of noncore last year that certainly bumped our churn rate up a little bit. We've normalized back to our traditional churn rates. We've seen good sequential growth Q1 into Q2. And I'm very confident, if you normalize for that event, you would clearly see that double-digit growth profile. So very confident in terms of trending back to that, and we have very clear line of sight in terms of our churn in our fiscal '17. And again, really strong demand profile. We saw great Q2 bookings. And so feel good about where we're headed here in fiscal '17 on certainly both our revenue and EBITDA position

Next question is from Greg MacDonald with Macquarie

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Gregory W. MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Head of Equity Research of Canada   [48]

Wanted to ask a question on overall promotional strategy. It's pretty clear that there was some in the quarter. And here's the question I have. Is it safe to assume that some of your promotional focus is on customers that are not yet upgrading to BlueSky? Seems like there would be some rationale for this. I mean, they are still customers that are broadband customers that's important to you, might be customers that could upgrade as time goes on. Is it a kind of a 2-part focus, focusing on customers that are upgrading but also customers that do not?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP   [49]

Yes. I mean, maybe Jay can comment on the customer segments a bit, but there's no question that all customers are important to us from that perspective. And there's probably a segment of the market, frankly, that lower segment, Jay, that we've -- maybe haven't been as focused on, and they're important to us. And you're seeing some promotional activity, and -- going against that. And that's obviously helping our overall subscriber numbers, and it's, at the end of the day, revenue we probably didn't otherwise have. Anything else, Jay?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [50]

Yes. I think that's fair. I mean, BlueSky, you're going to see us remain relatively disciplined on BlueSky pricing because it is our future, and we actually don't believe it's a moment in time to heavily discount the product. It's packaged with 150 and service agreements. And it's for people who love broadband and love TV and want a best-in-class experience. And so we're excited about that opportunity, and we're going to compete as our primary competitor does in all of the other spaces. And I think you'll see that going forward

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Gregory W. MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Head of Equity Research of Canada   [51]

Okay. So I'm going to kind of wrap this into the cost question again then. I'm trying to get a sense of how big an impact on the margin the lower gross adds year-over-year was. I want to kind of get a sense of the sustainability of it -- of the margin. It was a high margin in the quarter, higher than I would have expected given the revenue miss that you had. Help me understand what's happening there. Was the lower gross adds a material impact on lower costs? And is there sustainability for that?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP   [52]

Yes. That's a great question, Greg, and we're going to obviously watch that closely. A lot of moving pieces across the board on all of that. A bit of mix shift, like the Internet obviously improving and a bigger component of our revenue base quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year as we move forward, and we know that obviously, Internet has a higher-margin component than video does. So that's a positive. And obviously, we'll monitor going forward. You got to watch the -- there's some timing issues related to some corporate costs and some promotional programs. So I wouldn't get over-the-top excited about a particular margin in the quarter. But overall, I mean, I think stabilizing the Consumer business, moving to a base that we really feel good about continuing to operate as efficiently as possible and being humble in the way we go about things and moving forward on the margin piece is what we're going to be focused on, but a lot of moving pieces

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [53]

And building on that, remember Q2 is really a story of churn reduction, and that's the primary driver. We have continued to see [ clients ] on 150, which is very margin friendly, and we saw some bounce from BlueSky in Calgary and Vancouver. But the Q2 story was primarily churn reduction. If you hear the repositioning of our business going forward, now that our strategy is in place and in market, we're looking for the combination of both churn reduction and additional improvement in sales, which is what I think you'll start to see in Q3. And so it'll be a slightly different margin story as you go forward in the second half of this year. With the growth, I don't think there's anything you won't like about it. But a big part of the Q2 story was churn reduction, and of course, that's very margin friendly

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Gregory W. MacDonald,  Macquarie Research - Head of Equity Research of Canada   [54]

That makes sense. And finally, guys, there was nothing unusual in the costs this quarter on a year-over-year basis comparable, was there? Outside of what we just discussed?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP   [55]

No

(Operator Instructions) The next question is from Maher Yaghi with Desjardins

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Maher Yaghi,  Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division - Analyst   [58]

I wanted to maybe just go back to your comment on wireless. And I mean, we've seen a lot of improvement in Q2 versus Q1 in terms of net adds. How much would you say this improvement due to the new branding that you're doing in the market? And you talked about volatility in wireless net adds. I'm trying to just understand how much of the improvement is due to this launch factor versus a more sustainable and a growth path that we should be looking for. And as a follow-up on the wireless as well, we've seen Quebecor, which is something I would say is very similar to how you would like maybe to undertake your wireless expansion, undertake network sharing agreement in the province of Quebec with Rogers. Can you talk about your view on potential network sharing agreements and if you need to have that for the long term in order to reduce your cost or you can go at it alone?

Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [59]

Yes. So why don't we take that -- there's lots there, Maher, so we'll take it in sequence. In terms of the wireless brand launch, Freedom launch has gone great. It's got terrific recognition, and we wanted to get out in front of creating a brand that's affordability for Canadians. We think affordability matters to Canadians. Whether they live in Calgary with some of the things that are happening here in Alberta or whether they live in Toronto with housing costs or Vancouver with housing costs, there is a space for affordability in the long term. And Freedom is resonating with Canadians for sure. Does all of that sort of weight around a name change create traffic in our stores and [ flex them ]? I think it does. I think actually, there's an argument that the LTE conversion actually slows us down a little bit, that we might have had more success had we stayed simply on the 3G path, continuing to package it at the extremely low end. The conversion to band 66 handsets makes it difficult to bring your own device to our network, and that's just for a moment in time. All the new devices are coming out in band 66, and 2 years from now, it won't matter to people. It will just be table stakes. We're in that process of transition, along with, should I be on LTE? Should I be on 3G? So it's a complicated time, and I think to be clear, at various times, our competitors have taken advantage of this moment in time with their fighter brands primarily but also their flanker brands, and of course, they're all on the same network. And so it's a different game that they are playing. That's where the volatility comes from, is the short-term subscriber results until we get -- we're going to get that Samsung handset here in a couple of weeks. We're going to be in a good Android position by the summer, building on that throughout the fall. I think we'll be in a position where we're much more -- we can have the same confidence on wireless that we have on wireline in terms of month-in, month-out subscriber numbers. Today, there's a little bit more volatility. That having been said, Freedom launch has been a success. We're completely committed to affordability for Canadians, and you'll see that as we move forward. In terms of Quebecor network share, let me say this. The Quebecor model is a fantastic model in terms of the bundle or the quad play, and we've certainly paid attention to that. It's clear to us, you only -- folks that are still around from the original 2008 auction are the folks that were bundled. We understand the Quebecor story, and it's a terrific story. I mean, are we open to having network share conversations and other things? I guess we would be, but none of that is what the business plan is built on. We've got a plan going forward. We're investing, and we've got a significant cost advantage over our competitors as we enter into the market, and we're going to continue to exploit that. So always open, but it's not something that we're working aggressively on today

 David McFadgen,  Cormark Securities Inc., Research Division - Director of Institutional Equity Research   [63]

I have 2 questions. One, can you tell us what the impact was to the Freedom EBITDA from the branding transition in Q2? I don't know if it was anything material. And then secondly, can you give us an update with respect to your intention regarding your initial Corus investment in terms of taking cash dividends or continuing with the DRIP?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP   [64]

Yes. David, I think Brad addressed the first one. In regards to our Corus investment, very happy with what the plan there is and with our holdings and no intention to convert DRIP into cash at this time. In regards to your first question of Freedom EBITDA, there was an impact actually in the quarter in -- related to promotional costs. You heard me reference that in my script. I'd rather stay away from the number, obviously, but a few million dollars for sure. And so -- and I take it back to volatility, right? I mean, you heard us reference volatility as we move forward. Very happy with the business and where we're headed there. You'll see some choppiness obviously on EBITDA as we move forward on the Freedom quarter-to-quarter, but very happy with where it's positioned
