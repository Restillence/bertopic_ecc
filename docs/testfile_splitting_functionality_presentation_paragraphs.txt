Operator   [1]

Good morning, ladies and gentleman, and welcome to the Neuronetics Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Klausner from Westwicke Partners. Sir, you may begin

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mark R. Klausner,  Westwicke Partners, LLC - Managing Partner   [2]

Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Neuronetics' Third Quarter 2018 Conference Call. A replay of this call will be available on our website for 30 days. Joining me on today's call are Neuronetics' Chief Executive Officer, Chris Thatcher; and its Chief Financial Officer, Peter Donato

Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements governed by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements relating to our business strategy, financial and revenue guidance and other operational items and metrics. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business

For a discussion of risks and uncertainties associated with Neuronetics' business, I encourage you to review the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's final prospectus relating to its initial public offering, and the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q that will be filed today

The company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the course of this call, except as required by law

During the call, we will also present certain financial information on a non-GAAP basis, including EBITDA. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures taken in conjunction with U.S. GAAP financial measures provide useful information for both management and investors by excluding certain noncash and other expenses that are not indicative of our core operating results

Management uses non-GAAP measures to compare our performance relative to forecasts and strategic plans to benchmark our performance externally against competitors, and for certain compensation decisions

Reconciliations between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results are presented in tables accompanying our earnings release. Reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the approximate GAAP measures is provided in the company's press release for the quarter, which can be viewed on our website

With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Neuronetics' Chief Executive Officer, Chris Thatcher

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [3]

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'll start by providing an update on our performance during the third quarter followed by an update on the progress we've made towards our key priorities. I will then hand the call over to Peter, who will walk through our financial performance and guidance, after which, we will open the line up to take your questions

The third quarter was very strong, with worldwide revenue growing by 31% over the prior year, and U.S. revenue growing by 30%

Our performance continues to validate the commercial strategy that we have developed and put into place, our ability to execute in a competitive market, and most importantly, the promise of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy's clinical outcomes for patients, which offers a viable alternative for psychiatrists serving their patients with treatment-resistant depression

As we've mentioned on our first call as a public company in August, we have 3 strategic priorities, as we seek to drive growth in our business. As a reminder, the first one is to continue to drive the adoption of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in the U.S. through the expansion of our sales force and the implementation of marketing initiatives

Second, increasing reoccurring treatment session revenue by improving active system utilization by penetrating high-volume single and group practices. And third, make progress towards obtaining reimbursement approval and expanding commercialization in Japan

I would now like to provide an update on the progress we've made on each of these priorities. During the third quarter, we continued to expand our sales force. Our goal for 2018 was to add an incremental 15 BDM territories adding to the 29 BDM territories we had at the start of the year. As a reminder, BDM or Business Development Managers are focused on capital sales

During the first half of the year, we filled 10 of those 15 BDM territories, all of which were active by the end of the second quarter

In the third quarter, we filled 4 of the remaining 5 territories, slightly ahead of plan. And I'm pleased to report that each of those 4 territories are fully trained and active

The plan is to fill the final position in Q4, and with a total of 44 BDM territories at the end of the fourth quarter and going into 2019, we believe we can continue to grow growth in the active installed base into the future. We anticipate the continued expansion of our BDM territories in 2019

We're very excited with the quality of the salespeople we've been able to attract, and we believe it speaks to the significant market opportunity for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy

We have developed a proven sales strategy as demonstrated by consistent growth, both as a private and a public company. However, I felt we could and can do better. To help drive our ongoing commercial execution, we created a Chief Commercial Officer role in the second quarter to manage our larger and expanding sales and marketing teams, and manage the day-to-day commercial operations. This role oversees approximately 130 people across a variety of functions, including sales, marketing, reimbursement and customer support

Shifting gears to our marketing initiatives. As we mentioned on our last call, during the second quarter, we launched a national TV advertising campaign aimed at raising patient awareness that NeuroStar Advanced Therapy can treat major depressive disorder, should anti-depression medications not work for them. All of our website metrics were up significantly, immediately following the launch of the TV ads, and we believe that at least some of the uptick in treatment session revenue during the middle part of the year was due to the TV ads

In addition to driving sales, another goal of these ads were to further develop the NeuroStar brand and increase the awareness of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy among major depressive disorder patients, their families and friends, as well as psychiatrists and physicians

Based on the success of the initial TV ads, we have decided to launch another round of TV ads during the [first] quarter, in order to continue to increase treatment session revenue and brand awareness

As some of you may know, October was Depression Awareness Month. In conjunction with our ongoing marketing efforts, we launched additional PR, online interviews and televised satellite tour designed to increase national awareness and to educate the public on NeuroStar Advanced Therapy as an innovative depression treatment option, while sparking a much-needed dialogue on breaking the stigma associated with mental health. The satellite tour was picked up by tens of TV stations across the country

During October, the company hit a milestone as the 2 millionth NeuroStar Advanced Therapy treatment session was delivered. It is incredibly rewarding to be part of a company that has transformed so many lives and continues to do so every day

We remain focused on providing hope to those who need it most, and make sure as many people as possible know about this proven treatment, not just during national Depression Awareness Month, but throughout the year

Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, the company attended the 31st Annual U.S. Psychiatric and Mental Health Congress, more commonly known as the Psych Congress held in Orlando

While at the Congress, we hosted a context-sensing challenge, which allowed attendees to witness how easy it can be for a TMS System to lose contact with a patient during a treatment session, especially when the system lacks the ability to monitor a patient's positioning

The smallest movement by the patient during treatment can result in a dramatic loss in the prescribed treatment dose. Even a 1-millimeter movement of the head away from the coil can result in a 40% loss of the prescribed treatment dose. Our patented continuous contact sensing solves this problem. NeuroStar is the only TMS System in the market that provides contact sensing technology, to deliver the right dose to the right location every time to treat depression and maximize a patient's chance of achieving remission

We believe that this allows for precise and reproducible treatments for each and every patient. This is just one example of how we have developed our market-leading position

Turning to our initiatives to drive reoccurring treatment session revenue. On our last call, we discussed our strategy to introduce and integrate the CTC or the Clinical Training Consultant

During the second quarter, we hit our 2018 target of hiring and training 9 CTCs. The CTC position was created to allow the CPC or the Clinical Practice Consultant to focus on driving pull-through rather than spending time training and onboarding new practices

While we are seeing accelerating revenues or volume increases for treatment sessions, it's too early to disaggregate and attribute that increase directly to this initiative. However, there has clearly been a positive improvement to utilization. So we're encouraged that the combination of all of our strategies, the BDM expansion, the CTC integration, high-volume, target account focus and market efforts -- marketing efforts are driving growth in the business, and have set the stage to continue our success in the fourth quarter and into 2019

As Peter will discuss in more detail, we have seen a significant uptick in treatment session volume year-over-year. This is being driven both by the increase in the active installed base, and an increase in the utilization per system. Much of this increase is due to the execution of our HVT strategy, as we see these practices performing at higher volumes. This speaks to the market demand for our therapy and the ability of motivated providers to attract patients

As it relates to our product pipeline, we had a successful launch of our next-generation TrakStar practice management system during the second quarter. Early feedback has been very positive, as practitioners have commented on the fact that they really like the cloud-based data management system, because they are able to better monitor system usage real-time across their existing offices along with employee usage of the system in order to increase efficiency across their network

Lastly, we continue to make good progress towards achieving reimbursement in Japan by the end of 2018. During the second quarter, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare or MHLW accepted our submission for reimbursement. Since that time we have had very positive interactions with MHLW. We currently expect that our reimbursement code will be decided in the December of 2018, and published in March of 2019, at which point, we can commence commercial efforts

In advance of the anticipated decision on reimbursement, our partner in Japan, Teijin Pharmaceuticals has been working diligently on market development efforts to be prepared to launch

In order to do so, they have focused on sales rep training, physician training, and the establishment of key reference sites. Teijin has made a significant investment in sales force education in order to have 100% of their reps fully trained on selling NeuroStar Advanced Therapy

They've also been very proactive in getting physicians trained, both on the science of TMS in general as well as the benefits of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy

Year-to-date, 150 providers have gone through the general science training on TMS and about half have now completed NeuroStar Advanced Therapy training, and the remainder are on track to be completed by year-end. These trainings have been very well attended, and there continues to be high demand for future events with an upcoming January 2019 TMS training session already fully booked with 150 physicians

Teijin's free commercialization activities are well on their way. They're establishing key sites throughout Japan to allow as many prospective accounts as possible to interact with the NeuroStar system and speak with KOLs on the treatment. We will continue to provide updates on our progress in Japan, as key milestones are achieved

I would now like to turn the call over to Peter for a financial review. Peter?

Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP &amp; CFO   [4]

Thanks, Chris. Total revenue for the quarter was $13.7 million, a 31% increase over the prior year quarter. U.S. revenue was $13.5 million, an increase of 30% over the third quarter of 2017

OUS revenue was approximately $220,000, an increase of 135% versus the prior year period. The increase in OUS revenue was primarily a function of milestone payments as well as a small number of treatment session sales to our Japanese distributor. You should be aware that the milestone payments in Japan of $2.75 million collected to date are being amortized over the life of the contract

U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenue was $3.9 million during the third quarter, a 38% increase over the prior year

As a reminder, NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenue primarily consists of revenue from capital sales, but also includes revenue from coils, rentals and upgrades. Capital revenue grew 58% driven by higher volume during the period as a result of our ongoing sales force expansion and marketing initiatives

In addition, we saw a 1% increase in average selling price as compared to the prior year period. These positive trends were partially offset by lower upgrade, rentals and other related revenue in the quarter

During the quarter, we saw our active installed-base increase to 858 units, a net increase of 42 units from June 30, 2018, and an increase of 133 units from September 30, 2017

Keep in mind, we define an active unit as a NeuroStar unit that was either purchased or rented during the quarter or one which has ordered NeuroStar treatment sessions during the last 12 months

U.S. Treatment session revenue was $9.2 million for the third quarter of 2018, an increase of 28% over the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to an approximate 31% increase in treatment sessions purchased, plus a 3% increase in other treatment session revenue. This was partially offset by an approximate 6% decline in treatment session ASPs

This pricing decline was slightly higher than our expectations due to the success of our HVT strategy, which has resulted in higher realization of volume pricing discounts that we provide to customers, who perform a significant number of procedures as Chris talked about earlier

U.S. service and other revenue was approximately $400,000, a 15% increase as a result of our expanded active installed base

Gross profit for the third quarter of 2018 was $10.7 million, an increase of $2.8 million from $7.9 million during the third quarter of 2017. Gross margin for the third quarter of 2018 was 77.9%, which was higher than the third quarter of 2017 gross margin of 74.9%

The improvement in gross margin was driven by increased leverage on our field service and operations cost as a result of higher year-over-year total revenues, which were slightly offset by lower international NeuroStar sales. While we are starting to see operating leverage and expect to see a benefit from that in the future, we do not expect to see such a significant year-over-year uptick going forward. As a reminder, we continue to drive gross margins toward the mid-70% range for 2018

Sales and marketing expenses for the third quarter of 2018 were $9.7 million, an increase of $3.1 million over the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to costs associated with the expansion of our sales force, as well as additional marketing efforts

General administrative expenses were $3.2 million, an increase of about $1 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher expenses as a result of being a public company

Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2018 were $2.1 million, an increase of approximately $300,000 from the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to continued investment in advanced development projects, partially offset by lower spending on clinical studies

Net loss for the third quarter was $5 million, compared to a net loss of $3.8 million in the third quarter of 2017

EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure for the third quarter of 2018 was a loss of $3.8 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $2.8 million in the third quarter of 2017, for all the reasons cited previously

Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $106.8 million compared to $14.5 million at June 30, 2018 and $29.1 million at year-end 2017. Cash usage during the quarter was in line with our expectations

As a reminder, on July 2, 2018, we closed our IPO in which we issued and sold 6.325 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $17 per share. We received net proceeds of $96.5 million after deducting all operating expenses, which given the timing of our offering was not reflected in our GAAP reported cash number at the end of Q2

Turning to guidance. For the full year 2018, we now expect total worldwide revenue of between $51 million and $52.5 million, representing growth in the range of 26% to 30% over the prior year. This is an increase over our previous guidance range of $50 million to $51.5 million

I will now hand the call back over to Chris

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [5]

Thank you, Peter. We had very strong third quarter. We were able to grow revenue by 31%, as we continue to sell more NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems, while at the same time driving greater pull-through within these placements

This exceptional growth has come as a result of focused efforts on the long-term commercial strategy that we put in place, in combination with the development of our industry-leading TMS technology for the treatment of drug resistant-depression. We're very excited about the future at Neuronetics. Looking at the remainder of 2018 and 2019, we will continue to work diligently to bring NeuroStar Advanced Therapy to an even greater number of psychiatrists and their patients. With that, I'd like to open the line for questions

Operator   [1]

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Neuronetics Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded

I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Mark Klausner from Westwicke. Sir, you may begin

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mark R. Klausner,  Westwicke Partners, LLC - Managing Partner   [2]

With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Neuronetics' Chief Executive Officer, Chris Thatcher

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [3]

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'll start by providing an update on our performance during the fourth quarter and the full year 2018, followed by an update on the progress we made towards our key priorities. I'll then hand the call over to Peter to walk through our financial performance and guidance for Q1 and 2019, after which we will discuss our priorities for 2019 before opening up the line to take your questions

Overall, the fourth quarter was very strong as we continued to drive the adoption of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. Total revenue was $15.6 million, an increase of 29% over the prior year, largely driven by 37% growth in U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy revenue and 23% growth in U.S. treatment session revenue

For the full year of 2018, total revenue was $52.8 million, an increase of 31% over the prior year. We are proud of what we've been able to accomplish in 2018. Our performance demonstrates our ability to execute on our strategy to drive the adoption of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy and maintain our market leadership position. We've continued to see strong growth in a number of psychiatric practices utilizing our therapy, which, we believe, is driven by our ability to offer a clinically proven therapy that is both user- and patient-friendly, while at the same time providing world-class training, practice support and service

Shifting gears to an update on our operating performance. As we outlined last year, we have three strategic priorities as we seek to drive growth in the business: As a reminder, the first was to continue to drive the adoption of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in the U.S. through the expansion of our sales force and the implementation of marketing initiatives. Second, increase recurrent treatment session revenue by improving active system utilization by penetrating high-volume single group practice. And third, make progress towards obtaining reimbursement approval and commercialization in Japan

So taking each of these in order. During the fourth quarter, we continued to expand our sales force. Our goal for 2018 was to add an incremental 15 BDM territories on top of the 29 BDM territories which were active at the beginning of 2018. As a reminder, the BDMs are Business Development Managers who are focused on driving capital sales. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, we filled 14 of the 15 BDM territories, and we filled the last BDM territory in the fourth quarter, bringing our total to 44 at the end of the year. We're very pleased with how these recently hired reps have been able to get up to speed with their hiring and productivity being slightly ahead of our internal modeling

During the fourth quarter, we continued to utilize TV advertising campaigns to help increase patient awareness of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy and ultimately drive increased utilization. We ran our second national DTC campaign of the year in October and November. Leveraging the learnings from our initial campaign, we optimized our strategy to more effectively target potential patients. We saw strong lifts in many key return metrics, including website traffic and lead generation, which is characterized as position locator usage, click-to-call usage and appointments generated, which we're very pleased with. While we view this as a very successful campaign, we did learn that there is an opportunity to improve our customers' conversion rates or converting an interested patient into an active patient. What we learned is that in order to convert a patient, the psychiatric office must respond within a very narrow window of time, following the potential patient's initial outreach, after which, conversion metrics declined significantly. As we look into the future marketing campaigns, we will work with our customers to help take advantage of this opportunity

Part of our strategy to drive and improve system utilization was the addition of the CTC, or Clinical Training Consultant, in 2019. We hired 9 CTCs in the first half of 2018 to help more quickly onboard new accounts and allow for the CPC to focus on working with psychiatrists and practices to successfully treat patients and drive increased utilization. Given our recent BDM expansion, we felt the CTC addition will be critical in order to keep up with the new customer training. In the second half of the year, we were able to see an overall improvement and pull-through as systems were able to begin treating patients more quickly at a higher rate than in previous years. I'm very proud of the commercial organization that we have been able to build over the last few years and specifically, the progress we made in 2018. We've developed and grown a highly sophisticated, deeply integrated commercial infrastructure which encompasses sales, marketing, reimbursement and customer support. I look forward to leveraging what we built to continue to drive adoption for years to come

Moving to Japan. As we announced in January, we believe a decision on reimbursement will occur in the second half of 2019 and remain enthusiastic on the opportunity to bring our product to a country that would so greatly benefit. This shift in timeline came as a result of discussions we had with the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare during the fourth quarter. The shift was largely driven by routine trade-off decisions involving reimbursement rates and the breadth of provider access. In anticipation of the reimbursement decision, we have continued to work with our partner in Japan, Teijin Pharmaceuticals, on market development efforts ahead of an official launch. Teijin remains a committed partner. They've invested millions of dollars to establish and develop a fully dedicated division within the company focused on the eventual commercial launch in NeuroStar Advanced Therapy throughout Japan

I would now like to turn the call over to Peter to review our financial results

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP of Finance &amp; CFO   [4]

Thanks, Chris. Total revenue for the quarter was $15.6 million, a 29% increase over the prior year quarter. U.S. revenue was $15.1 million, an increase of 27% over the fourth quarter of 2017. OUS revenue was approximately $550,000, an increase of 101% versus the prior year period. The increase in OUS revenue was primarily a function of NeuroStar system sales in Japan as well as the ongoing amortization of milestone payments from our Japanese partner

U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue was $4.8 million during the fourth quarter, a 37% increase over the prior year. As a reminder, NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue primarily consists of revenue from capital sales, but also includes revenue from system upgrades to allow our NeuroStar systems to perform 19-minute treatment sessions. Capital sales revenue grew 46%, driven by higher unit sales volume during the period as a result of our ongoing sales force expansion and continued marketing initiatives. This was partially offset by a 4% decrease in average selling price as compared to the prior year period. The positive trends in capital sales volume and revenue were partially offset by lower upgrades for the 19-minute treatment session in 2018 versus 2017

During the quarter, we saw our active installed base increase to 907 units, a net increase of 49 units from the third quarter of 2018 and an increase of 155 units from year-end 2017. Keep in mind, we define an active unit as a NeuroStar unit that was placed in service during the quarter or one that ordered treatment sessions during the last 12 months

U.S. treatment sessions revenue's was $9.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, an increase of 23% over the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to an approximate 26% increase in treatment sessions purchased as well as a 3% increase in other treatment session revenue. This was partially offset by just under a 6% decline in treatment session ASPs due to predetermined volume pricing discounts within our existing customer base, which are triggered when those customers surpass certain predefined high-volume thresholds. U.S. service and other revenue was approximately $400,000, a 21% increase as a result of our expanded installed base

Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $11.9 million, an increase of $2.8 million from $9.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 76.3%, which was higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 gross margin of 75.6%. The improvement in gross margin was driven by increased leverage on our service and operations areas

Sales and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2018 were $10.6 million, an increase of $2 million over the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the increased size of our sales force and the spending on our marketing campaigns. General and administrative expenses were $4.7 million, an increase of about $1.9 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased costs related to being a public company. Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2018 were $2.2 million, an increase of approximately $300,000 from the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel and product development costs related to the commencement of our next-generation platform design

Net loss for the fourth quarter was $6.1 million compared to a net loss of $4.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, for the fourth quarter of 2018 was a loss of $5 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017

Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $104.6 million compared to $106.8 million at the end of the third quarter of 2018 and $29.1 million at year-end 2017. Cash usage during the quarter was in line with our expectations

Turning to guidance. For the full year 2019, we expect total worldwide revenue of between $62.5 million and $64.5 million, representing approximately 18% and 22% year-over-year growth, respectively. For the full year 2019, we expect gross margins to be in the mid-70s range, in line with full year 2018 margins and previous guidance. For the full year of 2019, we expect operating expenses to be between $71.5 million and $76.5 million, primarily due to continued investment in our sales force expansion efforts, research and development related to the development of our next-generation NeuroStar platform and clinical spending as we pursue additional indications for use, namely PTSD and Bi-Polar disorders

For the first quarter of 2019, we expect total worldwide revenue of between $12.4 million and $13 million, representing 22% and 28% year-over-year growth, respectively

I'll now turn the call back over to Chris. Chris?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [5]

Thanks, Peter. As we look to 2019, our primary focus is driving the continued adoption of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy and bringing relief to the greatest number of patients possible. I'm pleased to note that our year is off to a good start. In particular, at the recent CTMS and Brain Stimulation Conference, we saw significant booth traffic which led to strong lead generation

As we continue to drive growth in 2019, our strategic priorities are as follows: First, continue the expansion of our sales force and related marketing efforts; second, continue the focus on driving long-term increases in system utilization; third, the continuing development of our next-generation NeuroStar system; fourth, beginning the clinical work to set the stage for the expansion into new indications; and lastly, launch NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in Japan and selectively evaluate entry into other international markets

Taking each of these in order, beginning with the continued expansion of our sales force and related marketing efforts. In 2019, our goal is to add an incremental 15 BDM territories, bringing our total to 59 by the end of the year. We continue to be very excited about the quality of the salespeople we're able to attract, and we feel very confident that we can continue to drive predictable growth in new system sales and subsequent pull-through as a result

In addition to the expansion of our sales force, we will continue to utilize DTC marketing campaigns throughout the year. We launched multiple campaigns during 2018, each of which allowed us to drive greater insight into the most effective ways to turn a viewer of a television ad into a patient undergoing treatment for MDD with NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. We believe that further investments will pay dividends in the form of increased patient awareness, lead generation, system sales and, ultimately, system utilization. We plan to continue to test and retest the DTC campaign in 2019. We will provide periodic updates on the details around the campaign throughout the year

Moving on to driving long-term increases in system utilization. In line with our BDM expansion and recent new system installation growth, we're also going to be adding both CPCs and CTCs throughout the year. Part of our value proposition to psychiatrists is being be able to help onboard, train and grow our practices' use of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. We plan -- our plan is to add an incremental 5 CPCs and 6 CTCs during the year, bringing the total number of CPCs to 33 and the total number of CTCs to 15 by the end of the year

Another of our strategic priorities is the development and future launch of our next-generation NeuroStar system. We are in the beginning of a multiyear process to create the next-generation NeuroStar system. As good as the system is today in meeting patients' or providers' needs, we feel it could be even better. As we prepare for the natural replacement cycle for NeuroStar systems, we're committed to maintaining our industry leadership position by continually advancing the capabilities of our system for use in both clinical and research settings. On the clinical front, we're building out our clinical science team in advance of planned discussions later this year with the FDA on clinical trials for PTSD and Bi-Polar. We believe that both of these indications represent large and underserved market opportunities that are complementary to our existing call points. Based on our initial exploration, we believe that the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system may be an effective treatment for patients suffering from these conditions

Our last strategic priority is prudently expanding our global footprint. It's estimated that there are over 300 million MDD patients globally, the significant majority of which reside outside the U.S. While our near-term focus is in Japan, we are planning to explore additional commercial expansions very selectively in Europe, in Asia in the second half of this year. We expect to receive a reimbursement decision in Japan in the second half of 2019, and we'll continue to work with our partner in Japan to be ready to launch quickly after the decision is finalized. As a reminder, there are currently no commercial revenues from Japan included in our guidance

We're very excited about the future of Neuronetics and look forward to updating you on our progress in future quarters

And with that, I'd like now to open up the line for questions

 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [3]

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'll start by providing an update on our performance during the first quarter followed by an update in the progress we made towards our key priorities. I'll then hand the call over to Peter to walk through our financial performance and guidance for Q2 and 2019. After which, we will provide our closing remarks before opening up the line to take the questions

The first quarter was a good start to the year as we continue to drive the adoption of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. Total revenue was $12.7 million, an increase of 25% over the prior year; primarily driven by 41% growth in the U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy revenue and 21% growth in U.S. treatment session revenue. Our growth continues to validate our strategy, our ability to execute and NeuroStar Advanced Therapy's proven clinical outcomes for patients, which offers a viable alternative for psychiatrists serving their patients with treatment resistant depression

On our fourth quarter call, we laid out our focus for the year which was to drive the adoption of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. In order to do so, we provided a list of our strategic priorities for 2019. As a reminder, these priorities are to continue the expansion of our sales force and marketing efforts, focus on driving long-term increases in system utilization, development of our next generation NeuroStar system, begin the clinical work to set the stage for the expansion of new indications and launch NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in Japan and selectively evaluate and treat into other international markets

Taking each of these in order, as we look to continue the expansion of our sales force and related marketing efforts in 2019, our goal is to add an incremental 15 BDM territories bringing our total to 59 by the end of the year. In the first quarter, we filled four of those territories, all of which are all fully trained and active. We continue to be very excited about the quality of the salespeople we're able to attract and we feel very confident that we can continue to drive predictable growth in new system sales and subsequent treatment session pull-through as a result

In addition to the expansion of our sales force, we continued to utilized DTC marketing campaigns. In 2018, we launched multiple campaigns at turning a viewer of a television ad into a patient undergoing treatment with NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. Each of these campaigns provided greater insight into the most effective way to increase patient awareness, generate leads for the practice and ultimately drive system utilization

In our most recently completed campaign, we gained further insight into campaign frequency, ad duration and the importance of the speed of practice follow-up. Leveraging those learnings and with a focus on effectively managing the patients-psychiatrist touch point, we launched a nationwide TV ad campaign at the end of the first quarter. The results we have seen so far have been excellent with significant increases in Web traffic, appointment requests and patient conversions which improved the overall cost per patient conversion

At this stage, we know that we have optimized our marketing spend to get a patient to contact a psychiatrist. We're optimistic that with each iteration we will continue to create increased demand at the more efficient rate and improve our ability to convert patients who respond to the TV campaign

Our second strategic priority for the year is to drive long-term utilization increases. As we have noted previously, we will continue to increase the number of CPC's, or clinical practice consultants, and CTC's, or clinical training consultants in order to maximize the utility of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy for our customers and patients

Our goal for 2019 is to add an incremental five CPC's and an additional six CTC's to keep up with new system sales and optimize the CPC's territories based on the uneven distribution of system sales in 2018. During the first quarter, we hired all five of the CPC's and five of the six CTC's slightly ahead of our expectations for the year

Another one of our strategic priorities is the development and future launch of our next generation NeuroStar system. We're in the early stages of a multi-year process to create the next iteration of NeuroStar system. During the first quarter, we continue to drive towards that goal as we look to maintain our industry leadership position by continuingly advancing the capabilities of our system from use in both clinical and research settings. This initiative starts with our voice of customer and fundamental research and I'm pleased to share that we've completed that and we've begun our product development process. Our fourth strategic priority for 2019 is to begin the clinical work to set the stage for expansion of indications for use for the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system. Our current focus is the build-out of our clinical science team and advance of planned discussions later this year with the FDA on clinical trials on PTSD and bipolar. This team is building out nicely and I'm pleased with the talent we're brining into this function. Our final strategic priority for the year is the prudent expansion of our global footprint. Our near-term focus is on the commercial launch in Japan. As announced in March, Japan's Central Social Insurance Medial Council has approved the recommendation by Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare to provide reimbursement for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy

The reimbursement is expected to go into effect on or about June 1, 2019. Obtaining reimbursement approval in Japan, a single-payer health care system, is a critical milestone that facilitates psychiatrists and facilities implementing NeuroStar Advanced Therapy into their treatment continuum to provide a much needed and affordable treatment alternative for MDD patients

The initial reimbursement approval for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy is expected to cover patients treated at approximately 160 of the largest in-patient and outpatient psychiatric facilities with the most comprehensive mental health services in Japan. The reimbursement rate at these facilities will be 12,000 Japanese yen per session. Initially, Teijin Pharmaceuticals, our distribution partner, will have the ability to market to the largest in-patient and out-patient centers in Japan which aligns with our market segmentation and go-to-market strategy. As of today, approximately 38 doctors from the qualifying facilities have been trained. As part of the product approval process, a physician needs to be trained by both the [JSPN] and by Teijin

While the level of reimbursement didn't come in lower than the U.S., we're comfortable that this level supports commercializing the product in Japan. I would note, that there is a process for us to collect clinical and economic data in a Japanese market subsequent to the launch that we will utilize over the next few years to try to potentially increase both the level of reimbursement as well as increase the number of facilities Teijin can sell to. While we remain enthusiastic about the Japanese market, we do not anticipate material revenue in 2019 but anticipate that revenue will grow in 2020 and beyond as Teijin sales and marketing efforts mature. Overall, we're very excited about the progress we made in the first quarter and our ability to continue to drive strong top-line growth in the business and maintain our market leadership position

I would now like to hand the call over to Peter to discuss our financial performance

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter L. Donato,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CFO, VP &amp; Corporate Secretary   [4]

Thanks, Chris. Total revenue for the quarter was $12.7 million, a 25% increase over the prior year quarter. U.S. revenue was $12.5 million, an increase of 26% over the first quarter of 2018. Outside the U.S. revenue was approximately $182,000, an increase of 1% versus the prior year period. U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue for the first quarter of 2019 was $3.4 million, an increase of 41% over the first quarter 2018 revenue of $2.4 million. The increase in U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue was primarily driven by higher capital in rent-to-own revenue. Capital units increased by 42% while average selling prices declined by 8% as compared to last year

On a sequential quarterly basis, average selling prices for capital sales were up approximately one-half of one point. During the quarter, we saw our active install base increase to 931 units, a net increase of 150 units from the first quarter of 2018; and an increase of 24 units from year-end 2018. Please note that we had an atypical number of systems go inactive during the first quarter related to a single large customer who had to return a group of their systems and these were pulled out of the active installed base

U.S. treatment session revenue was $8.8 million for the first quarter of 2019, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to an approximate 18% increase in treatment sessions purchased as well as an increase in other treatment session revenue. This was partially offset by a 3% decline in treatment session ASP's, due to predetermined volume pricing discounts within our existing customer base. This is in line with expectations and these discounts are triggered when customers surpass certain predefined high volume thresholds

U.S. service and other revenue was approximately $418,000, a 16% increase as a result of our expanded install base. Gross profit for the first quarter of 2019 was $9.9 million, an increase of $2.2 million from $7.7 million during the first quarter of 2018. Gross margin for the first quarter of 2019 was 77.9%, which was higher than the first quarter of 2018 gross margin of 75.8%. The majority of the increase in gross margin was the result of increased leverage on our service and operations cost as a result of higher sales compared to the prior year period

Sales and marketing expenses for the first quarter of 2019 were $9.6 million, an increase of a million and a half dollars over the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the increased size of our sales force spending on our marketing campaigns in support of a larger install base. General administrative expenses were $4.6 million, an increase of about $2 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by increased cost related to being a public company as well as legal and tax charges. Research and development expenses for the first quarter of 2019 were $2.8 million, an increase of approximately $1.2 million from the prior year period

The increase was primarily due to higher personnel and product development costs related to the commencement of our next generation platform. Net loss for the first quarter was $7.5 million, compared to a net loss of $5.5 million in the first quarter of 2018. EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure for the first quarter of 2019, was a loss of $6.4 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2018

Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalence of $96.1 million, compared to $104.6 million at year-end 2018. Cash usage during the quarter was in line with our expectations. Turning to guidance, for the full year 2019, we are reiterating our guidance of total worldwide revenue of between $62.5 million and $64.5 million, representing approximately 18% and 22% year-over-year growth respectively

For the full year 2019, we continue to expect gross margins to be in the mid 70's range, in line with full-year 2018 margins in our previous guidance. For the full year 2019, we continue to expect operating expenses to be between $71.5 million and $76.5 million primarily due to continued investment in our sales force expansion efforts, marketing, research and development related to the development of our next generation NeuroStar platform and clinical spending as we pursue additional indications; mainly PTSD and bipolar disorders

For the second quarter of 2019, we expect total worldwide revenue between $15.6 million and $16.2 million representing 18% and 22% year-over-year growth respectively. I'll now turn the call back over to Chris. Chris?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [5]

Thanks, Peter. 2019 is off to a great start as we continue to drive strong revenue growth and enable a greater number of patients to get treatment using NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. The sustained growth is a direct reflection of our ability to successfully execute in a long-term commercial strategy that we put in place in combination with the development of our industry-leading NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system for the treatment of drug-resistant depression

We're very excited about the future at Neuronetics. With that, I'd like now to open up the line for questions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [3]

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. Before I get started, I'd like to welcome Steve Furlong, Neuronetics' new Chief Financial Officer. Steve brings extensive medical device experience to the team, most notably having spent 14 years at Hologic, where he held a variety of senior leadership positions. We're very excited to have Steve on board as we look to continue to drive the adoption of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy and expand our market leadership position

On today's call, I will provide an update on our performance during the second quarter, followed by an update on the progress we made towards our key priorities. I'll then hand the call over to Steve to walk through our financial performance and guidance for Q3 and 2019, after which we will provide our closing remarks before opening up the line to take your questions

Our strong performance continued in the second quarter. Total revenue was $16.6 million, an increase of 25% over the prior year, primarily driven by a 30% growth in the U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy revenue and a 22% growth in U.S. Treatment Session revenue. This represents the fifth consecutive quarter since becoming a public company that we've delivered top line growth in excess of 20%

Moving on to an update on our strategic priorities for the year. As a reminder, these priorities are to continue the expansion of our sales force and marketing efforts, focus on driving long-term increases in system utilization, launching NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in Japan and selectively evaluate entry into other international markets; develop our next-generation NeuroStar system and beginning the clinical work to set the stage for the expansion of new indications

Taking each of these in order. As we look to continue the expansion of our sales force and related marketing efforts in 2019, our goal is to bring our total BDM territories to 59 by the end of the year. This will be an incremental 15 BDMs versus the end of 2018. In the second quarter, we filled an additional territory, making that 5 new territories year-to-date, bringing our current BDM territory count to 49. We continue to be very excited about the quality of the salespeople we're able to attract, and we feel very confident that we can continue to drive predictable growth in new system sales and subsequent treatment session pull-through result

We have also expanded our regional sales management infrastructure by adding 2 new BDM regions and associated regional manager. This brings the total number of sales regions to 7 as we scale to support our future growth

In addition to the expansion of our sales force, we continue to utilize DTC marketing campaigns. We finished another round of TV commercials that ran from May 13 to June 1. Following this round of commercials, web traffic was up 72% versus the previous 3 weeks without TV commercials. During this beta test, we had a new functionality to our website. Patients who responded to the ad could book an appointment on the line directly with a provider or talk live with a nurse, who could then book qualified patients an appointment. This feature was designed to increase the lead-to-consult conversion. I'm pleased to report that we saw positive trends

And comparing our cost per lead in the most recent television campaign against a similar 3-week television campaign in the fall of 2018, we generated a 5.6 reduction in our cost per lead. We're continuing to assess the financial merits of this program and further ways to continue to improve conversion of leads and the appropriate mix in our marketing strategy

As we continue to focus on driving adoption and utilization of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy, we continue to evaluate different pricing models to drive both system and treatment session sales. One such program we have utilized in certain situations is fixed-price treatment session model. The interest in this program has picked up recently, particularly as we've continued to be successful in penetrating high-volume accounts that have the resources and patient volume to drive future growth in their practice, either by adding additional systems or opening up new locations

Our second strategic priority for the year is to drive long-term utilization increases. As we've noted previously, we will continue to increase the number of CPCs, or Clinical Practice Consultants, and CTCs, or Clinical Training Consultants, in order to maximize the utilization of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy for our customers and patients

As of the end of the quarter, we're happy to share that we have already met our goal of hiring incremental 5 CPCs and 6 CTCs in 2019. This brings the total to 29 CPCs and 15 CTCs. To date, we've installed nearly 1,000 systems and once installed, our primary focus is to ensure that clinicians are well trained to optimize NeuroStar Therapy for patients by utilizing the system proprietary, patented features, including contact sensing and the 6-point alignment system. We believe that our highly trained CTCs and CPC teams are a key strategic advantage for us and that our focus on training in practice management enables our customers to effectively and consistently deliver the outcomes we generated in our clinical trials to their patients

We announced in July that the NeuroStar Outcomes Registry has passed 3,000 evaluable patients, making it now the largest registry focused on therapies for the treatment of depression. The Outcomes Registry includes data from 100 clinical practice sites across the United States and showed that 63% of patients treated with NeuroStar Advanced Therapy experienced significant improvement in the depression symptoms. This demonstrates real-world outcomes consistent results seen in the Carpenter open-label clinical trial, in which 58% of the patients experienced significant improvement. Importantly, safety data reported in our registry is also consistent with the findings of previously conducted clinical trials

Our third strategic priority for the year is the prudent expansion of our global footprint. Our initial expansion market is Japan. Earlier this year, we announced that NeuroStar Advanced therapy received national reimbursement in Japan, which went into effect on June 1. This is a tremendous achievement, and we'll provide psychiatry as a very important option to treat patients with MDD in a country that has one of the highest suicide rates in the world

We're very excited to announce that we launched commercial in Japan in the second quarter and encouraged with our early progress. The first patient was treated with NeuroStar Advanced therapy last month. Our partner Tiejin is targeting the leading teaching hospitals to the largest inpatient and outpatient clinics in Japan. The initial feedback that they provided is very encouraging. The June JSPN training course was once again filled to capacity of 150 participants. So far in 2019, over 50 additional doctors have completed Tiejin's subsequent NeuroStar TMS-specific training. In addition, a 30-minute documentary aired nationally, featuring TMS as a new technology in mid-July. Subsequent to this, Tiejin received a number of calls from hospitals, clinics and patients requesting more information

Overall, Tiejin is off to a good start in this targeted segment. And you can see in the second quarter, our OUS revenues are up nicely as a result of the most recent round of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system sales to Tiejin

Another of our strategic priorities is the development and future launch of our next-generation NeuroStar system. We're in the early stages of a multiyear process. And in second quarter, we continue to drive towards that goal. We've met with patients and physician focus groups to gain their feedback on how to improve the reproducibility, precision and efficiency of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. These insights are informing our priorities as we develop our next-generation TMS system

Our final strategic priority for 2019 is to begin the clinical work to set the stage for the expansion of indications for the use of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system. We're excited about the therapeutic opportunities that PTSD and bipolar indications will bring to our existing providers, new providers and patients globally. These are disorders that impact a significant population in the U.S. and like depression are difficult-to-treat with pharmacotherapy. We believe that in our current installed base alone, there are thousands of patients who suffer with these diseases that could potentially benefit from NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. We're currently on track to have discussions with the FDA later this year to inform our regulatory strategy. We're progressing very well against these important initiatives, which will support a continued long-term growth

Overall, we're very excited about our results in the second quarter and how we have positioned ourselves to continue to drive strong top line growth in the business and build upon our market leadership position

I would now like to hand the call over to Steve to discuss our financial performance

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CFO &amp; Company Secretary   [4]

Thanks, Chris. Before providing the financial update, I would like to say how excited I am to join the Neuronetics' team and help realize the mission of improving the quality of life for patients who suffer from psychiatric disorders. Neuronetics has a well-defined leadership position in the TMS space and the track record of growth is truly impressive. In addition, there is still a significant untapped market for TMS, both for the treatment of MDD as well as other psychiatric disorders. And I look forward to being a part of Neuronetics as we continue to advance NeuroStar Advanced Therapy to treat these patients

Now shifting gears to our financial update. Total revenue for the quarter was $16.6 million, a 25% increase over the prior year quarter. U.S. revenue was $15.9 million, an increase of 23% over the second quarter of 2018. International revenue was approximately $682,000, an increase of 93% versus the prior year period due primarily to the sale of systems to our distribution partner in Japan

U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue for the second quarter of 2019 was $4.6 million, an increase of 30% over the second quarter 2018 revenue of $3.6 million. The increase in U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue was primarily driven by higher capital, upgrades and rent-to-own revenue. Capital units sold increased by 26%, while average selling prices declined by 9% as compared to last year. On a sequential basis, average selling prices declined by 4%

During the quarter, we saw our active installed base increase to 976 units, a net increase of 160 units from the second quarter of 2018 and an increase of 45 units from first quarter 2019

U.S. Treatment Session revenue was $10.8 million for the second quarter of 2019, an increase of 22% over the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to an approximate 24% increase in the number of treatment sessions sold and an increase in other treatment session revenue. The increase in treatment sessions purchased was partially offset by a 7% decline in treatment session ASPs due to predetermined volume pricing discounts within our existing customer base. This is in line with expectations, and these discounts are triggered when customers surpass certain predefined high-volume thresholds

U.S. service and other revenue was approximately $415,000, a 1% increase over the prior year

Gross profit for the second quarter 2019 was $12.4 million, an increase of $2.4 million from $10 million during the second quarter of 2018. Gross margin for the second quarter of 2019 was 74.8%, which was lower than the second quarter of 2018 gross margin of 75.5%. The decrease in gross margin was the result of a higher mix of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy revenue as well as the selling price decrease as noted above, partially offset by increased leverage on our service and operations cost as a result of higher sales compared to the prior year period

Sales and marketing expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were $11.5 million, an increase of $1.7 million over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the increased size of our sales force as well as spend related to marketing campaigns. General and administrative expenses were $4.3 million, an increase of approximately $1.2 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the increased costs associated with being a public company

Research and development expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were $3.2 million, an increase of approximately $0.9 million from the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to product development costs related to the continued development of our next-generation platform and higher personnel costs in preparation of new clinical trials

Net loss for the second quarter was $7.1 million compared to a net loss of $7.5 million in the second quarter of 2018

EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, for the second quarter of 2019 was a loss of $5.9 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $6.3 million in the second quarter of 2018

Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $89.6 million compared to $104.6 million at year-end 2018. Cash usage during the quarter was in line with our expectations. I would like to note that since we are now eligible to utilize Form S-3, the company will file a shelf registration statement for the offer and sale of up to $125 million of securities on a primary basis. In addition, this shelf registers 3.5 million shares that may be offered and sold by shareholders on a secondary basis pursuant to an investors' rights agreement. The filing of this shelf should not be interpreted as an indication that we will be pursuing a financing in the near term. Rather, this is just a matter of good corporate housekeeping

Turning to guidance. For the full year 2019, we are increasing our guidance of total worldwide revenue to between $63 million and $65 million, representing approximately 19% and 23% year-over-year growth, respectively, up from our prior guidance of $62.5 million to $64.5 million and inclusive of our expectations for international revenue for the year

For the third quarter of 2019, we expect total worldwide revenue of between $15.8 million and $16.4 million, representing 15% and 19% year-over-year growth, respectively

For the full year 2019, we continue to expect gross margins to be in the mid-70s range, in line with our previous guidance

For the full year 2019, we now expect operating expenses to be between $74 million and $77.5 million, up from the previous guidance of $71.5 million to $76.5 million. The small increase in operating expense guidance is primarily driven by our ongoing efforts to drive adoption, including the continued investment in our sales force expansion efforts, marketing, research and development related to the development of our next-generation NeuroStar platform and clinical spending as we pursue additional indications for PTSD and bipolar disorders

I'll now turn the call back over to Chris. Chris?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [5]

Thanks, Steve. We're very happy about our performance during the first half of 2019, as we have consistently demonstrated the execution of our growth strategy and achieved our financial objectives. Our ability to sustain growth is a direct reflection of our ability to successfully execute on improving long-term commercial strategy that we put in place in combination with the ongoing development of our industry-leading NeuroStar Advanced therapy system for the treatment of drug-resistant depression and potentially new indications. As we look to the second half of 2019 and into 2020, we believe our strong foundation in the U.S. as well as our recent expansion internationally sets the stage for continued growth

With that, I'd like now to open up the line for questions

Joining me on today's call are Neuronetics' Chief Executive Officer, Chris Thatcher; and its Chief Financial Officer, Steve Furlong

Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements covered under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements related to our business, strategy, financial and revenue guidance and other operational issues and metrics. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business

For a discussion of risks and uncertainties associated with Neuronetics' business, I encourage you to review the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's annual report on Form 10-K filed on March 5, 2019, and the Form 10-Q expected to be filed later today. The company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the course of this call, except as required by law

During the call, we'll also discuss certain financial information on a non-GAAP basis that includes EBITDA. Management believes that non-GAAP financial information taken in conjunction with U.S. GAAP financial measures provide useful information for both management and investors by excluding certain noncash and other expenses that are not indicative of our core operating results. Management uses non-GAAP measures to compare our performance relative to forecast and strategic plans to benchmark our performance externally against competitors and for certain compensation decisions

Reconciliations between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results are presented in tables accompanying our press release, which can be viewed on our website

With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Neuronetics' Chief Executive Officer, Chris Thatcher

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [3]

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. On today's call, I will provide an update on our performance during the third quarter, followed by an update on a few operational aspects of the business. I'll then hand the call over to Steve to walk through our financial performance and updated guidance for Q4 and the full year, after which we will provide our closing remarks before opening up the line to take your questions

Total revenue in the quarter was $16 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year primarily driven by an 18% growth in the U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy revenue and 11% growth in U.S. treatment session revenue. Results during the quarter were at the lower end of our expectations due to slightly lower productivity in our legacy customer base. This quarter was another very positive quarter for our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system and was the sixth consecutive quarter in a row that the active installed base increased by approximately 20% over the prior year quarter. This demonstrates our ability to consistently execute our strategy and the significant potential in what is still a relatively untapped market

On today's call, I'd like to focus my remarks on the following topics: The ongoing expansion of the BDM, CPC and CTC field sales forces; trends among HVT customers and in particular, TMS-only providers; marketing initiatives designed to raise awareness of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy; the early progress we're seeing in Japan and our plan to expand into new indications beyond major depressive disorder

Starting with an update on our BDM sales force. Our goal remains to bring our total BDM territories to 59 by year-end, which would be an increase of 15 versus the end of 2018. In the third quarter, we filled an additional 8 new territories and now have 13 of the 15 expansion territories filled year-to-date, bringing our current BDM territory count to 57. We have also been continuing to build a number of CPCs, or clinical practice consultants, and CTCs, or clinical training consultants, in line with the growth of our installed base. These teams are an important part of the value proposition that we offer customers to ensure that customers are supported in training and building a practice to maximize the utility of the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System

As of the end of the quarter, there are 33 CPCs and 15 CTCs in the field, and both of these cohorts are in line with our expectations for the size of these groups at the end of 2019. Going forward, the CPC will be referred to as a NeuroStar Practice Consultant or NPC, better recognizing the value they bring to our customer. This team's primary focus is working with our customers to help them drive treatment session volume

While we are trending well with new provider volume growth, we have found that we need to spend a bit more time with our legacy providers as they are not performing as well as expected. We are revisiting our call point cycles and anticipate this will take some time to optimize

I would now like to discuss some trends we observed at a few of our larger HVT accounts. As you may have seen through recent press releases, we're experiencing rapid growth with TMS-only providers who take patient referrals from psychiatrists in the community that don't currently offer TMS. They do their own local marketing and efficiently convert our DTC efforts

In September, we announced that our 100th system was installed with Greenbrook TMS, a NeuroStar Advanced Therapy provider with 82 treatment centers across the U.S. In October, we announced that we have agreed with Success TMS to be the preferred TMS technology at over 21 locations across 21 states. We're pleased that these large providers, which are multimillion dollar business entities, are choosing to partner with us over other companies in the TMS space. As these and other large providers expand, they often place multiunit orders, which would require a significant cash outlay. As a result, these customers are choosing to utilize rent-to-own agreements for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy Systems, which spreads the cash outlay over time and allows them to expand more quickly

This has led to a significant increase in other NeuroStar revenue during the quarter. These rent-to-own systems are accounted for as sales-type leases and have a lower ASP than a traditional capital sale

During the quarter, we also saw a significant uptick in other treatment session revenue, the primary driver of which is a rapid increase in the number of new systems being activated for HVT customers who utilize fixed price purchase agreements. We view this as a positive indicator of the demand for our therapies among these high volume centers, and we'll continue to opportunistically offer this pricing model to customers who feel that they can drive high volumes of patients and thus, multiple new system purchases over time through their practices

We're pleased with how our HVT strategy is playing out. Our ability to successfully partner with larger providers will allow us to continue to expand our installed base and drive predictable high-margin treatment session revenue

To help support practice utilization, we're continuing to utilize DTC marketing campaigns to expand awareness of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. We recently ran a national TV ad campaign in conjunction with National Depression Awareness month to leverage the spotlight on MDD to increase the awareness around NeuroStar Advanced Therapy and how we can help patients who are suffering

As a reminder, there are over 17 million adult Americans and over 300 million people worldwide that are depressed. However, less than half will see treatment, which is why increasing awareness of depression and the treatment options is critical

The October campaign was one of our most successful to date. Appointment requests increased 64% and physician located searches increased 33% over our May 2019 campaign. While we are thrilled with these results, we continue to look for ways to optimize the financial return on these campaigns

We're about to take those learnings and embark on expanded DTC pilot tests from mid-November through January next year. You may recall that in May, we ran a very successful pilot test where potential patients who responded to a commercial were directed to a call center. The clinical consultants at the call center determined if the patient would be a good candidate for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy, and if so booked the patient an appointment directly with a nearby NeuroStar psychiatrist. The purpose of this new pilot will be to determine the ROI on our DTC campaigns with a call center component before deciding how we best move forward

I'd like to update you on the expansion of our global footprint. As we announced earlier this year, NeuroStar Advanced Therapy received national reimbursement in Japan, which went into effect on June 1. The first patient was treated with NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in July. Subsequent to that, we have had good early commercial traction. Teijin placed another multisystem order in the quarter as they're beginning to get early adopters up and running

The sale of these systems was factored into our guidance for the year, although we were not sure whether the sales would occur in the third or fourth quarter. We currently don't have any additional system sales built into our outlook for the fourth quarter in Japan. We continue to view Japan as a high potential geography, but do not expect revenue -- but do expect revenues to be lumpy over the near-term as we work with our partner, Teijin, to increase awareness, get psychiatrist trained on the system, get systems installed and ultimately drive treatment session revenue

Lastly, I'd like to discuss the future expansion of indications for use for the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System. We're currently working with the FDA to determine the best regulatory path forward to expand our indications to include bipolar and PTSD. We expect to have some clarity on this pathway in early 2020, and we'll be able to share more at that time

The TMS market is still in its nascent stages, and the technology continues to gain popularity among psychiatrists, health care providers and patients. We're enthusiastic about the success we're having with their HVT strategy and our rapidly expanding active installed base. Overall, we believe that we remain well positioned to continue to drive top line growth in the business and build upon our market leadership position over the long term

I'd now like to hand the call over to Steve to discuss our financial performance

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CFO, VP of Finance &amp; Company Secretary   [4]

Thanks, Chris. Total revenue for the quarter was $16 million, a 16% increase over the prior year quarter. U.S. revenue was $15.3 million, an increase of 13% over the third quarter of 2018. Outside the U.S., revenue was approximately $700,000, an increase of approximately $490,000 versus the prior year quarter. U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenue for the third quarter of 2019 was $4.6 million, an increase of 18% over third quarter 2018 revenue of $3.9 million

As a reminder, this revenue line is comprised of NeuroStar Capital revenue, which is revenue from systems sold and other NeuroStar revenue, which has 3 primary components: Sales-type lease revenue; operating lease revenue; and revenue from upgrades to the 3.0 treatment coil

As Chris discussed, there were significantly higher number of sales-type leases in the quarter, which led to other NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenue of approximately $1.6 million during the quarter as compared to approximately $500,000 during the third quarter of 2018, representing 240% growth. NeuroStar Capital revenue in the quarter was driven by a 6% decrease in capital units sold and a 10% decline in average selling prices as compared to last year. On a sequential basis, average selling prices declined by 3%

During the quarter, we saw our active installed base increase to 1,032 units, a net increase of 174 units or 20% from the third quarter of 2018 and a net increase of 56 units sequentially. As a reminder, the active installed base includes capital units sold, sales-type leases and operating leases

U.S. treatment session revenue was $10.3 million for the third quarter of 2019, an increase of 11% over the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily due to an increase in other treatment session revenue, which represents our fixed price treatment session revenue. Per click treatment sessions purchased in the quarter grew by approximately 8%. This increase was partially offset by a 6% decline in treatment session ASPs due to predetermined volume pricing discounts within our existing customer base

During the quarter, other treatment session revenue was $1.4 million, up from $512,000 during the third quarter of 2018, representing over 170% growth. U.S. service and other revenue was approximately $426,000, a 9% increase over the prior year

Gross profit for the third quarter 2019 was $11.8 million, an increase of $1.1 million from $10.7 million during the third quarter of 2018. Gross margin for the third quarter of 2019 was 73.8%, which was lower than the third quarter of 2018 gross margin of 77.9%. The decrease in gross margin was the result of a higher mix of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy revenue and lower average selling prices as a result of a higher portion of new systems placed as sales-type leases

Sales and marketing expenses for the third quarter of 2019 were $10.4 million, an increase of approximately $700,000 over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the increased size of our sales force as well as spend related to marketing campaigns

General and administrative expenses were $4.3 million, an increase of approximately $1 million compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by increased compensation-related expenses. Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2019 were $3.5 million, an increase of approximately $1.4 million from the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to product development costs related to the continued development of our next-generation platform and higher personnel costs in preparation of the clinical trials

Net loss for the third quarter was $6.9 million compared to a net loss of $5 million in the third quarter of 2018. EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure for the third quarter of 2019, was a loss of $5.6 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $3.8 million in the third quarter of 2018

Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $82.4 million compared to $104.6 million at year-end 2018

Turning to guidance. For the full year 2019, we are reducing our guidance of total worldwide revenue to between $62 million and $63 million representing approximately 17% and 19% year-over-year growth, respectively, down from our prior guidance of $63 million and $65 million. The primary driver of the reduction in full year revenue guidance is lower-than-expected average selling prices and lower-than-expected volumes in certain existing customers

For the fourth quarter of 2019, we expect total worldwide revenue of between $16.7 million and $17.7 million, representing 7% and 13% year-over-year growth, respectively. For the full year 2019, we continue to expect gross margins to be in the mid-70s range, in line with our previous guidance. For the full year 2019, we now expect operating expenses to be between $73.5 million and $75.5 million, down slightly from our previous guidance of $74 million to $77.5 million

I'll now turn the call back over to Chris. Chris?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CEO, President &amp; Director   [5]

Thanks, Steve. We continue to be very excited by the opportunity for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy to help a significant number of patients worldwide who suffer from major depressive disorder. We're pleased with our success in partnering with some of the largest HVT providers and enthusiastic about this segment of the market and our leadership position. We continue to optimize our industry-leading commercial infrastructure to support our expanding customer base and our marketing efforts to raise awareness of TMS as a treatment for those suffering from depression

Longer term, we're enthusiastic about our ability to expand indications to bring relief to an even greater number of patients suffering from psychiatric disorders

With that, I'd like now to open up the line for questions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - Advisor   [3]

Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I'll provide an update on our performance during the fourth quarter, followed by an update on a few strategic aspects of the business. I'll then hand the call over to Steve to walk through our financial performance, after which I'll provide an update on the business going forward, including guidance for 2020. Then we'll open up the line to take your questions

Total revenue in the quarter was $17.4 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year primarily driven by 14% growth in U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy revenue and 13% growth in U.S. NeuroStar treatment session revenue. These results were in line with our expectations for the quarter, and we continue to be pleased with the pace at which we've been able to consistently grow our installed base, with the fourth quarter representing the seventh consecutive quarter in which the active installed base has grown approximately 20% over the prior year quarter. Through the continued execution of our commercial strategy, we've been able to consistently penetrate and take advantage of the large untapped market that exists in the U.S

Starting with an update on Business Development Managers or BDM sales force. As noted on previous calls, our goal for the year was to bring our total BDM territories to 59 by the end of 2019, and we met that goal. We also ended 2019 with 33 NeuroStar practice consultants and 15 clinical training consultants, in line with the plan we laid out at the beginning of 2019. The NPCs and CTCs are an important part of the value proposition that we offer to ensure that customers are supported in training and operationalizing NeuroStar in their practices. We continue to evaluate how to best resource our commercial team across BDMs, NPCs and CTCs to ensure the right balance between NeuroStar sales, driving system utilization and providing a high level of training and customer support. As I'll discuss later, we're going to make a modest shift in the focus of our commercial resources towards NPCs and CTCs in 2020

We had another quarter of strong system sales with our TMS-only providers. As a reminder, these are large businesses often having multiple sites across the country who either receive patient referrals from psychiatrists in the community that don't currently offer TMS or market directly to patients struggling with depression or both. We're thrilled at the pace at which we've been able to become the preferred partner to many of the country's largest TMS-only providers, and we will continue to focus on this attractive segment in the market as these providers are likely to drive consistently higher volumes of patients and make multiple new system purchases over time

On our last call, we mentioned a decline in system utilization amongst a subset of our legacy customer base. We did a thorough analysis of these accounts to determine the underlying cause of the slowdown and have worked with our sales and marketing teams to develop our strategy to reverse these trends. We found that there is room for improvement in utilization on a majority of these customers with the right combination of training and support. We did not expect to see a market improvement in the utilization of these systems in the fourth quarter as we're still in the process of working with these practices. However, we believe that we can deliver improved utilization in 2020

Shifting gears to our global expansion efforts. We continue to see solid early commercial traction in Japan following our positive reimbursement decision in June of 2019. We view Japan as a high potential geography and are very pleased with the work that our partner, Teijin, has done so far to develop the market. We expect revenues to be lumpy in the near-term as we work with Teijin to increase awareness, system installations and psychiatrists training with a goal of driving both capital and treatment session revenues

Lastly, I'd like to discuss the future expansion of indications for use for the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system. We're very excited to announce that the company's recently received Breakthrough Device Designation in the U.S. from the FDA for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy treatment for bipolar disorder. Breakthrough Designation provides several potential advantages, including a proactive and faster dialogue with the FDA, the potential for innovative clinical trial design via the program's clinical protocol agreement process and an expedited review process of the company's submissions to the FDA. It also validates the need for an effective nonpharmaceutical treatment option for this disorder. We're working with the FDA to determine the specific clinical study design and expect to have some clarity on this later in the year, at which time, we'll share more details

Overall, we believe that we remain well positioned to continue to drive top line growth in the business and build upon our market leadership position over the long term. Despite some recent lumpiness and utilization among the small percentage of our customers, throughout the year we have continuously demonstrated our ability to drive the adoption and utilization of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy

I'd now like to hand the call over to Steve to discuss our financial performance

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - CFO   [4]

Thanks, Chris. Before I provide a review of our fourth quarter financial performance, I would like to bring your attention to a change in the way we are going to report our U.S. revenues. As our business has evolved, as a result of the increased usage of sales-type leases as well as fixed price treatment session contracts, the composition of our U.S. revenue has shifted. In an effort to provide investors with the most useful information on our business, we have changed how we present our U.S. revenue. Under the new reporting structure, U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue will be reported as 3 separate items: NeuroStar capital revenue, the significant majority of system revenue, which consists of revenue from capital sales and revenue from sales-type leases; operating lease revenue, which consists of revenue recognized from units previously rented; and other revenue, primarily revenue generated from the sale of treatment coil upgrades

In addition to providing a breakout of these 3 items within U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue, we will be providing a number of new systems installed in the U.S. during the quarter. This number represents the total number of units sold in the U.S. as either a capital sale or a sales-type lease

Total U.S. treatment session revenue is comprised of all U.S. treatment session revenues from both our per click business as well as our fixed-price contracts. Going forward, we will provide an average revenue per active system metric defined as total U.S. treatment session revenue divided by the U.S. active installed base at the end of the prior quarter. We will be providing a supplemental disclosure document on the IR portion of our website, which includes a quarterly historical breakout of the new U.S. revenue reporting structure for 2018 and 2019

Turning to the quarterly results. Total revenue for the quarter was $17.4 million, an 11% increase over the prior year quarter. U.S. revenue was $17 million, an increase of 13% over the fourth quarter of 2018. International revenue was approximately $325,000, a decrease of approximately $220,000 versus the prior year quarter. The year-over-year decrease was a function of the initial stocking order of systems placed by Teijin during the fourth quarter of 2018 that did not recur this year. U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $5.4 million, an increase of 14% over fourth quarter 2018 revenue of $4.8 million

In the fourth quarter of 2019, NeuroStar capital revenue was $5 million, an increase of 14% over the fourth quarter of 2018. In the quarter, a total of 78 units were sold compared to 65 units in the fourth quarter of 2018. As anticipated, blended average selling prices declined 11% as compared to the prior year due to a higher mix of sales-type leases versus capital sales and lower prices on capital sales. We expect that average selling prices will fluctuate based on the mix of capital sales and sales-type leases as well as underlying pricing trends

During the quarter, we saw our active installed base increase by 21% to 1,085 units, a net increase of 178 units from the fourth quarter of 2018 and a net increase of 53 units sequentially. As a reminder, the active installed base includes capital units sold, sales-type leases and operating lease units. In the fourth quarter of 2019, U.S. operating lease revenue was $176,000, a decrease of 24% as compared to the prior year quarter. Due to the accounting change that went into effect in 2019, we don't currently expect to install any new systems under operating lease agreements. And thus, this revenue number will eventually go to 0. In the fourth quarter of 2019, other U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue was $278,000, an increase of 50% over the prior year quarter as we saw an increase in the number of treatment coil upgrades compared to the prior year quarter

Turning to U.S. treatment session revenues. U.S. treatment session revenue was $11.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of 13% over the prior year quarter. The increase in treatment session revenue was driven by our larger customer base, purchasing more treatment sessions and a larger number of systems installed under fixed-price contracts

During the quarter, average revenue per active system was approximately $10,900, a decrease of 5% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to the substantial number of new systems sold in the last 18 months that have not yet ramped up to steady state utilization and price declines for per click treatment session

U.S. service and other revenue was approximately $376,000, a 12% decline over the prior year. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $13.1 million, an increase of $1.2 million from $11.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2018. We continue to generate very strong gross margins in the fourth quarter of 2019 at 75.7%, down just a bit from the fourth quarter of 2018 gross margin of 76.3%. This small decrease in gross margin resulted from a higher mix of sales-type leases and lower average selling prices on capital system sales

Sales and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $11.5 million, an increase of approximately $825,000 over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the increased size of our sales force. General and administrative expenses were $4.3 million, a decrease of approximately $385,000 compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by the year-over-year timing of public company costs. Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $4.2 million, an increase of approximately $2 million from the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to product development costs related to the continued development of our next-generation platform and higher personnel costs in preparation for clinical trials. Net loss for the fourth quarter was $7.6 million compared to a net loss of $6.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, for the fourth quarter of 2019 was a loss of $6.3 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018

Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $75.7 million compared to $104.6 million at the end of 2018. We are pleased to announce we closed on a $50 million term loan with Solar Capital, which allows us to repay the $30 million currently outstanding on our prior debt facility within the interest-only period and provides for additional capital to bolster our balance sheet at favorable terms. The debt is available in 2 tranches, which would be funded as follows: tranche 1, $35 million, funded yesterday; tranche 2, $15 million, will be available to be funded on or before December 15, 2021, at our request and within 30 days of our achieving a net product revenue milestone measured on a trailing 12-month basis, measured on or before November 30, 2021. The interest-only period on the initial tranche is 24 months but can be extended by an additional 12 months on our achieving a net product revenue milestone measured on a trailing 12-month basis, measured again on or before November 30, 2021

I'll now turn the call back over to Chris. Chris?

Christopher A. Thatcher,  Neuronetics, Inc. - Advisor   [5]

Thanks, Steve. As we move into 2020 and beyond, we'll be putting an increased focus on accelerating our pathway to profitability. As a result, we'll be taking some actions with our spending and strategic initiatives this year, focusing on a path to EBITDA positive in late 2022 to early 2023. We also would note that we believe that cash on hand combined with credit available to us is sufficient to get us to EBITDA positive

Starting with the sales force. Over the last couple of years, we've gone through a period of rapid expansion, and we currently believe that BDM territories in the mid-50s is the most appropriate and optimal number of territories that cover the U.S. at this time. Despite the slight decline in the total number of territories versus where we ended 2019, we believe that we can continue to drive growth in new system installations as a number of BDM full-time equivalents or FTEs will actually be higher in 2020 than 2019 due to the cadence of hiring throughout the year. We've also expanded our HVT-targeted universe to the top 5,700 solo and group practices in the U.S. that treat 60% of the MDD patients in these types of practices. This gives the BDMs more accounts to prospect and optimizes the BDMs' productivity at this juncture. In order to keep up with our growing installed base, we will add NPCs and CTCs to drive new system ramp up and facilitate ongoing utilization. Thus, in 2020, we expect to hire 7 NPCs as well as a regional manager, along with 2 additional CTCs

Another area of the business we're adjusting is our international expansion efforts. In the past, we have considered entering a number of incremental geographic regions in Western Europe and Asia. However, given the large greenfield opportunities in both the U.S. and Japan that still exists, we will remain focused on these regions exclusively for the time being

I would now like to discuss our product and clinical development efforts. As noted earlier, we just received Breakthrough Device Designation for bipolar disorder from the FDA, so we decided to concentrate our near-term efforts on this indication. Bipolar disorder by definition is someone that has undergone episode of depression followed by an episode of mania. We're going to focus on the greatest unmet need, which is the episode of depression

We remain interested in pursuing a PTSD indication as well, but think it's prudent from a cash management and profitability perspective to prioritize our clinical development activities first on the bipolar disorder. We are also continuing development of our next-generation NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system with an eye on improved usability, precision and reproducibility

Turning to guidance for the full year 2020. We're setting guidance of total worldwide revenue to between $69 million and $71 million, representing approximately 10% to 13% year-over-year growth, respectively. For the first quarter of 2020, we expect worldwide revenue of between $13.5 million and $14 million, representing 6% and 10% year-over-year growth, respectively. For the full year 2020, we expect to generate strong gross margins to remain in the mid-70% range, and we expect operating expenses to between $76 million and $78 million

We're very excited about the opportunity for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy to help a significant number of patients who suffer from major depressive disorder. We intend to maintain our market share leadership position in the category by offering the most advanced and effective technology and the best customer support to the largest and most sophisticated commercial team in the industry. We plan to leverage this team to continue to expand our installed base at an impressive rate, drive system utilization and provide best-in-class customer support and training. Our commercial strategy remains consistent as we continue to focus on both the TMS-only and HVT providers, and we will continue to invest prudently in marketing programs to drive awareness of our therapy with patients and increased systems use at customers' practices. We look forward to updating you on our progress during the year

With that, I'd like to open up the line for questions

Operator   [1]

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the first quarter 2020 financial and operating results conference call. (Operator Instructions)
 I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Mark Klausner. Thank you. And please go ahead, sir

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Mark R. Klausner,  Westwicke Partners, LLC - Managing Partner   [2]

Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Neuronetics' First Quarter 2020 Conference Call. A replay of this call will be available on our website for 30 days. Joining me on today's call are Neuronetics' Chief Financial Officer Steve Furlong; and Andy Macan, Senior Vice President and General Counsel. Steve and Andy are also members of the Company's Office of the President

Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that certain information discussed by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements covered under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements related to our business strategy, financial and revenue guidance, the impact of COVID-19, and other operational issues and metrics. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties associated with Neuronetics' business, I encourage you to review the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including the company's annual report on Form 10-K filed on March 3, 2020 and quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which will be filed later today. The company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the course of this call except as required by law

During the call, we'll also discuss certain information on a non-GAAP basis, including EBITDA. Management believes that non-GAAP financial information taken in conjunction with U.S. GAAP financial measures provides useful information for both management and investors by excluding certain noncash and other expenses that are not indicative of trends in our operating results. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures to compare our performance relative to forecast and strategic plans to benchmark our performance externally against competitors and for certain compensation decisions. Reconciliations between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results are presented in tables accompanying our press release, which can be viewed on our website

With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Neuronetics' Chief Financial Officer, Steve Furlong

 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [3]

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, I'll provide an update on recent events that have occurred within the company along with an overview of how the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic turmoil are impacting our business. I'll then provide an overview of our first quarter financial results, provide our thoughts on the remainder of the year and then open the call up for your questions

Beginning with the management transition, in early March, the company announced the transition and senior management. The Board of Directors established an interim Office of the President, made up of myself and Andy Macan, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, to lead the business while the company recruits a new CEO

Additionally, Brian Farley, the company's Chairman of the Board was appointed as the Board's liaison to the Office of the President. The Board of Directors has appointed an Executive Search Committee and has engaged a recruiting firm who is performing a formal search for a permanent CEO. In the meantime, we continue to drive the company's tactical and strategic initiatives with the goal of maintaining and expanding our market leading position

Shifting gears, I would like to provide an update on our response to the impact of COVID-19 as well as an update on our business more generally

As previously announced, we have experienced a material impact on our business from COVID-19. As a result, we have taken numerous proactive steps aimed at keeping our employees and customers safe, continuing to support our customers and their patients during the crisis and managing our capital resources with a view towards both near- and long-term business continuity

Depression is a debilitating condition that millions of patients suffer from worldwide and for those undergoing or in need of TMS treatment for depression, we believe that TMS treatment is a medical necessity. The company is not aware of any COVID-19-related government order that prohibits the initiation or continuation of TMS therapy for the treatment of depression. We estimate today that approximately 1/3 of our customers have temporarily suspended treating patients while many others have heavily curtailed TMS patient treatments. We believe adoption of safe and appropriate pandemic operating procedures by our customers is possible, and many customers have already established these operating protocols. To facilitate safe ongoing use of the company's products, the company has provided customers with clear sanitizing and disinfecting procedures for the NeuroStar TMS Therapy system

Clinical associations such as the Clinical TMS Society are similarly providing guidance to practitioners on delivery of this important therapy in a manner that is protective of both patients and practitioners. At this time, it is not clear when practices that have suspended or curtailed in-person patient treatments will begin to restart patient treatments utilizing the pandemic TMS and patient treatment protocols. In the short term, we expect that our capital equipment sales and treatment session revenues will be materially impacted by this pandemic as customers are deferring capital purchase decisions, and new patient treatment starts and system utilization have declined compared to our pre-COVID-19 projections

In the first quarter, total revenue was $11.5 million, down 10% versus the prior-year quarter. During the first 2 months of the year we were on track to hit our previously issued revenue guidance for the quarter. Beginning in mid-March, as the spread of COVID-19 and related stay-at-home orders accelerated in the U.S., we started to see a significant decline in both new system sales and treatment session volumes. Despite our belief that TMS treatment is a medical necessity for the treatment of depression, system sales slowed and various levels of shelter-in-place initiatives to turn patients from seeking treatment and cause some customers to temporarily reduce or cease providing TMS Therapy

As a result of both the recent management transition and the anticipated impact of COVID-19, the company implemented a number of steps to adjust the size of the business with a focus on both near- and long-term business continuity. Even before COVID-19, we were evaluating the company's commercial model with the goal of rightsizing our organization. Prior to the restructuring implemented on April 8th, the company had 213 employees including a 152 in the sales and marketing organization. After the restructuring, which involved layoffs, furloughs and spending decreases, the company has a 117 employees, of which 74 are in the sales and marketing organization. It was a difficult decision to reduce staffing but in doing so, we believe the company is in a far better position to weather a prolonged impact of the pandemic on our business and come out successfully

We also reduced our marketing spend and delayed certain projects to reduce expenses and conserve cash. The full financial effect of these changes will emerge in the third quarter of 2020. We now project operating expenses in the second half of 2020 to range from $25 million to $27 million. This represents a projected reduction of our operating expenses in the second half of 2020 of approximately one-third compared to the first half of the year

It is our belief that the company can maintain industry leading customer service with fewer people and more efficient processes. Given the restructuring and the ongoing economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, our priorities have shifted accordingly. We had previously calibrated our commercial organization using a traditional sales representative productivity model, where the majority of the growth in the business was driven primarily by adding BDM to drive system placements and adding MPCs and CTCs to improve system utilization

With the current revenue pressures along with the shift in our customer base to a higher mix of 'TMS-only providers', who have unique buying preferences and system utilization, we now believe that we can support the future growth of the business with this realigned commercial organization

As it relates to our geographic expansion efforts, we have previously indicated that we will continue to focus exclusively on the opportunity that exists in Japan. That strategy remains unchanged, as we still view Japan as a medium-term growth driver for the business. While our expectations for the revenue contribution from Japan for this year were not initially significant, we have started to see a negative impact from COVID-19, similar to what we are experiencing in the U.S. We will continue to monitor the situation alongside our distribution partner Teijin with our goal of anticipating and appropriately reacting to changing conditions in Japan

Lastly, as to our indication expansion efforts, we are continuing dialog with the FDA regarding appropriate study designs for demonstrating efficacy in treating bipolar disorder and potentially other indications

Before shifting to a financial review, I would like to briefly comment on the limited duration stockholder rights plan that we recently announced. The Board believes that the Company's current trading level does not reflect Neuronetics' inherent value or the potential of our products and strategy execution. Given the share price dislocations created by an extremely turbulent market, the Board of Directors adopted the rights plan to protect all shareholders' best interests. The rights plan is designed to guard against opportunistic tactics to exert control over the company during this period of economic uncertainty and market volatility, protect long-term shareholder value, and ensure that all of our shareholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of the company. For further details regarding the rights plan, please review the current report on Form 8-K filed on April 8, 2020

Now shifting gears to a financial review, total revenue for the first quarter of 2020 was $11.5 million, a 10% decrease compared to first quarter 2019 revenue of $12.7 million. From the beginning of the year until mid-March, we were on track to meet our previously announced guidance of $13.5 million to $14 million. Starting in mid-March, the COVID-19 pandemic, government-mandated social distancing and the resulting economic turmoil caused a significant drop-off in performance across our business. Our system sales were heavily impacted in late March as many customers deferred or delayed purchasing decisions due to the impact of COVID-19. Nevertheless, our sales team was able to successfully sell 38 NeuroStar systems in Q1, 2020, compared to 43 systems in Q1, 2019

Similarly treatment session volumes, both from ongoing treatment and new patient starts, declined substantially beginning in mid-March as shelter-in-place orders and other similar restrictions were put in place throughout the United States. To provide some context on the magnitude of the decline, we are going to share some operating metrics that we typically do not disclose and do not anticipate providing on an ongoing basis

In March, we saw 21% year-over-year decline in per-click treatment session volume even though the COVID-19 disruptions did not substantially impact our business until the second half of March. New patient starts across all of our customers fell by an average of over 55% during the final 2 weeks of March as compared to the average weekly run rate during January and February

The trends that we experienced in late March continued into April. Total revenue for the month was down approximately 45% versus April of last year. Total U.S. capital revenue was most significantly impacted from a year-over-year perspective, down approximately 80% as customers continued to defer or delay purchasing decisions. Within the treatment session portion of the business, we saw continued year-over-year slowdown in April with total treatment session revenue down approximately 33%. The decline was primarily driven by a significant increase in per-click treatment session volumes

The U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue for the first quarter of 2020 was $2.6 million, a decrease of 23% versus first quarter 2019 revenue of $3.3 million. The decrease was primarily driven by fewer NeuroStar system sales as well as lower other revenues related to HP coil revenue in the first quarter of 2020. We expect that average selling prices will fluctuate based on the mix of capital sales and sales-type leases as well as underlying pricing trends

In the first quarter, NeuroStar capital revenue was $2.4 million, a decrease of 18% compared to first quarter 2019 revenue of $2.9 million. During the quarter, we saw our active installed base increase by 20% to 1,119 units, a net increase of 188 units from the first quarter of 2019 and a net increase of 34 units sequentially. As a reminder, the active installed base includes capital units sold, sales-type leases and operating lease units

In the first quarter, US operating lease revenue was $155,000, a decrease of 15% compared to the prior-year quarter. Due to the accounting change that went into effect in 2019, we don't currently expect to install any new systems under operating lease agreements and thus this revenue number will eventually go to 0 as the terms of these operating leases expire

In the first quarter of 2020 other U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue was $29,000, a decrease of approximately 80% over the prior-year quarter as we saw a significant decline in the number of treatment coil upgrades purchased during the quarter

Turning to U.S. treatment session revenue, U.S. treatment session revenue was $8.2 million for the first quarter of 2020, a decrease of 7% over the prior year quarter. The decrease in treatment session revenue was driven by a decline in average revenue per active system, largely caused by a material reduction and per click treatment session volume during March, caused by COVID-19. During the quarter, average revenue per active system was approximately $7,600, a decrease of 22% from the prior year quarter primarily driven by a 16% year-over-year decrease in U.S. treatment session revenues during March, being spread over a much larger active installed base during the first quarter of 2020

Gross margin for the first quarter of 2020 was 75.5% compared to first quarter 2019 gross margin of 77.9%. The decrease was the result of lower blended NeuroStar capital system ASPs as well as lower per-click treatment session volumes during the quarter. Operating expenses during the first quarter of 2020 were $19.1 million, an increase of $2.1 million compared to $17 million in the first quarter of 2019. The increase was primarily driven by sales force, higher product and clinical development expenses, as well as management transition costs

Net loss for the quarter -- for the first quarter of 2020 was $12.6 million or negative $0.68 per share as compared to first quarter 2019 loss of $7.5 million or negative $0.42 per share. EBITDA for the first quarter of 2020 was negative $10.5 million as compared to the first quarter of 2019 EBITDA of negative $6.4 million

Moving to the balance sheet, as noted earlier we have put in a significant amount of effort aimed at ensuring that we have adequate capital resources and liquidity to support the business over both the near and long term. As of March 31, cash and cash equivalents were $63.6 million. On April 27, we disclosed that we had applied for and received a $6.4 million loan from the Paycheck Protection Program. The intent of the PPP is to help small businesses, like Neuronetics, and their employees weather the COVID-19 pandemic and the business-closure mandates enacted through the US. Neuronetics intended to use the PPP loan proceeds for exactly these purposes

Due to questions concerning the eligibility of public companies similarly situated to the Company, the Company will repay its PPP loan on or before May 7, 2020. Frankly, it's a shame. The PPP could have provided an important bridge to companies like ours that have been severely [impact] by COVID-19 and lacked access to other forms of liquidity. The PPP loan would have benefited our employees and partially mitigated the significant disruption that COVID-19 has had on our business

Beyond conserving cash, we are significantly reducing operating expenses. The Company now estimates operating expenses for the full year 2020 to be in the range of $58 million to $60 million, compared to the previously issued guidance of $76 million to $78 million. Based on the restructuring of the business and the realignment of our strategy, we expect operating expenses to be in the range of $12 million to $14 million per quarter. [At] these levels, we now believe that we are likely to achieve operating-income breakeven at revenue of $18 million to $20 million per quarter

Looking into the balance of 2020, given the ongoing disruption caused by COVID-19, we withdrew our full-year 2020 revenue guidance in early April. With substantially all of our revenues generated in the US, our revenue performance during the remainder of the year will be driven in large part by the cadence of reductions and eventual elimination of COVID-19-related stay-at-home orders and social-distancing restrictions throughout the Country

Q2 capital-equipment placements will be highly correlated with new and existing customers' willingness to expand their TMS service capabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic and their abilities to secure financing through third-party lenders. We will continue to drive revenue from treatment sessions where practices are actively treating patients, but we acknowledge that the volume of treatment sessions being purchased is materially lower than we would typically see. Based on these expectations and our April results, we expect our second-quarter revenue to be down materially, both sequentially and year over year

Once restrictions have been eased, we believe there is the potential for a return in demand for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy in the back half of the year. There will not only be a backlog of patients who have not been able to access treatment during the quarantine who will seek it, but we believe it is entirely possible to see a spike in new patient starts in response to the intense strain put upon many Americans during this period. Any such increased demand for mental health services should help to keep psychiatric practices and providers in good economic health. Like these customers, we are in a good position to help a potentially growing number of MDD patients as they become suitable for TMS, making our therapy more important than ever

With that, I would like to open up the line for questions

 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [3]

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call is Neuronetics' newly appointed President and Chief Executive Officer, Keith Sullivan. After Keith provides an introduction, I will shift to a high-level overview of our second quarter performance and recent trends in the business, after which I will review our second quarter results and then provide our thoughts on the balance of the year. I will then turn the call back over to Keith for his thoughts on near-term initiatives before opening the line for questions

With that, I would like to hand the call over to Keith. Keith?

Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [4]

Thanks, Steve, and thanks, everyone, for joining us for our call today. I want to begin by saying how excited I am to be joining Neuronetics. I'm incredibly enthusiastic about the long-term opportunity that exists for the company to improve the quality of life for patients suffering from psychiatric disorders

Let me give you a brief overview of my background. I've been in the medical device space for almost 3 decades. Before joining Neuronetics, I spent over 5 years at ZELTIQ in leadership roles within the commercial organization, ending my tenure as President and Chief Commercial Officer at the time that Allergan acquired the company in 2017. Prior to ZELTIQ, I have held leadership roles at a variety of pharmaceutical and medical device companies, including Medicis Pharmaceuticals, Reliant Technologies, Medtronic and Coherent Medical

Before the Neuronetics opportunity arose, I had independently spent a fair amount of time examining the TMS industry as a whole as well as Neuronetics specifically. In fact, I was a consultant to the company on 2 occasions prior to and immediately after the commercial launch of NeuroStar. While a professor at the Mason School of Business at William &amp; Mary, I wrote and taught a case study on the TMS-only provider business with a focus on Greenbrook TMS, Neuronetics' largest customer

In addition, I have known Bruce Shook for years. As you're aware, Bruce recently rejoined Neuronetics as a Board member after having cofounded and led the company for a number of years as CEO

I'd like to share with you what made me excited about the opportunity and why I think the company has such a bright future. First, we are the unquestioned market leader in a rapidly growing in-demand therapeutic sector. We have more systems installed and have treated and helped more patients than all other TMS providers combined. Second, we have a tremendous technology supported by the highest quality clinical data in the industry. Because of this, our systems are proven, reliable and clinically robust. Third, we have a well-established commercial infrastructure that has been reorganized over the last few months and now has the potential to drive meaningful growth. Our focus is to drive greater awareness of the benefits of NeuroStar amongst patients as well as provide meaningful support to our psychiatry providers. And lastly, we have a great team here at Neuronetics, and I'm impressed with their knowledge, motivation and dedication to our mission. Having said that, I believe that there are areas of the business that can be optimized to best take advantage of the opportunity that exists

Only a few weeks on the job, I am currently in the process of digging into every aspect of the business as well as talking to customers and patients to make sure that I fully understand the current needs of the market. Using those insights, we will put them into the -- place the optimal strategy to drive the highest quality therapy to the greatest number of people. While it is too early to provide a detailed outline of our long-term strategy, what I know at this point is that with the tremendous foundation that exists today, we can take this business to the next level and drive long-term success, allowing us to help more patients suffering from psychiatric disorders

With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Steve to provide an update for the second quarter. Steve?

Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [5]

Thanks, Keith

Total revenue for the second quarter was $9.7 million, down 41% over the prior year, primarily as a result of COVID-19, which persisted throughout the quarter, causing an impact to both our capital equipment sales and the utilization of systems in the field. Given the challenges presented by COVID, we are pleased with the performance of the business during the period

On the capital equipment side, after an April in which new system sales were effectively shut down, we saw a strong sequential uptick in May and June. Another key metric of performance is per-click treatment session volumes. While these volumes continue to slow down in May, we have seen a reversal of that trend in June, and we now believe that May will represent the low point for treatment session volumes for the year

At the end of the quarter, we estimate that approximately 80% of our customers were back up and running, up from 70% that we noted on May's call. Based on the 80% of customers who are on our cloud-based TrakStar management tool, we have seen an approximate 70% increase in average daily treatment session volume from the low point in early May through the end of June. We have seen similar trends and new patient starts as defined by patients doing a motor threshold test. After hitting a trough in early May, new patient starts at the end of June are approaching the volumes we were seeing in January and February

Capital purchases have begun to come back but at a slower rate than the rebound in system utilization. For much of the second quarter, our BDMs were frozen out of the market due to travel and social distancing restrictions. Where these restrictions have started to ease, BDMs have begun to get back out into the field to prospect accounts. We do anticipate that capital sales will continue to rebound, albeit at a slower rate

I would like to provide an update on some key topics related to the business. As a result of the current environment, we are seeing an increased focus on mental health throughout the United States, which recent prescription data has reinforced. In an April Express Scripts report, data showed that the use of prescription drugs to treat mental health conditions increased by more than 20% between mid-February and mid-March, with prescriptions for antidepressants increasing by 18%. Importantly, when looking at prescriptions filled during the week of March 15, 78% were new prescriptions. This indicates a significant increase in patients suffering from depression who are seeking care. While this is a point in time estimate during a notably stressful period in American history, we continue to believe that there will be a significant uptick in depression patients, many of whom will ultimately fail pharmaceutical treatment and will be seeking an alternative therapy

As we announced in April, we restructured our commercial organization as part of our corporate reorganization. This included a substantial reduction in headcount within our sales team. At the end of the quarter, that team consists of approximately 45 employees spread between the 3 key roles: business development managers or BDMs, who are focused on capital sales; NeuroStar practice consultants or NPCs, who are focused on operationalizing and driving the utilization of systems within practices; and clinical training consultants or CTCs, who are focused on training psychiatrists and staff on proper usage of systems once installed. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately 16 BDMs, 17 NPCs and 7 CTCs. While we added back a few NPCs and CTCs in July to service the improving system utilization, we may selectively increase the size of the team in the future. We believe the size and structure of the sales force will allow us to generate top line growth by focusing on driving increased system utilization and by more effectively deploying our BDMs

On our last call, we noted that with psychiatrist offices closed and patients being held under social distancing restrictions, we reduced spending on certain marketing initiatives to conserve cash. We did, however, continue to actively invest in areas that we think will benefit the company, our customers and patients over the long run. Initiatives like the call center pilot, virtual training and digital marketing. Our call center pilot connects patients who visit our website to a live call center operator who can then schedule an appointment directly with the psychiatrists in their area. The early indications from this pilot are exceeding our expectations, and we are in the process of planning for a broader launch later in 2020

In response to the COVID pandemic and a need to continue to support NeuroStar practices staying open to treat TMS patients, we offered a series of webinars in the second quarter. Over 900 individuals registered for these webinars on topics ranging from peace of mind for patients that provided videos on how to prepare the office and treat patients with TMS during COVID to TMS coverage and reimbursement update that outlines several recent positive changes in coverage

On the digital marketing front, we continue to leverage this cost-effective method to educate patients and psychiatrists on the benefits of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy

We have also seen notable progress in our reimbursement landscape recently. Our FDA current indication is adult patients who have failed to achieve satisfactory improvement from one prior antidepressant medication. However, many payers have taken a more conservative approach in terms of the number of failed drugs before they will reimburse for NeuroStar Therapy. As a company, we have been working with payers to change that and make NeuroStar Advanced Therapy more readily available for patients seeking to manage their depression

During the quarter, we had several notable wins, including Cigna, which represents 16 million covered lives. We were able to reduce pharmacotherapy criteria from 4 failed drugs to 2 failed drugs or intolerance to 1 medical trial. Aetna, which represents 22 million covered lives, we were able to extend coverage to include patients between 18 and 21 years old where it previously had been exclusively for 21 years old and over, added a provision for retreatment approval based on 50% improvement and reduced pharmacotherapy criteria from 4 failed drugs to 2 failed drugs. And finally, HCSC/Blue Cross/Blue Shield, which represents 15 million covered lives, we were able to reduce pharmacotherapy criteria from 4 failed drugs to 2 failed drugs. We view this as a meaningful progress towards making it easier for patients to get access to NeuroStar Advanced Therapy and should lead to an increase in new patient start volumes over the longer term. We will continue to work to make this shift more broadly adopted among all payers

Shifting gears to our financial performance. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was $9.7 million, a 41% decrease compared to the second quarter 2019 revenue of $16.6 million. This was primarily a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, related governmental responses and resulting economic turmoil

U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was $2.3 million, a decrease of 49% versus second quarter 2019 revenue of $4.6 million. The decrease was primarily driven by a lower number of NeuroStar systems sold in the quarter, lower blended NeuroStar capital system ASPs due to a higher mix of sales type leases during the quarter as well as lower other revenue related to fewer HP Coil upgrades sold. In the quarter, the company sold 35 systems, down from 61 systems in the second quarter of 2019 as a result of the impact of COVID-19

During the quarter, we saw our installed base increased by 13% to 1,122 systems, a net increase of 146 systems from the second quarter of 2019 and a net increase of 3 systems since March 31, 2020

Turning to U.S. treatment session revenue. U.S. treatment session revenue was $6.5 million for the second quarter of 2020, a decrease of 40% over the prior year. Average revenue per system was $5,850 during the second quarter of 2020 compared to $11,651 in the prior year quarter. Both of these declines were driven by COVID-19-related practice shutdowns

Gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 was 76.2% compared to second quarter 2019 gross margin of 74.8%. The increase was primarily a result of a change in the product mix of revenues versus the prior year

Operating expenses during the second quarter of 2020 were $14.3 million, a decrease of $4.7 million compared to $19 million in the second quarter of 2019. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to reduced sales and marketing expenses, including trade shows and advertising, travel expense and personnel costs. On a sequential basis, operating expenses decreased $4.7 million from $19 million during the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the implementation of our cost saving initiatives

Net loss for the second quarter of 2020 was $7.8 million or $0.41 per share as compared to second quarter 2019 net loss of $7.1 million or $0.39 per share

EBITDA for the second quarter of 2020 was negative $6.2 million as compared to the second quarter of 2019 EBITDA of negative $5.9 million

Moving to the balance sheet. As noted earlier, we have put in a significant amount of effort aimed at ensuring that we have adequate capital resources and liquidity to support the business over both the near and long term

As of June 30, cash and cash equivalents were $54 million. We remain focused on conserving capital, and earlier this year, instituted a number of cost reduction initiatives. We expect to realize the full impact of these cost reductions in the third and fourth quarters. The company continues to project total operating expenses for the full year 2020 to be in the range of $58 million to $60 million. Going forward, we continue to expect quarterly operating expenses to be in the range of $12 million to $14 million. And at those levels, we believe that we are likely to achieve operating income breakeven that revenues between $18 million and $20 million per quarter

Moving on to our outlook for the balance of the year. We believe that April and May will be the worst-performing months of the year, causing the second quarter to be the worst-performing quarter of the year. Looking forward, we expect to see modest sequential recovery in both the third and fourth quarters

I would now like to hand the call back over to Keith. Keith?

Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [6]

Thanks, Steve

Before opening the lines for questioning, I'd like to outline the areas of the business that we will be focused on in the near term. First is to drive awareness of TMS as a very safe, effective therapy for depression. We plan to conduct market research to identify the proper target audience, the messaging that resonates with them and the most efficient way to communicate with them. We currently have a significant number of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy systems in the field, and we will be focused on working with our customers to make all of these systems successful

The second area of focus is our commercial organization. The leadership team has adjusted the field sales team to drive treatment session volume and revenue per system. Once the market data is collected, we can create the proper tools to arm our NPCs with what they need to help our accounts with educating depression sufferers on the benefits of TMS to help convert them to patients. This is a process that will take some time to deploy, but we are confident that we can be a valuable partner with our accounts to make them successful and help their patients

In my prior experience in the aesthetics space, it was not too long ago we would walk into a practice where the physicians had little to no experience generating patient demand and were not actively driving new patient volume. We were able to drastically change that through coaching and demand generation. We believe that the same can be done with the psychiatric community. With the power of social and digital marketing as a tool for both driving awareness and generating demand, we can partner with these practices to build a thriving business, treating patients and supporting their growth. When we achieve this growth, it will be a catalyst to drive additional system sales

Lastly, we are accelerating our indication expansion efforts in an effective and efficient manner. We have long believed that the NeuroStar platform can and should have a much broader applicability within the treatment of psychiatric disorders. As such, we will be evaluating our go-forward strategy to make sure that we can progress through the regulatory process more efficiently and bring new indications to the market sooner

I'm very excited about what the future holds for Neuronetics. Throughout the pandemic, we have put into place a highly proactive strategic set of initiatives that put us in a position of strength that will set us up for success as the world continues to reopen. Building on that foundation, we believe that by executing our marketing plan, coupled with our proven technological advantages, robust clinical evidence and future additional indications, we will continue to expand our leadership position in the field of TMS and have a greater number of patients achieve relief from debilitating mental illness over the near, medium and long-term

With that, I would like to open the line for questions

 Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [3]

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I will provide an overview of the third quarter performance and then discuss the progress we made on our near-term focus areas. Steve will then give our third quarter results, and I will conclude with our thoughts on the balance of 2020 before turning to questions and answers

Starting with the review of the third quarter. Total revenue was $12.4 million, up 28% sequentially over the second quarter of 2020, driven by growth in both system sales and treatment session revenue. Although there was year-over-year decline in revenue due to the ongoing impact of COVID, which continued to affect both capital equipment sales and utilization in the field, we are pleased with our performance as we have begun to see a meaningful recovery in the business

On the capital equipment side, U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenue grew by 11% over the second quarter of 2020. With restrictions being eased in the third quarter and our virtual marketing and training efforts starting to pay off, our BDMs began to successfully get back into the field to prospect accounts. We are particularly encouraged with the mix of systems sold between TMS-only providers and the traditional psychiatrist office is similar to our historical levels, indicating an increasingly favorable capital sales environment. We anticipate that capital sales will continue to rebound, albeit at a slower rate than we are experiencing with the treatment sessions

Total U.S. treatment session revenue was up 39% sequentially over the second quarter of 2020 and was down just 11% over the third quarter of 2019. We are encouraged by this performance, knowing that approximately 10% of our customers' offices are still not seeing patients in person, but the 90% that are open and starting to see utilization approach pre-COVID levels

Turning to our operational update. On our last call, I laid out our near-term focus areas. As a reminder, they are: first, driving awareness of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy as a safe, effective nondrug therapy for depression; second, putting a focus on driving treatment session revenue by optimizing our commercial organization; and third, developing our indication expansion strategy

As it relates to driving awareness of those psychiatrists who currently utilize NeuroStar Advanced Therapy, the results and feedback are overwhelmingly positive. We are learning during our assessment of the market that awareness of transcranial magnetic stimulation generally and NeuroStar Advanced Therapy specifically for the treatment of MDD is very low, both on the patient and psychiatrist side. This points to a significant opportunity to raise awareness of NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. There are over 26,000 psychiatrist practices in the United States and just 800 have a NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System in their office. The market remains underserved and we will continue to work to penetrate it

Shifting to optimizing our commercial organization. In October, we announced Sara Grubbs as our Vice President of Sales. In my 30 years of managing sales teams, I rank Sara as one of the top sales strategists and tacticians I've had the pleasure to work with. She has developed extensive expertise commercializing medical devices similar to the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy that involve an ongoing sale of consumables and world-class customer support. In particular, while at Zeltiq, she spent time developing and implementing the strategy on both capital and consumable portions of the business before stepping up to run the company's sales strategy for one of the largest U.S. regions. We are excited to have her onboard and believe she is the right person to lead the reformulation of our sales strategy to drive treatment session revenue

We are focused on expanding our base of clinical evidence and developing our indication expansion strategy. In addition to bolstering our commercial leadership, we added other talent aimed at leveraging the huge amount of data available to us, including in the large repository of treatment data within our TrakStar cloud management tool. With over 80% of our treatment sessions captured on the cloud, we have a significant amount of data that is being analyzed to help inform and support our strategy around patient marketing, payer reimbursement and regulatory pathways

In October, clinical data was published in the Journal of Affective Disorders, suggesting that NeuroStar Advanced Therapy could be evaluated as a first-line treatment for MDD. The authors analyzed 2 sample sets from our TrakStar registry, which included more than 5,000 patients across 103 practices, evaluating clinical outcomes data for the treatment with NeuroStar. The author stated that research further validates the efficacy results shown in a prior naturalistic study, which showed a 58% response rate and a 37% remission rate. These results are especially intriguing, considering similar metrics for antidepressant drugs, which, on a whole, have a response rate of 47% and a remission rate of 27% according to the STAR*D data for patients undergoing their first drug therapy

The data continues to demonstrate that NeuroStar Advanced Therapy is a safe and effective treatment for those with depression who have not benefited from antidepressant medications. And importantly, provide physicians with the scientific evidence needed to optimize the treatment of patients with depression. According to the lead author of the study, Dr. Harold Sackeim, the NeuroStar's strong efficacy and the low side effects and medical risk profile suggests that TMS be evaluated as a first-line treatment for MDD. Given that approximately half of the payers who reimburse for NeuroStar Advanced Therapy still require patients to fail 4 courses of drugs before being approved for treatment, the continued collection and publication of data showing the benefits of our therapy is critical

During this year's Clinical TMS Society event, in September, Dr. Scott Aaronson presented a webinar on his pilot study on the treatment of bipolar depression, utilizing NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. His presentation reviewed data from a 2-center open-label prospective trial. He concluded that bipolar depression is most likely an excellent target for the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy. With so few treatments available for the management of bipolar depression, making NeuroStar Advanced Therapy a nondrug treatment option, could be groundbreaking

Overall, we are pleased with our performance during the third quarter. We saw a strong sequential recovery in the business, both in terms of system sales and treatment session volumes. We also have generated some significant momentum internally with the bolstering of our leadership team and the continued development of our industry-leading clinical data. I'm very proud of how the entire organization has adapted to the uncertainty of COVID as well as a change in management. I continue to be energized by the enthusiasm I am seeing out of the team every day

With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Stephen J. Furlong,  Neuronetics, Inc. - VP, CFO &amp; Member of Office of the President   [4]

Thank you, Keith. Total revenue for the quarter was $12.4 million, up 28% on a sequential basis over the second quarter of 2020. Compared to the prior year, third quarter revenue was down 22%, primarily as a result of COVID-19, related governmental responses and resulting economic turmoil, which persisted throughout the quarter. U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenue was $2.5 million, up 9% on a sequential basis over the second quarter of 2020. Compared to the prior year, third quarter U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenue was down 45%, primarily driven by a lower number of NeuroStar systems sold during the quarter

In the quarter, the company sold 39 systems, down from 68 in the third quarter of 2019 as a result of the impact of COVID-19. During the quarter, we saw our installed base increase by 11% over the prior year quarter to 1,143 systems, a net increase of 111 systems from the third quarter of 2019 and a net increase of 21 systems since June 30, 2020

U.S. treatment session revenue was $9.1 million, up 39% on a sequential basis over the second quarter of 2020. Compared to the prior year, U.S. treatment session revenue was only down 11%. The average revenue per system was approximately $8,100 during the third quarter of 2020 compared to approximately $10,500 in the prior year quarter. Both of these declines were driven by psychiatrists temporarily shifting to telemedicine

Gross margin for the third quarter of 2020 was 78.7% compared to the third quarter 2019 gross margin of 73.8%. This significant increase was due to a higher mix of treatment session revenue as well as a reduction in field service costs during the quarter

Operating expenses during the quarter were $12.2 million, a decrease of $5.9 million or 33% compared to the third quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to reduced sales and marketing expenses as well as reduced research and development costs. On a sequential basis, operating expenses decreased $2.1 million from the second quarter of 2020 as a result of the full realization of our cost-saving initiatives implemented in April

Net loss for the third quarter of 2020 was $3.4 million or $0.18 per share as compared to a net loss of $6.9 million or $0.37 per share during the third quarter of 2019. EBITDA for the third quarter of 2020 was negative $2.2 million as compared to negative $5.6 million for the third quarter of 2019

Moving to the balance sheet. Throughout much of this year, we focused on having adequate capital resources and liquidity to support the business over both the near and long term. As of September 30, cash and cash equivalents were $50.7 million. We continue to believe that cash on hand provides us the capital necessary to get to breakeven

Now turning to guidance. For the fourth quarter of 2020, we expect revenue in the range of $13 million to $13.5 million as we continue to expect to see sequential improvement in the business during the quarter. The company continues to project total 2020 operating expenses for the full year to be in the range of $59 million to $61 million

I would now like to turn the call back over to Keith

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Keith J. Sullivan,  Neuronetics, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Director   [5]

Thanks, Steve. Moving to our thoughts on the balance of 2020 as well as 2021. Since joining the company in July, we have made a lot of progress throughout the organization. There is still heavy lifting to be done around the development and implementation of our commercial strategy, but we have put the right people and process in place to drive the strategy forward

As mentioned on our last call, we have engaged a market research firm to identify the proper target audience, the messaging that resonates with them and the most efficient way to communicate with them. Ultimately, our goal is to arm our NPCs with the tools and business development strategies to help customers drive increased patient volume and educate patients on the benefit of the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy as a safe, effective, nondrug therapy for the treatment of MDD. We will have results of the study in late Q4 and look forward to providing an update on the results on our fourth quarter call

In addition to developing the new communication strategy, we are currently in the process of optimizing our sales organization. We will be making decisions around the structure of our sales force, which relates specifically to the ratio of BDMs to NPCs as well as decisions around the expansion of the sales force more broadly. Specifically, we are planning to redefine our BDM territories to better optimize the volume of potential customers' accounts each BDM can cover. We will also align the NPC territories to allow them to have more meaningful impact in driving patient volumes into existing customers. These decisions will be completed shortly, and we expect to selectively hire new BDMs and NPCs during the fourth quarter with the goal of having those new reps onboard and trained ahead of our national sales kickoff meeting during the fourth week of January 2021

Outside of our commercial organization, we have momentum building in other areas, such as reimbursement, clinical data development and indication expansion, which we believe will act as tailwinds for the business in the coming quarters. From that perspective, while we continue to expect solid execution in the fourth quarter and during the first half of 2021, we believe that we will start to see more material positive inflections towards the back half of 2021. We would look forward to providing more robust overview of our strategy for 2021 on our fourth quarter call

I'd like to take a moment and acknowledge the tremendous mental strain that this ongoing pandemic has caused across the U.S. There has been a significant disruption within almost every facet of our lives. In an article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, or JAMA, in October, it was stated that in a June 2020 survey of over 5,400 adults, it was found that 40.9% of the respondents reported at least 1 adverse mental or behavioral health condition, which included depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress and substance abuse. These reported rates were 3 to 4x higher than last year. The need for treatment options to help those suffering from psychiatric disorders has never been greater, and we will continue to work diligently to ensure that as many patients as possible can get relief with NeuroStar Advanced Therapy

With the quarter under my belt at the organization, I am very excited about the future of Neuronetics. We are in a very unique position. We are the market leader in an industry that is largely underpenetrated. We have a large and growing set of clinical data pointing to the efficacy of the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy, and we have a highly experienced team throughout the organization with a proven track record

On top of all that, in early learnings from our market research, we have found that few psychiatrists or patients are aware of transcranial magnetic stimulation or NeuroStar Advanced Therapy as a treatment option for depression. Taken all together, we have a massive opportunity in front of us to bring relief to a significant population of patients who are struggling with drug-resistant depression and potentially other psychiatric disorders

With that, I'd like to open the line for questions

As you may be aware, Kaleido does not typically hold conference calls concurrent with quarterly financial results. However, given the number of topics to review today and their timing with quarter end, we decided this is the most appropriate forum for discussion. Going forward, we intend to host calls and webcast as appropriate based on news flow and clinical data

I will now turn the call over to Kaleido's Executive Chair, Mike Bonney

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Michael W. Bonney,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Executive Chair &amp; Office of Ceo   [3]

Thank you, Amy, and good morning to everyone. First, our thoughts are with those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we are grateful to all the health care workers and those that support them for their selfless efforts to support patients during this challenging time. It is important to note that the safety of patients, health care professionals and our employees remains our top priority during these trying times

On the call this morning, Alison and Kate, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Medical Officer and Head of R&amp;D, respectively, will discuss one of the most exciting and compelling opportunities I've had the privilege to be part of in my nearly 40 years in the biopharmaceutical industry: the initiation of the COVID-19 clinical program utilizing our product candidate, KB109

The aim of the clinical program is to determine if this MMT, KB109, can alter the course of the disease in a newly diagnosed mild to moderate cohort of patients infected

(technical difficulty)
 KB109, specifically, are well suited to this endeavor. Product platform and KB 109 specifically, are well suited for this endeavor. We are thrilled to be part of a worldwide effort to better understand and moderate the course of this dev data in the fourth quarter of this year, heralds a broader move to explore the impact of various MMTs on diseases involving immune and inflammatory pathways

Another product candidate from our library, KB295, will be studied in a clinical trial of ulcerative colitis. We expect data from that clinical trial in mid-2021

This new set of strategic priorities adds to our work in UCD and hepatic encephalopathy with KB195 and KB174, respectively. Now over to Alison for more details on the rationale and study design for these exciting new clinical trials. Alison?;;

Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [4]

Thanks, Mike. COVID-19 is
 (technical difficulty)
 unprecedented global impact on health and health care facilities. We continue to adapt our work to help prioritize the safety of employees, patients and clinical staff, and we understand the need for study sites to limit certain activities in light of the ongoing pandemic. We are fortunate with our product platform and efficient discovery and development that Kaleido has both the opportunity and flexibility in responding to these developments. And in fact, we're uniquely positioned to advance the number of pipeline programs, for which we expect to deliver data over the next 18 months

The burden of COVID-19 pandemic is vast, and there remains an opportunity for interventional studies in patients with mild to moderate disease, a population which represents the majority of those infected. There is also a need for a convenient, orally administered, well-tolerated product that has the potential to augment the patient's own immune system to fight the immune-mediated pathology of this disease and avoid more serious complications of the infection and the need for hospitalization

We are initiating 2 non-IND controlled clinical studies of our MMT, KB109, that is designed to evaluate the effects of supportive self-care plus KB109 compared to supportive self-care alone in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 infection who are not hospitalized. The program includes both a multicenter study of approximately 350 patients and a second study of approximately 50 patients, which will also evaluate the composition and metabolites of patients' microbiome

In both studies, patients will be randomized to either receive supportive self-care, the control group, or supportive self-care plus KB109 for 2 weeks, and then will be followed for 3 weeks. These studies will include assessments of clinical outcomes, health care utilization and biomarkers of the inflammatory response that may also help inform the potential of KB109 in other viral respiratory and bacterial infection. We look forward to initial top line results from the multicenter study in Q4 of this year

KB109 highlights the flexibility of our MMT platform. MMTs like KB109 are designed to drive the function and distribution of the microbiomes' existing microbes in order to decrease or increase the production of metabolites and to advantage or disadvantage certain bacteria in the microbiome community. MMT candidates that targeted synthetic glycans that are orally administered have limited systemic exposure and are selectively metabolized by enzymes in the microbiota. These characteristics of MMTs enable an efficient clinical development path, which allows us to move candidates rapidly from discovery into clinical studies under regulation supporting research with food

Strong scientific rationale and data generated to date with KB109, paired with the flexibility of this path, has enabled us to move quickly into an area of high unmet medical need

I will now turn the call over to Kate Knobil, our Chief Medical Officer and Head of R&amp;D, for additional details on the COVID-19 clinical studies and the scientific rationale behind this new program

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Katharine Knobil,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Chief Medical Officer and Head of Research &amp; Development   [5]

Thanks, Alison. We are delighted to be collaborating with the University of Massachusetts Medical School and Center for Microbiome Research on our COVID-19 program, along with a number of other clinical centers in the United States. As you've just heard, the 2 studies will enroll approximately 400 outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, who will be randomized to either supportive self-care or supportive self-care plus KB109 orally for 2 weeks, followed by 3 weeks of follow-up

In addition to assessing safety and tolerability, patients will monitor objective measures, such as temperature and oxygen levels and participate in telemedicine visits with clinicians. We will also be collecting data on clinical outcomes, health care utilization and biomarkers of the inflammatory response that may help inform the potential of KB109 in other respiratory viral infections and, more broadly, on the impact of MMTs on the immune system. The study of approximately 50 patients has a similar study design but will also evaluate changes in the composition and the metabolic output of the patient's gut microbiomes

The data and scientific rationale for evaluating KB109 and COVID-19 are compelling. This infection has been associated with activation of an inappropriate inflammatory cascade, which in some patients can cause an abnormally aggressive immune response that can lead to pneumonia and respiratory failure. Increased short-chain fatty acids, which are created by fermentation of glycans by the gut microbiome, have been shown in preclinical models to influence immune pathways and mitigate immune pathology associated with severe respiratory viral infections, including reducing mortality from lethal influenza virus infection. These studies have also demonstrated that short chain fatty acid producing taxa induce virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell and antibody responses involved in the reduction of the severity of viral infection, as well as influencing macrophage functionality to mitigate neutrophil-mediated tissue damage

There are also human data to support the role of short-chain fatty acids in reducing the impact of viral infections. In patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplants who have contracted respiratory viral infection, including coronavirus, the presence of short-chain fatty acid producing taxa has been associated with the significantly reduced risk of progression to lower respiratory tract infections, which can have significant morbidity in this patient population

MMTs are novel glycans that are synthesized to enable precise modulation of the taxonomic composition of the gut microbiome, as well as its metabolic output. Specifically, MMTs promote a beneficial short-chain fatty acid profile in the gut and promote the growth of taxa that has the potential to support the host's ability to mount an appropriate immune and inflammatory response, while also preventing an overaggressive hyperinflammatory state, up to and including cytokine storm

KB109 was selected for evaluation in the COVID-19 clinical program based on its demonstrated ability ex vivo to increase the production of short-chain fatty acids, as well as to promote commensals while reducing pathogenic bacteria. We're looking forward to the initial top line data from this important program in the fourth quarter of this year

Alison, back over to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Alison Lawton,  Kaleido Biosciences, Inc. - Special Advisor For Office of CEO &amp; Director   [6]

Thanks, Kate. With the progress we've had in KB109 resources on the COVID-19 program, Kaleido has elected to pose the Vitora clinical study of KB109 in patients colonized with multidrug-resistant pathogens. We are evaluating next steps for our pathogen program, including a future potential clinical study in a patient population at high risk of infection, such as in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant

Beyond KB109, we are expanding our efforts with our immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases to further understand the potential application of our MMT platform. We plan to initiate a clinical study evaluating a new MMT candidate, KB295, in approximately 30 patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis or UC. UC is linked to microbiome dysbiosis and microbiome restoration has been shown to lead to clinical remission in patients. Short-chain fatty acids are consistently observed as down-regulated in UC patients. Clinical studies administering inulin-glycans have demonstrated an improvement in active UC associated with an increase in short-chain fatty acids

KB295 has shown an ability to increase production of short-chain fatty acids while also reducing the presence of inflammatory bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae also linked to UC. Patients in this single-site study will be evaluated over 56 days of treatment and 14 days of follow-up. We will be looking at safety and tolerability as well as impacts on the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index. Exploratory endpoints include changes in microbiome taxa, short-chain fatty acids levels in stool and serological biomarkers of inflammation. We've been working closely with the European sites of this study and incorporating remote monitoring into the design. And along with the recent IRB approval for the protocol, we are confident we will have top line results in the middle of 2021

Turning now to KB195, which is currently being evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial called UNLOCKED, in patients with urea cycle disorders who are inadequately controlled on standard of care. Given the limitations on patient visits and the impact of COVID-19 on new patient enrollment, we now anticipate the data from this study will most likely be available in the second half of 2021. More than 20 sites are currently activated in 8 countries, and we have submitted an amendment to expand the eligibility age criteria for enrollment of patients aged 12 instead of previously 18 and up to the age of 70 instead of previously 65

With respect to our KB174 program in hepatic encephalopathy, we are ready to initiate the next clinical study in patients with the disease. However, the study initiation is dependent on partnering the program and the resolution of COVID-19 impact at trial sites

In addition to our clinical programs, we have a number of preclinical programs where we expect to have clinical-ready lead MMTs identified in 2021. This will position us well for either potential partnerships or to begin new clinical program

With our immuno-oncology program, our goal is to identify MMT candidate that stimulate the targeted therapeutic response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced preclinical models. We are collaborating with Gustave Roussy, a leading center for oncology immunotherapy in Europe, and we anticipate the selection of lead compounds based on data from our preclinical work in Q4 of this year

We also plan to have preclinical data from validated models of additional immune-mediated diseases that will identify new clinical-ready lead MMT candidates in the first half of 2021. And we continue preclinical work for our cardio-metabolic and liver disease program are on track for results from validated models in Q4 of 2020

Before we take questions, I want to mention that we ended the first quarter with $53.8 million cash on hand, and we continue to manage our operating expenses in line with our pipeline priorities. And as a result, we've extended our cash runway further into the first quarter of 2021. The next 18 months are very important for Kaleido as we continue to translate the promise of the microbiome into solutions for patients. We look forward to key upcoming data milestones, including clinical results from our larger COVID-19 study in Q4; results from our KB295 study in UC in mid-2021; and our Phase II clinical results from our KB195 study in UCD in the second half of next year

Now I'd like the operator to open up the call for your questions

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Shaw Communications' Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Conference Call

Today's call will be hosted by Mr. Brad Shaw, CEO of Shaw Communications. (Operator Instructions) The conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)
 Before we begin, management would like to remind listeners that comments made during today's call will include forward-looking information, and there are risks that actual results could differ materially. Please refer to the company's publicly filed documents for more details on assumptions and risks

Mr. Shaw, I will now turn the call over to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Non Independent Director   [2]

Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. And with me are members of our senior management team, including Jay, Vito and Trevor

We are pleased this morning to report strong financial results for our third quarter and also share some comments and thoughts regarding the recent transactions we announced on June 13. We believe that both transactions are optimizing the value and strategic positioning of our portfolio of assets and will generate long-term benefits for all of our stakeholders, including our employees, customers and shareholders

Our results this quarter highlight our unwavering commitment to the execution of our long-term strategic plan. We also emphasize that at Shaw, we are putting our customers' future connectivity needs at the center of every strategic decision we make as we focus on growth opportunities in front of us. We are building a best-in-class converged network, driving product innovation and value through industry-leading services such as WideOpen Internet 150 and BlueSky TV and enhancing our capabilities and capacity to offer Canadians a more affordable and robust wireless experience

In the quarter, within our Consumer division, we gained approximately 13,000 cable video subscribers, returning to growth for the first time since 2010. We also delivered a net gain of approximately 21,000 Internet customers, a net loss of approximately 2,000 phone customers and a net gain of approximately 7,000 satellite RGUs. Collectively, our Consumer and Wireless divisions had a net gain of 58,000 RGUs in the quarter, or 64,000 subscribers, including BNS growth

This substantial year-over-year improvement is attributed to several factors. We focused on our network and launched WideOpen Internet 150 across Shaw's entire cable footprint. We also provided price certainty through compelling bundle and value plan offerings, which are driving notable reductions in disconnects. We modernized the television viewing experience and mass launched the BlueSky TV in April across Shaw's entire footprint

BlueSky is more than just a new set-top box or a voice remote. BlueSky TV is a revolutionary TV viewing experience that listens, learns and curates preferred content through an intuitive and modern interface, leveraging the power of voice. Over time, we believe this platform, through our partnership with Comcast, will become the digital hub for the home

We've rolled out our LTE-Advanced network ahead of schedule, and it's now nearing completion. And our LTE handset lineup continues to expand and currently features LG, Samsung and Sony

Freedom Mobile continues to release key enhancements that improve a customer experience, such as Wi-Fi calling, which provides customers the ability to make calls at no cost from outside their cellular calling area

As many of you are aware, 2 weeks ago, we announced a share purchase agreement with GI Partners' portfolio company, Peak 10 Holding, to sell 100% of our wholly owned subsidiary, ViaWest, for approximately $2.3 billion. The ViaWest acquisition in 2014 marked a pivotal moment in Shaw's history and provided a growth engine which has delivered and continues to deliver strong results. The outlook for ViaWest remains robust

Though the North American co-location and managed service industry is consolidating and scale is becoming an important factor for continued long-term success, we believe the combination of ViaWest and Peak 10 creates a platform for growth and ensures the combined entity's customers and employees are well positioned for the future. I would like to thank Nancy, her management team and all 600 of ViaWest employees for their commitment and dedication during the 3 years of Shaw's ownership

We also announced a definitive agreement with Quebecor to acquire their 700 megahertz and 2,500 megahertz wireless spectrum licenses for a total of $430 million. The addition of the low-band spectrum is a significant milestone towards improving network coverage and quality across Alberta, British Columbia and Southern Ontario. Canadians will benefit through the deployment of this additional spectrum in our continued efforts to offer a truly facilities-based competition and an affordable wireless services on a more robust network

Before my closing remarks, I will now turn it over -- the call to Vito to go through the financial results for the third quarter. Vito?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP   [3]

Thanks, Brad, and good morning to all of you for joining us on the call

The reported consolidated results for the quarter include revenue of $1.31 billion, up 2.8%; and EBITDA of $550 million, down 0.5% on a year-over-year basis

Looking at the divisional details. Consumer revenue of $930 million in the quarter was down 0.5%, while EBITDA of $401 million was down 6.1% compared to the prior year

BNS results delivered revenue of $137 million, up 7%; and EBITDA of $70 million, up 9.4% over the prior year. Excluding legacy satellite services, our core business revenue increased 10% in the current quarter

Wireless results in the quarter include revenue of $154 million, up 16.7%; and EBITDA of $42 million, up 44.8% compared to the prior year

Consolidated CapEx in the quarter was $323 million. The increased CapEx in the current quarter compared to a year ago is due primarily to broadband and wireless spending

Free cash flow of $132 million for the quarter decreased from $182 million a year ago, primarily as a result of higher planned CapEx spend and lots of free cash flow generated in the prior year by the former Media division

Considering our progress to date, we have refined our fiscal 2017 guidance as follows. We expect EBITDA will be between $2.135 billion and $2.16 billion. We expect CapEx will approximate $1.35 billion and we will deliver free cash flow of approximately $400 million. Please note that these refinements include the results of BIS through to the end of fiscal 2017

With the sale of ViaWest and the acquisition of spectrum, we expect pro forma net debt to operating income before restructuring cost and amortization to be below the low end of its target 2.0 to 2.5x and our $1.5 billion credit facility to be fully undrawn. Considering all the moving parts, we believe we've significantly enhanced Shaw's strategic and financial flexibility moving forward. We're excited about our long-term wireless and wireline growth prospects

With that, I'll hand the call back to Brad for closing comments

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Non Independent Director   [4]

Thanks, Vito. Q3 is another milestone for us as we focused on execution of our strategic road map, delivered wireline subscriber growth and made foundational investments to support and improve our network. During this transformational time, I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to all Shaw employees. Thank you for your unwavering dedication to creating exceptional customer experiences and delivering against our strategic initiative of becoming Canada's leading connectivity provider

Thank you for joining us this morning, and we now turn it back to the operator to open for Q&amp;A

Operator   [1]

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Shaw Communications Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2017 Conference Call. Today's call will be hosted by Mr. Brad Shaw, CEO of Shaw Communications. (Operator Instructions) The conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)
 Before we begin, management would like to remind listeners that comments made during today's call will include forward-looking information, and there are risks that actual results could differ materially. Please refer to the companies publicly filed documents for more details on assumptions and risks

Mr. Shaw, I'll now turn the call over to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Non Independent Director   [2]

Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me this morning are members of our senior management team, including Jay Mehr and Vito Culmone

Our asset-based strategic partnerships and long-term outlook have never been stronger. We believe our focus in 2017 has enabled the significant progress we have made on our key strategic initiatives. We're excited about the growth opportunities in both our wireless and wireline businesses. We will continue to make the necessary investments to bring both businesses together into a single experience for Canadians, as our converged network becomes a reality over the coming years

During fiscal 2017, we monetized our U.S. data center business at an attractive valuation and bought additional spectrum from Quebecor. While the spectrum will significantly enhance our current network capabilities, the addition of future low band spectrum remains critical to level the playing field and for Shaw to be a viable long-term competitor in the wireless space. Considering the realities of our spectrum position and how the incumbents have historically secured this key asset required to compete in the wireless business, particularly the low-frequency spectrum, we strongly support the government's proposed approach to the 600-megahertz auction. The framework will help ensure that Canadians have affordable and competitive choices for years to come. While we are proud of the improvements we have made to the Freedom network, a substantial set aside in upcoming 600 auction is required for Canadians to truly enjoy choice in their wireless experience. Almost a year ago, we rebranded WIND with a launch of Freedom Mobile, and today more than 1.1 million Canadians choose Freedom as their wireless carrier

In fiscal 2017, we completed the rollout of our LTE network and made Shaw Go WiFi available to Freedom customers, creating immediate and tangible improvements to their wireless experience. This investment created a powerful LTE advanced data only network that we are now offering to Canadians in the way that they have not experienced before

Our approach to the growth of our wireless business has been thoughtful and patient. A highlight of this strategy is that in the near term we will deploy some of our recently acquired spectrum to enable hundreds of thousands of existing Freedom Mobile customers to move from their current 3G data experience to our fast LTE network. This innovative approach to spectrum management will also technically enable millions of Canadians to bring their own devices to Freedom and enjoy the full benefit of our LTE network. And in addition, take advantage of our new Big Gig rate plans. These plans lead the Canadian market in terms of included data value and are perfectly suited for the data-savvy modern wireless customer. Furthering our appeal to this important market segment, we're also excited to confirm that we have finalized the agreement with Apple to bring the iPhone to our wireless customers and we look forward to future announcements on Apple iPhone availability and pricing

Considering these recent announcements, we believe we are significantly expanding our addressable market and, going forward, there will be continued network and product improvements, including the launch of voice-over-LTE by the end of this fiscal year. In 2017, we set out to successfully change the trajectory of our wireline subscriber trends. We delivered positive consumer RGU growth of 25,000 compared to a loss of 170,000 in the previous year. We believe our strength in broadband will continue to grow as our customers see tremendous value in products such as WideOpen 150 and unlimited data. We also delivered positive consumer video adds in F '17, another significant improvement over the loss of approximately 93,000 last year. In April, we launched BlueSky TV, adding a premium TV experience to our video portfolio. The road map that we have in front of us with respect to technology in the home continues to be very exciting and supportive of our strategy to provide an exceptional customer experience. In F '17, we pushed the boundaries with launch of BlueSky TV and WideOpen 150 with unlimited data to grow our wireline business

In order to effect this change, we purposely spent on marketing, the customer premise equipment and we drove promotional activity, all of which we can see in the results, both subscriber and financial

Vito will provide you more details regarding our F '18 guidance, but you can expect a profitable and value-accretive focus regarding our growth initiatives as we continue to make investments to improve both our wireline and wireless businesses

Maintaining investment-grade ratings remains a priority for us. And our ability to fund investments and continue to pay a healthy dividend is supported by our strong balance sheet -- the strongest balance sheet we have ever had, with leverage under 2x and over $500 million in cash available, our financial strength was enhanced through the strategic investments and divestitures over recent years. This purposely designed has enabled us to fund growth initiatives, including wireless infrastructure and spectrum. That allows us to target a wide variety of segments and respond to competitive market dynamics

Fiscal 2017 was another year of significant milestones and achievements. Our strategy and focus on execution has never been clearer, and I'm very confident that we are making the appropriate investment decisions to deliver long-term growth and value for all stakeholders, and I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead

I'll now turn the call over to Vito to review the Q4 and fiscal 2017 financial results, as well as discuss our 2018 guidance. Vito?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP   [3]

Thank you, Brad. And Good morning, everyone. Before I get into the detailed financial results, I would like to remind everyone that Q4 and full year 2017 results have been segmented into continuing operations, comprised of Consumer, BNS and Wireless, as well as discontinued operations, which would include ViaWest, Shaw Tracking and Shaw Media in some of the year-over-year comparisons

Our fiscal 2017 reported revenue and EBITDA from continuing operations in the amount of $4.882 billion and $1.997 billion respectively, represented an increase of 8.1% and 1% versus fiscal 2016. As it relates to Q4, year-over-year consolidated revenue and EBITDA from continuing operations was $1.24 billion and $479 million, respectively. Revenue increased 2.6% and EBITDA decreased 6.8%, as growth in Wireless and BNS were more than offset by higher planned costs in the Consumer division

Let's start with Consumer, as it had the largest impact on this quarter's results. Revenue and EBITDA in Q4 was approximately $937 million and $374 million, respectively. The lower year-over-year EBITDA reflects elevated levels of promotional activity, higher network programming fees, along with increased operational and marketing costs as we continue to create awareness for BlueSky TV. For the full year Consumer revenue of $3.7 billion was down 0.1% from fiscal '16, and EBITDA declined 5% to $1.58 billion as the Consumer segment carried most of the increased cost to launch and service new products, create customer awareness, grow the subscriber base and absorb increases such as programming costs

We are pleased with the subscriber results in F '17, and we've been very thoughtful and deliberate in our promotional strategies, notwithstanding RGU growth came at a cost. We made the necessary investments to reverse the subscriber trends and launch new products and services that we expect will deliver growth over the long term

Business Network Services revenue and EBITDA increased 6.8% and 7.5%, respectively, in the fourth quarter. For the full year, revenue -- reported revenue of $554 million and EBITDA of $281 million, increased to 7.6% and 11.5%, respectively, as customer demand for the smart product suite remained strong

Wireless revenue increased 16.2% to $172 million in the quarter, while EBITDA increased 13.8% to $33 million compared to fiscal '16 Q4. For the year, Wireless generated $605 million in revenue and $133 million in EBITDA. Continued growth in this segment is due primarily to subscriber and ARPU growth as we continue to load customers on our LTE-Advanced network. We're pleased with the growth that Wireless delivered in fiscal '17, and we will continue to build upon this momentum in fiscal '18 and beyond

Turning to capital spending in the quarter, it increased to $398 million or $61 million higher than Q4 fiscal '16, bringing the full-year investment to $1.225 billion for continuing operations. Fiscal 2017 investments were focused around continued improvements to our network to drive growth, including completion of the LTE rollout, integrating Shaw Go WiFi services and launching voice-over-WiFi. We continued to push fiber deeper into their network, invest in DOCSIS 3.1 and maintain the lowest network congestion in our history as we support a significant number of Internet subscribers taking faster speeds

Free cash flow, which includes continuing and discontinuing operations for the year was $438 million, down 9.1% compared to fiscal '16, due mainly to higher capital expenditures in fiscal '17, coupled with free cash flow contribution from Shaw Media in the previous year. Net income in Q4 and for the full year was $481 million and $851 million, respectively. The increase in the quarter reflects a $330 million gain on the sale of ViaWest. On the full year basis, net income was lower primarily due to net income from discontinued operations in fiscal '16, partially offset by higher non-operating gains in fiscal 2017

To sum up the F '17 discussion, let me look back for a moment and touch briefly on our 2017 guidance. As you recall, we provided refined guidance last quarter, which included fiscal '17 EBITDA to range between $2.135 billion and $2.160 billion, capital of $1.35 billion and free cash flow greater than $400 million. By removing the full year impact of ViaWest and Shaw Tracking, which equates to EBITDA of approximately $146 million and capital of approximately $114 million, we delivered reported results in line with the revised 2017 guidance when adjusting for these divestitures

As we look ahead to another year, we will continue to execute on our strategic initiatives and build a best-in-class converged network. We will invest in enabling the newly acquired 725 megahertz spectrum. We will focus on profitable subscriber growth, and we will continue to introduce compelling products and services through our excellent product road map. As always, we will continue the pursuit of operational efficiencies. With that as a backdrop, we're pleased to introduce fiscal '18 guidance as follows

We expect consolidated operating income before restructuring costs and amortization growing to approximately $2.1 billion, a year-over-year projected increase of approximately 5%. Capital investments of approximately $1.38 billion, and free cash flow of approximately $375 million. We expect most of the growth in consolidated operating income before restructuring costs and amortization to occur in the back half of fiscal 2018

I also want to discuss a change in the basis of presentation for fiscal 2018 results. Effective for Q1 fiscal '18, we will be combining the Consumer and BNS divisions, and reporting them as Wireline. Our org design has evolved, and we have integrated the management structures for Consumer in BNS. These changes were made to increase agility and have sufficiencies. As a result, costs, be them operating or network related, are increasingly inseparable between Consumer and BNS. We will, of course, continue to report revenue RGUs and other KPIs for Consumer in BNS. Wireline will remain a separate reporting unit

Finally as Brad mentioned earlier, our balance sheet metrics are strong and we exited fiscal '17 with net debt-to-EBITDA under 2x and over $500 million in cash. Our overall financial position is more than capable of supporting the required strategic investment and support our dividend payments for years to come. With that, Brad, I'll turn the call back for you for closing remarks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Non Independent Director   [4]

Great. Thanks, Vito. Before we turn to questions, we are excited to announce the addition of Mike Sievert, Chief Operating Officer of T-Mobile, who will be joining our Board of Directors at our Annual General Meeting in January. Mike brings a wealth of wireless experience to our board with a strong background in operations and marketing through senior roles in several organizations, including T-Mobile, Clearwire, Microsoft, AT&amp;T and E*TRADE Financial. While Shaw will continue to chart our unique path in offering a differentiated mobile experience for our customers, Mike's breadth and depth of hands-on experience will be an asset to us

We appreciate all of our stakeholders' support as we execute our strategic plan. Our long-term growth orientated strategy is built with our customers' needs at the heart of every decision. We have the financial resources and balance sheet strength to continue to purposefully invest with the view of delighting our customers and delivering value to our shareholders

Thank you, and we turn it over to -- back to you operator for questions

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Shaw Communications First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Conference Call and Webcast. Today's call will be hosted by Mr. Jay Mehr, President of Shaw Communications. (Operator Instructions) And the conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)
 Before we begin, management would like to remind listeners that comments made during today's call will include forward-looking information and there are risks that actual results could differ materially. Please refer to the company's publicly filed documents for more details on assumptions and risks

Mr. Mehr, I would now like to turn the call over to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [2]

Thank you, operator, and happy New Year to everyone joining Vito and myself on the call today. We appreciate everyone being flexible regarding the call -- the timing of the call this morning

Given last week's bad news of the passing of Shaw Communications' Vice Chair and Former CEO, Jim Shaw. Brad and the family are in preparations for his service tomorrow and, therefore, are understandably unavailable related today's conference call. However, Brad did ask me to convey his deepest gratitude to everyone for their kind and thoughtful messages that he's received over the last week

On a personal note, I wanted to take just a moment to express the immense impact that Jim has had on my career and me personally as I spent most of my 23 years at Shaw working alongside Jim. Those of you listening who knew him knew that -- know that he has a larger-than-life personality and was an icon within our industry and the overall Canadian business community. Jim was instrumental to our company's success as he led Shaw Communications as CEO for 12 years and has been part of our business for over 35 years. Jim's significant contributions to this company are evident today and are reflected in our position as a leader in the Canadian industry

Jim was one of my most influential mentors for sure, and I will carry fond memories for -- of him. Our hearts remain heavy with sadness as we say goodbye to a visionary leader and friend. Jim, you will be dearly missed. And I know I speak for every Shaw employee, including myself, when I say we're focused on not letting you down as we continue to build this great company

Moving on to the formal remarks. We've entered fiscal 2018 in an enviable position. Last year, the optimization of our asset base continued as we disposed ViaWest and secured valuable spectrum that enabled us to continue the execution of our long-term strategic initiatives. Our financial position has never been stronger, and we're making significant progress with respect to our wireless and wireline investments. Our customers are our motivation, guiding our actions and are at the center of every decision we make. We continue to invest in our business so that we can offer innovative products and services that will meet their demands and future expectations as well as create value for all stakeholders

Our Wireless business is well situated to deliver growth as we build on the foundation of our LTE-Advanced network; the refarm of our 10 megahertz of AWS-1 spectrum, which was recently completed in Vancouver, Calgary and Edmonton; significantly expanding Freedom's addressable market as this spectrum supports nearly all LTE devices currently in use in Canada. This work is also well underway in Toronto and the GTA. At the same time, the company has also begun deploying the recently acquired 2,500 megahertz spectrum, further improving network quality. With this efficient use of spectrum, over 4 million Canadians in our wireless footprint not in contract can now bring their own device to Freedom Mobile and enjoy the benefit of our LTE-Advanced network

More than ever, customers are acutely aware of the cost of their wireless bills, and until recently, they were forced to accept limited amounts of data as part of their premium-priced wireless service. We launched our Big Gig data plans in October, and consumers, the media and the competition took notice. Not only are we providing customers with options for 10-plus gigabytes of data in their monthly plan but we can do so at a price that is both sustainable for us and affordable to Canadians

We launched the i Phone in early December and have already seen significant improvements in the levels of our acquisition and retention of customers. We are excited that we were able to offer this iconic device prior to the holiday season, and in fact, December sales of iPhones have exceeded our expectations. The increased customer demand since launching Big Gig and the i Phone continue to highlight the desire from customers to get more data for less and supports our overall wireless growth strategy

Throughout F '18, we will continue to enhance the wireless experience as we deploy our 2,500 and 700 megahertz spectrum across our footprint, improving both the quality and coverage aspect of the network, as well as launching VoLTE by the end of the fiscal year. We also continue to improve the breadth of our current wireless distribution, including increased marketing support for our recently launched online sales channel. We believe all of these factors, including our network and distribution improvements, iPhone carriage and attractive data packages, will have a meaningful impact on our subscriber loading compared to the historical results since completing the acquisition of WIND in March 2016

In our Wireline Consumer business, we've delivered a sixth consecutive quarter of Internet RGU growth, primarily due to the success of our flagship WideOpen Internet 150 product, which is available to over 99% of our footprint. Today, over 90% of our new Internet customers are taking speeds of 75 megabits per second or higher, and over half of those are opting for a 2-year ValuePlan. The strength of our network is evident in our broadband subscriber results, and we expect the trend to continue as we meet and exceed the demands of our customers

Video results reflect our balanced approach to subscriber growth and retention. We have reduced our promotional activity and focused our efforts this quarter on higher-value video subscribers. We continue to be excited about our premium TV service, BlueSky, now fully integrated with Netflix; and the BlueSky roadmap, which enables further innovation, transforming the video landscape

Shaw Business continues to deliver consistent growth, and the success that we're experiencing in this segment is primarily due to our smart portfolio of managed services that focus on small to medium-size businesses. In December, we launched a fourth product in this portfolio, Smart Surveillance. Through our best-in-class partner approach, we will continue to provide innovative products and services that complement our connectivity services

I will now turn the call over to Vito to review the Q1 fiscal 2018 results

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO   [3]

Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the detailed financial results, I would like to remind listeners that effective Q1 of this year, our reporting consists of 2 separate segments: Wireless, which has not changed from previous disclosure; and Wireline that now combines Consumer and Business. We will continue to provide separate revenue and RGU metrics for each of Consumer and Business, and EBITDA will be a combined result on the basis that costs have become increasingly inseparable between the 2 segments

On a consolidated basis, first quarter revenue of $1.25 billion increased 2.7% and EBITDA decreased 4.6% to $481 million over the comparable period. Let's review each segment in more detail. Starting with Wireless. Revenue of $175 million in the quarter increased by $37 million or 26.8%, and EBITDA of $35 million increased 16.7% over this same period in fiscal 2017

The improvement in Wireless is primarily related to the increase in subscribers of approximately 130,000 relative to a year ago for a total wireless customer base of almost 1.2 million as at the end of November. It's important to note that many of the positive developments Jay referred to earlier, such as the iPhone launch and the spectrum refarm, are subsequent to the quarter end and, therefore, has no impact on the current quarter results

In Wireline, Consumer revenue declined to $935 million or down 1.3% while Business revenue increased 6.1% to $140 million. Wireline EBITDA of $446 million declined 5.9% over the comparable period. The decline in year-over-year results was primarily driven by consumer video as the impact of increased promotional activity that took place in the second half of fiscal 2017 as well as higher planned corporate costs more than offset growth in Internet and Business. While overall Wireline results were down year-over-year, Consumer Internet and Business remained important growth drivers

Capital spending in the quarter increased to $353 million or $84 million higher than Q1 fiscal '17. More than half of the increase was driven by wireless network investments, including spectrum refarming, deployment of 2,500 small cell coverage and maintenance

Free cash flow in the first quarter of $51 million compares to $158 million in the prior quarter -- excuse me, in the prior year. The decline in the current quarter is due to increased network investment and lower Wireline EBITDA. Net income for the quarter of $114 million compared to $89 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase reflects the prior period nonoperating loss, partially offset by lower EBITDA and higher income taxes in the current quarter. We continue to have significant flexibility as leverage remains at under 2.0x, and we have approximately $445 million of cash and $1.5 billion in liquidity through undrawn lines of credit

In summary, we delivered first quarter results in line with our expectations and consistent with our message from last quarter. We remain committed to our balanced approach in Wireline, and we'll focus our efforts and spend on higher-quality subscribers. We can also confirm that we remain on track to meet F '18 guidance, whereby we expect consolidated operating income before restructuring costs and amortization to go to approximately $2.1 billion, a year-over-year projected increase of approximately 5%; capital investments of approximately $1.38 billion; and free cash flow of approximately $375 million. I also want to remind everyone that we expect the majority of the EBITDA growth to come in the second half of fiscal '18, consistent with our messaging that we provide -- when we provided guidance back in October

Let me provide you with a bit more detail on the growth drivers in the balance of the year. Wireline EBITDA growth ramps in the second half of the year due primarily to improved broadband margins. We see continued migration to higher Internet tiers. And as you saw in November, we increased the effective average Internet pricing, including ValuePlans, through a combination of a reduced promotional period and pricing increases. We continue to believe that our Internet products have pricing power as customers increasingly expect a fast and reliable Internet service. Our Business segment is expected to deliver consistent top line growth with strong margins. And in our Wireless business, we expect to increase our subscriber base and load more customers onto $50-plus rate plans as a result of the network enhancements and the Big Gig data plans

With that, I'll turn the call back to Jay for some closing remarks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [4]

Thanks, Vito. We spent several years laying the foundation for growth, and the potential opportunities for our business have never been better. Amidst the unrelenting pace of change, disruption and competition, we remain focused on execution and staying the course. I firmly believe we have a winning combination of products and services combined with the talented management team that will deliver growth for all stakeholders

Thank you. And we'll turn it back to the operator for questions

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Shaw Communications Second Quarter Fiscal 2018 Conference Call and Webcast. Today's call will be hosted by Mr. Brad Shaw, CEO of Shaw Communications. (Operator Instructions) And the conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)
 Before we begin, management would like to remind listeners that comments made on today's call will include forward-looking information and there are risks that actual results could differ materially. Please refer to the company's publicly filed documents for more details on assumptions and risks

Mr. Shaw, I will now turn the call over to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [2]

Great. Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. With me today are members of our senior management team, including Jay Mehr, President; Vito Culmone, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; Trevor English, Executive Vice President, Chief Strategy and Business Development officer; and Paul McAleese, President, Wireless

This morning, we released our second quarter fiscal 2018 operating and financial results, which includes a record quarter for Wireless with postpaid net additions of over 93,000. This strong subscriber performance reflects a number of key strategic priorities delivered by our team over the recent months, including the introduction of the iPhone in the quarter, the enthusiasm surrounding our data-centered plans and the favorable customer response to our continued network and service improvements. Besides record subscriber additions, we also realized a 5.5% improvement in blended ARPU compared to a year ago. We remain committed to improving the wireless experience for our customers. Our investments have included an upgrade to an LTE advanced network, acquisition and initial deployment of additional spectrum, expansion of our handset lineup and providing customers more data for less through our Big Gig data plans. I'm pleased to confirm additional enhancements that have just been finalized, including the agreement with Loblaws' The Mobile Shop to expand our wireless distribution approximately 100 of their locations across Canada. And just a few weeks ago, we completed the refarm of 10 megahertz of AWS-1 spectrum in the East

Looking forward, we remain on track to have the VoLTE launched in fiscal 2018. And we continue deployment of our 700 megahertz spectrum, which will roll out in fiscal 2019

We also commend the federal government on its support for strong and sustainable competition as reflected in the recent announcement of the set-aside for the upcoming 600 megahertz option. This decision will ensure a future for wireless competition in Canada and is a significant win for all Canadians who deserve more from their wireless services

Moving to Wireline, which really is the foundation of this company and has been built through decades of hard work by thousands of Shaw employees. I'm proud of what we've accomplished. Together, we have built a company with our customers at the center and over the years delivered a high-touch customer service model with a professional installed approach, supported with a manual fulfillment anchored through a powerful and ubiquitous network. It was the right thing to do, and we built our business on this foundation. It is with this same day-to-day operational focus that we will evolve our delivery of products and services that is a digital by default, primarily self-installed and continue network investments targeted to customer value

Total Business Transformation is at its core about our focus on the basics: Customer experience, truck rolls and our network. Said another way, the 3 key elements of our focus going forward include a shift of customer interactions to digital platforms, drive more self-installs and streamline the organization that builds and services our network. Through this process, we have realigned the senior management structure to better support our key areas of focus, which includes Consumer, Business and Wireless. But this -- while this does not change any of our external reporting, the realignment provides leaders of each unit additional scope, oversight and accountability for driving their respective businesses. A significant initiative under our transformation roadmap is the Voluntary Departure Program. While approximately 3,300 employees elected to participate, the program was designed, whereby executing on the 3 key elements outlined earlier, addresses the vast majority of the staff departures

We remain confident that through the next 18 months, and which has been extended to 24 months in some circumstances, we can manage the transition with limited disruption to our day-to-day business operations

When I look at Shaw, at the Shaw we have built, I remain so excited about our strategic direction and the opportunities ahead. We have a Wireless business with tremendous growth opportunity and a step-by-step strategic operating plan that is delivering results in a meaningful way. We have invested in a strong Wireline network that supports the products and services that we provide to both residential and business customers, and we have a strong management team and dedicated employees that will lead us through our focus on the fundamentals of our business. We will be an organization that is leaner, more agile and in the strongest possible position to capitalize on opportunities that we have in front of us

I will now turn the call over to Vito to review the Q2 fiscal 2018 results

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP &amp; CFO   [3]

Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. On a consolidated basis, second quarter revenue of $1.36 billion increased 12.4%, led by significantly higher Wireless revenue and continued growth in Business Internet. Consolidated EBITDA of $501 million was essentially flat over the comparable period. Let's review each segment in more detail

Starting with Wireless, the second quarter results marked a significant departure from historical results as the combination of all the investments we have made in our Wireless business are beginning to have a material impact on our subscriber numbers and our financial results. Total Wireless revenue of $290 million in the quarter increased by $149 million or 106% as equipment revenue went from $24 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 to $148 million in the current quarter

Service revenue also increased by 21% to $142 million as more customers are on Big Gig plans, resulting in year-over-year Wireless ARPU growth of 5.5% to $38.43

Second quarter Wireless EBITDA of $36 million increased 24% over the same period in fiscal 2017. The recorded Wireless margin was 12.4% in the quarter compared to 20.6% in the previous quarter -- excuse me, in the previous year due to the significant increase in equipment revenue as a percentage of overall Wireless revenue

While the success of our device pricing and packaging plans increased our level of subsidy relative to previous quarters, we view this as an attractive investment to profitably grow our subscriber base, and we clearly have a healthy balance sheet to support this, with approximately $275 million of cash on hand and net debt to EBITDA of 2.0x as at the end of February 2018

Moving to Wireline. Year-over-year Consumer revenue declined by 0.8% to $926 million, while Business revenue increased 5.3% to $140 million. Wireline EBITDA of $465 million declined 1.9% compared to Q2 fiscal 2017 but improved by $19 million or 4.2% from Q1 fiscal 2018, reflecting our focus on costs

Consumer results reflect positive Internet growth offset by declines in both video and phone. During the second quarter, we added approximately 5,500 Internet RGUs, and we increased Internet pricing for new customers as we remain focused on balancing RGU growth and profitability

Video revenue and RGUs declined in the quarter as customers generally continued a shift into lower-priced packages

With the launch of BlueSky and the X1 platform, we focused on executing a renewal in subscriber growth similar to the results of our U.S. partners when they launched the program a number of years ago. The consumer context has changed. Our competitive environment is very different, and we do not achieve -- we did not achieve the same outcomes. BlueSky and the X1 platform are best-in-class platform that our customers overwhelmingly recommend, and we're pivoting our focus to optimize our video offerings for profitability

Business results, which include revenue up by 5.3% and RGU growth of approximately 5,700, were led again by the continued success with our smart suite of products as well as traditional Internet, video and data services. With the success we've experienced with our smart products in the SME market, we've recently expanded these services to make them available to enterprise customers

Capital spending in the quarter increased by 7% to $288 million, driven by increases in both Wireline and Wireless investment. Current quarter Wireless capital of $56 million reflects continued investments in spectrum refarming and deployment as well as back office system upgrades. Wireline capital spending of $233 million reflect increases in new housing development and success-based capital

Free cash flow in the second quarter of $135 million compares to $147 million in the prior year. The decline in the current quarter is due to $19 million of higher planned capital expenditures

As it relates to TBT and the pending departure of approximately 3,300 employees, we recognized a $417 million restructuring charge in the current quarter, although the actual timing of the payments will occur over a 24-month period

The run rate annualized savings net of reinvestment specifically related to the voluntary departure program is expected to be approximately $215 million, comprised of 60% operating expenses and 40% capital expenditures to be fully realized in fiscal 2020. The F '18 impact of the VDP expected savings is approximately $48 million from the exit of roughly 1,200 employees before the end of this fiscal year

Net loss for the quarter of $164 million compared to net income of $147 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease substantially reflects the restructuring-related costs recorded during the current quarter in respect of TBT and the related voluntary departure packages

In summary, the first half of fiscal 2018 was in line with our expectations, and throughout the rest of the year, we remain committed to our balanced approach, focusing our efforts and spend on high-quality subscribers and growth opportunities

With that, I'm pleased to confirm that we remain on track to meet F '18 guidance, whereby we expect consolidated operating income before restructuring costs and amortization to grow to approximately $2.1 billion, a year-over-year projected increase of 5 -- approximately 5%. Capital investments of approximately $1.83 billion and free cash flow of approximately $375 million. Our guidance includes certain assumptions related to cost reductions that will be achieved through TBT initiatives, specifically the VDP, roaming cost reductions associated with the CRTC finalized wholesale wireless roaming rates of $12 million, expected to be realized in the third quarter and short-term incremental costs associated with growth in wireless handset sales

Finally, before I hand the call back to Brad, I'd like to make a few closing remarks. It's been an incredible, fulfilling and enjoyable 3 years for me at Shaw. To our investor community and external stakeholders, I want to share the confidence I have in Trevor as he takes on his new role of CFO. It's been an absolute pleasure working alongside him during my tenure, and I've immense respect for his deep understanding of Shaw's business, the industry and our stakeholders' expectations. To Brad, JR and the entire Shaw family, thank you for giving me the opportunity to be part of such a special team during what I truly believe has been a transformative time for our organization

I'm so proud of the work we've undertaken. And as today's results and those still to come will demonstrate, we're emerging from it stronger and with a very promising growth story, one that is rooted in providing great value and service to hard-working Canadians and one that, no doubt in my mind, will reward shareholders in the years to come

There are so many people to thank: Our Board of Directors, my colleagues on the executive team, and the talented and deeply committed finance team that I've had the privilege of leading. But above all, a special shout-out to the thousands of Shaw employees across the country. The work that you do day in and day out will continue to be the foundation of the organization's success. Your attention and care for our customers, for our work and for each other does not go unnoticed

Thanks, Brad, and back to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [4]

Thank you, Vito, for the significant contribution to our business. It's been an absolute pleasure to work alongside you for the last 3 years. You've led a talented finance team and transformed our financial management approach to partnering with the business. On behalf of everyone at Shaw, we wish you only the best going forward

Today, as we look to the future at Shaw, we have made the strategic choices that will define our future. We are executing a step-by-step wireless roadmap that we delivered in the quarter and continue to deliver in the market to date. Our focus on customer experience, truck rolls and our network in the Consumer business provides us with significant upside as well. And on business, we will continue to disrupt with our products -- product suite and opportunities to move upmarket. All of our business units will always put the customer at the center

Taken together, Shaw is well positioned for growth in revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow

Finally, before we turn the call over, we'd like to take this opportunity to send our love to the players, families and communities close to the sad events that hit Humboldt, Saskatchewan this week. So many of our employees, our shareholders and our customers have joined together with other Canadians to support those impacted by this tragic event. And this morning around our offices and across this country, thousands of our employees were participating in the Jersey Day campaign to recognize the support for the Humboldt Broncos family

Thank you, operator. We'll turn it back over to questions

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Shaw Communications' Third Quarter Fiscal 2018 Conference Call and Webcast. Today's call will be hosted by Mr. Brad Shaw, CEO of Shaw Communications. (Operator Instructions)
 Before we begin, management would like to remind listeners that comments made during today's call will include forward-looking information, and there are risks that actual results could differ materially. Please refer to the company's publicly filed documents for more details on assumptions and risks

Mr. Shaw, I will now turn the call over to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [2]

Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. With me today are members of our senior management team, including Jay, Trevor and Paul

This morning, we released our third quarter fiscal 2018 operating and financial results, which demonstrate continued momentum in our Wireless business as we added over 54,000 postpaid subscribers in the quarter. Notably, we also grew blended ARPU by almost 8% compared to a year ago as Freedom customers continue to recognize the value of our Big Gig data plan and significant network enhancements

We continue to improve the Wireless experience for our customers, whether it's through an improved network our spectrum is deployed, innovative data plans, the latest smartphone devices or more distribution points of presence to expand our reach in customer awareness. Today, we are pleased to announce another national retail partner, Walmart, that will result in additional 140 locations throughout Ontario, Alberta and B.C. carrying our products and services. The combination of Walmart along with Loblaws, that we announced last quarter, and our existing corporate stores and third-party dealers results in approximately 600 total distribution locations that will be operational by early 2019. This represents a material improvement in our reach compared to our footprint at the time of the WIND acquisition

In May, we completed some initial 5G technical trials, and it's clear that this new technology will transform the industry through faster wireless speeds that will enable future technologies. Both wireline infrastructure and spectrum allocation will play a critical role in 5G deployment. Our hybrid fiber coax network has extensive fiber assets to support 5G as well as next-generation DOCSIS infrastructure, which will be capable of multigigabit speeds required for 5G services

In addition, as we build our small-cell network, we have the advantage of approximately 100,000 Shaw Go WiFi access points. Recent announcements from the government further support deployment of 5G by providing a view into the spectrum road map and auction timing as we look forward to participating throughout the consultation process

In our Wireline business, we committed to being more focused on profitability, profitable subscriber growth, and I believe we have a compelling product lineup and value proposition with a clear road map that offers innovation and exceptional customer service through our digital transformation that supports this focus

There are a number of items that impacted our results this quarter, particularly internet, including seasonal student disconnect activity that typically reverses in Q1, a shift in some bulk accounts from Consumer to Business and continued market dynamics, including attractive promotions by the competition and our pricing discipline, all of which contributed to a lower sales activity in Q3

Even after considering these factors, we're not pleased with the overall execution within our Wireline business. Over recent years, the investments in our infrastructure has our network in fantastic shape, and we have never been more excited about our product road map now and in the future. However, we need to be more effective in the way we price and package our services and improve our ability to target customers with more effective offers through better segmentation and spending our promotional dollars with a data-driven approach. This focus will significantly enhance the way in which we interact with customers and improve results going forward

Over the last several months, our management team is focused on the transition through the Voluntary Departure Program and have also designed and implemented a new comprehensive organizational structure. This optimized structure will hold our business leaders accountable for driving results and executing better than ever before

Our focus has not changed. I firmly believe that we have significant growth opportunities ahead, which includes Wireless, Business and broadband as the primary drivers for Shaw. And specifically within our Consumer business, we will continue to optimize our pricing and packaging and introduce innovative products and services underpinned by our partnership with Comcast and our strong network

I will now turn the call over to Trevor to review the Q3 financial 2018 results

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [3]

Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. In Q3, we delivered revenue of $1.3 billion, which represents approximately 7% year-over-year growth, led by strong Wireless performance. Consolidated EBITDA of $547 million also increased 7%, primarily due to improvements in Wireless and lower Wireline expenses through cost efficiencies as we began our transition through the Voluntary Departure Program exits that started at the end of March

In the quarter, total Wireless revenue increased 54% to $237 million. Revenue growth is primarily due to the increase in our subscriber base, equipment sales and the ongoing success of our Big Gig data plans that helped drive a 7.5% increase in blended ARPU to $39.84 compared to a year ago

The combination of strong ARPU growth and over 200,000 additional wireless customers over the last 12 months drove service revenue up 27%. Q3 Wireless EBITDA of $62 million increased 48% over the same period in fiscal 2017. However, the results this quarter do include a onetime recovery of approximately $13 million related to the retroactive roaming rate decision, which was previously discussed and disclosed in our Q2 results

In Wireline, year-over-year Consumer revenue was essentially flat at $923 million, while Business revenue increased 6% to $141 million. Wireline EBITDA of $485 million, which includes $60 million in VD -- VDP-related cost reductions in the quarter increased 3.4% compared to Q3 fiscal '17. Capital this quarter of -- the capital spending this quarter of $293 million was roughly the same compared to the prior year with declines in Wireline offset by increased spending in our Wireless segment

While overall spending in Q3 was below consensus, we do expect capital investments to increase in Q4 as we continue to invest in both our Wireline and Wireless infrastructure. This includes 700 deployment, which is really beginning to -- which is just beginning to accelerate, and continued foundational investments and alignments with the Comcast road map for IPTV, which includes capital related to cloud DVR capabilities. We continue to expect overall CapEx will be in line with our fiscal 2008 (sic) [2018] guidance

As it relates to our Total Business Transformation, the third quarter includes an additional restructuring charge of $13 million, bringing the total provision to $430 million, of which $110 million has been paid to-date as of the end of the quarter. As employees were given the option of deferring payments over 2 calendar years for tax purposes, the actual timing of employee-related payments now extends to a 32-month period compared to actual exits, which are still predominantly in our original 18 to 24 month timing

Approximately 850 employees have departed the company between March 29 and May 31, resulting in total savings of $19 million in operating and capital cost in the quarter. The program remains on track to deliver fiscal 2018 operating savings of approximately $40 million as a result of the departure of approximately 1,200 employees by August 31

Besides the additional restructuring charge this quarter, we also incurred a $284 million impairment related to our investment in Corus. As you know, we account for this investment using the equity method, whereby the carrying value was recorded at the time of the transaction on April 1, 2016, and report our share of Corus net income and dividends each quarter

Like other investments, we evaluate the carrying value of each on a quarterly basis. And in Q3, we considered a number of recent developments with respect to Corus. Our updated carrying value reflects an impairment in the amount of $284 million, and this write-down was the main driver of reported net loss for the quarter of $91 million

As fiscal 2018 concludes, we expect continued positive momentum in Wireless, particularly during the back-to-school period, along with Wireline growth that includes recent rate adjustments that became effective June 1 and continued cost discipline throughout the organization

Considering year-to-date results and our Q4 plan, we also confirmed this morning that we remain on track to meet F '18 guidance, whereby we expect consolidated operating income before restructuring costs and amortization to grow to approximately $2.1 billion, a year-over-year projected increase of approximately 5%, capital investments of approximately $1.38 billion and free cash flow of approximately $375 million

As a reminder, our guidance includes certain assumptions related to cost reductions that will be achieved through TBT initiatives, specifically the VDP, roaming cost reductions of $13 million that was realized in the quarter, and short-term incremental costs associated with the growth in Wireless handset sales

Brad, with that, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [4]

Great. Thank you, Trevor. As I've said on previous calls, we have a lot to be excited about. The opportunities are right in front of us, and the entire team is focused on execution. We'll be finalizing our fiscal '19 plans over the coming months, and we look forward to speaking to everyone in October, where we'll be providing additional details regarding our strategic and operating focus for 2019

Thank you, everyone, and we'll turn it back to you, operator, for questions

Operator   [1]

Welcome to the Shaw Communications Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Conference Call and Webcast. Today's call will be hosted by Mr. Bradshaw, CEO of Shaw Communications. (Operator Instructions) The conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)
 Before we begin, management would like to remind listeners that comments made during today's call will include forward-looking information and there are risks that actual results could differ materially. Please refer to the company's publicly filed documents for more details on assumptions and risks

Mr. Shaw, I will now turn the conference over to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [2]

Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. With me today are members of our senior management team, including Jay, Trevor and Paul

I am pleased with the progress we have made throughout 2018 towards our overarching goal of delivering long-term and sustainable growth. Wireless had an exceptional year, with all of our key performance metrics moving in the right direction, including postpaid additions of 85,000 customers in Q4. In 2018, we grew our subscriber base by over 255,000, or 22% compared to F '17, to end the year at just over 1.4 million customers

Our big data plans, combined with our latest devices available in the market, continue to drive higher quality and higher lifetime value customers to Freedom Mobile. Our wireless service is now even more accessible to Canadians through the addition of 240 locations launched with our national retail partners, Loblaws and Walmart

As we grow our subscriber base in F '18, we also increased ARPU, particularly in the last half of the year as our Big Gig plan gained momentum, leading to strong ARPU growth of 9% in Q4. Through these results, it is evident that we are delivering a differentiated and sustainable value proposition, and we expect to gain additional wireless market share and continue to grow ARPU throughout F '19. Supporting our wireless strategy is the significant ongoing network improvements that are quickly creating a strong, high-quality network and clearly benefiting our customers. The team has done a terrific job of managing and deploying spectrum in the most efficient way, including the initial launch of our extended-range LTE in Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver and Southern Ontario

The extended-range LTE utilizes the 700 spectrum that we acquired last year, and we will further deploy this spectrum throughout our network over the course of F '19. We also launched VoLTE over a wide range of devices, and we'll continue to roll this out to all eligible phones and customers over the coming months, including the iPhone, bringing the total customer base to approximately 800,000 that will be using VoLTE by the end of 2018

Wireless investments remain a priority as we head into F '19 and continue to grow our subscriber base. In addition to the spectrum deployment, we will also expand our wireless network into new markets this year, with a focus on Western Canada. By the end of fiscal '19, our network will cover an additional population of approximately 1.3 million, and we will start to explore cross-selling opportunities with Freedom Mobile and Shaw wireline customers, using our various touch points to discuss their wireless products and needs

While we are excited to develop this opportunity, we will focus this year on learning from small-scale trials and taking a thoughtful end-to-end approach

In our Wireline business, we delivered F '18 results that are consistent with our strategy to focus on profitable growth and stabilize results, and I'm pleased with the significant cost savings that we have achieved during the year. However, I believe we can execute better, particularly with the Internet results for the last 2 quarters have not been representative of the subscriber opportunity through our differentiated broadband experience

Significant investments and best-in-class technology partners have created a strong and ubiquitous wireline network. DOCSIS 3.1 has been clearly deployed throughout our network, and we are capable of delivering gigabyte Internet speeds

As we anchor the home with the XB6 modems, we will enable additional IP services such as xFi and the extenders that will differentiate our broadband service from the competition

In F '19, we will begin deploying a full IPTV experience to our customers, starting in the second half of the year. With this service, we will simplify the installation process, reduce the amount of equipment needed in the home and enhance the ability for customers to self-install. All these initiatives lead to a lower capital intensity in our Wireline business that we believe is sustainable going forward. And our Wireline capital provide -- plan provides the necessary resources to make investments to future-proof our network in the coming years

Our Business division contributed solid results in F '18, via the growth of our smart products and recent success in the enterprise and wholesale markets. We expect this momentum to continue as we focus on delivering our managed services and targeted strategic verticals

As I stated earlier, I'm pleased with our fiscal 2018 results, and looking forward, we are focused on the key areas of our business that will drive growth as well as areas that need improvement. We expect that in F '19, our wireless momentum will continue as we execute on our step-by-step operating initiatives

In Wireline, we will have an internal focus that enables us to transition into a digital-first company and modernize how we work and connect with our customers

Now, I'll turn the call over to Trevor to go through the Q4 and F '18 results and review our fiscal 2019 guidance in more detail. Trevor?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [3]

Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. We finished fiscal 2018 on a strong note from a financial perspective, with all business units contributing to Q4 consolidated revenue growth of 7.4% to $1.3 billion and EBITDA growth of almost 17% to $560 million compared to the prior year

Q4 Wireless revenue grew 45% year-over-year, to $250 million. On a run rate basis, this represents a Wireless business generating $1 billion in revenue, a significant achievement considering our starting point 2.5 years ago since we -- since the acquisition of WIND closed. Strong Wireless service revenue growth of 32% to $167 million in Q4 was driven by ARPU increasing by 9% to $41, compared to a year ago. For the year, Wireless revenue and EBITDA increased 57% and 32% to $951 million and $176 million, respectively, as we continue to attract and retain customers with our data-centered plans and continuous improving network

In Wireline, Q4 Consumer revenue was essentially flat at $942 million compared to the prior year, while Business revenue increased over 6%, to $145 million. Consolidated Wireline EBITDA growth of 16%, to $516 million, was a significant improvement compared to Q4 fiscal '17 and includes approximately $23 million in VDP-related cost reductions as well as lower marketing and other corporate costs. These results reflect our focus and discipline regarding expenditures throughout the entire organization. For the full year, Wireline revenue was essentially flat, as the marginal decline in Consumer revenue was offset by Business growth. However, year-over-year Wireline EBITDA did increase 2.6% during the year, to $1.9 billion

As it relates to our total business transformation initiatives, the fourth quarter includes an additional restructuring charge of $16 million, bringing the total provision to $446 million, of which approximately $170 million has been paid to date

While the employee exits will continue throughout F '19 and into F '20, the restructuring program is substantially done. And in fiscal 2018, we realized combined operating capital savings of $47 million, which was as expected and communicated earlier this year

In summary, our fiscal 2018 results were largely in line with our expectations and reflect our focus on Wireless growth and profitability and stable financial results within our Wireline business

Consolidated EBITDA growth of 4.6% and capital spending of approximately $1.37 billion materially met our guidance, while we delivered free cash flow of $411 million that was slightly ahead of expectations

As we carry this momentum into next year, we're introducing our fiscal 2019 guidance, which includes EBITDA growth to range between 4% to 6% versus F '18, capital spending of approximately $1.2 billion and free cash flow in excess of $500 million. Our guidance in growth range includes the expected impact of IFRS 15, which we'll adopt on a retrospective basis beginning in Q1 F '19. The fiscal 2018 and expected fiscal 2019 results under IFRS do not have any material impact on the guidance we released this morning. However, for the benefit of the investors comparing our F '18 reported results and adjusting for the change in accounting policy, our reported 2018 Wireless revenue will decrease under IFRS due to the fact that we'll be allocating a portion of the subsidy to service revenue, which is amortized over the term of the contract, and we'll also be allocating a portion of the subsidy against equipment revenue, which has an impact at the time of sale, as opposed to today, where we actually amortize the entire subsidy over the term of the contract against only equipment revenue

The decrease in Wireless revenue will flow through to EBITDA. However, we do gain the benefit of capitalizing and amortizing the commission expense related to Wireless sales under IFRS 15, versus today, where we expense commissions on the date of sale. Despite the changes in accounting, it's important to remind everyone that there's no change to overall revenue and cash -- cash flow under the new accounting policy. We will provide additional details with respect to the impact of IFRS on 2018 reported results when we file our 2018 annual in November and with the release of our first quarter results in January

Our guidance includes assumptions related to cost reductions that we'll achieve through TVt initiatives, specifically the Voluntary Departure Program. Total savings are expected to amount to $140 million of OpEx and CapEx in fiscal 2019

As Brad discussed in his earlier remarks, we have a strong wireline network that has the capacity to meet the increasing demands of our customers, combined with lower equipment requirements and higher self-install, we can moderate our wireline capital intensity. However, we will increase investments in Wireless compared to F '18 as we continue to deploy the 700 spectrum and expand our network into new communities, as Brad mentioned. We expect Wireless CapEx to be approximately $400 million in F '19, or up approximately 15% versus F '18

Considering our EBITDA and capital expenditure guidance, we expect to drive material free cash flow in F '19 in excess of $500 million. Note, we will continue to include the Corus dividend in our free cash flow metric, which is expected to be approximately $20 million in F '19 versus the $92 million that we received in F '18. However, it's clear that we are growing our operating free cash flow in fiscal '19 regardless of the treatment of Corus' dividend contribution. Our balance sheet remains strong, and our leverage of approximately 2x is at the low end of our target range, providing us additional flexibility as we continue to make the appropriate investments to grow our business

Brad, I'll now turn the call back over to you for closing remarks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [4]

Thank you, Trevor. We have a strong operating plan in place and expect to deliver continued Wireless growth and stable, consistent Wireline results. This is the year that we turn a very significant corner in terms of our free cash flow profile for F '19 and beyond, and our focus remains on successfully executing our strategy. Recently, there's been speculation regarding our investment in Corus, and we want to clarify that we remain supportive of Corus and their management team. While it remains a challenging structural environment, we think their stock is undervalued and not reflective of the EBITDA and free cash flow profile of the company

We will not look to sell our stake at this current levels, and we do not need additional liquidity from Corus to fund any of our operating or strategic initiatives, now or in the future

Before we turn over to questions, I wanted to acknowledge the tremendous dedication and hard work by all of the Shaw employees over the last year. We have been through a lot of change, which is exciting but not always easy. It is through your passion to continuously improve and collaborate across the organization that drives great results. Thank you for everything that you do, and I look forward to an exciting and successful year ahead. Thank you, everyone, and we'll turn it back to you, operator, for questions

Thank you, operator. Good morning, and happy New Year to everyone. With me today are members of our senior management team, including Jay, Trevor and Paul

This morning, we released our first quarter operating and financial results for fiscal 2019, and we are pleased with the performance of all our divisions. The results reflect the team's collective effort and commitment to stabilizing our wireline business and capitalizing on the growth opportunities within our Wireless operations

As we discussed last quarter, our entire organization is focused on improving execution and delivering our F '19 operating plans while making appropriate strategic investments that will yield significant benefits for all of our stakeholders going forward. Our Wireless division continues to thrive as we added over 86,000 postpaid customers in the quarter and delivered significant revenue and EBITDA growth

The success we are achieving in postpaid customer growth is a direct result of our strategy to enhance the network experience and reposition Freedom Mobile as a strong and differentiated competitor in the Canadian wireless landscape. Our efforts and focus over the quarter were aligned with our strategy as we continued to move upmarket in that higher value customers

Since our entry into wireless, we have invested capital and resources to improve both the reality and perception that Freedom's network was inferior. Today we disclosed postpaid churn results that importantly show what our customers think of the Freedom exercise -- Freedom experience, oops, sorry, about that

Postpaid churn of 1.28% improved significantly by 36 basis points over the last year. We have deployed spectrum, introduced innovative data-centric plans, expanded our handset lineup with the latest and most popular devices and significantly added to our retail distribution. These investments are all supportive of an improved customer experience, leading to better churn and average billing per user growth, which is up 12% in the quarter

In readiness for Black Friday and the critical holiday selling season, we launched our innovative Big Binge Bonus program in late October, which provided new Freedom customers up to an additional 100 gigs of data to use at their discretion. This strategy helped Freedom continue to attract high-value postpaid customers. Overall, our sales activity remained strong throughout the holidays, however, I would characterize that the overall wireless environment as being less active than a year ago

From a network perspective, our priority continues to be the roll of the 700 megahertz spectrum, which includes our initial launch in all of our major markets in Q1. As at the end of November, the 700 rollout was approximately 25% complete, and we will continue to deploy this spectrum across our footprint over F '19. We have also made VoLTE available to approximately 35 different devices, representing over 800,000 phones on our Freedom network

Considering the recent events and securities concerns around Huawei, we want to confirm that our wireless network does not contain any Huawei equipment. We have partnered with Nokia on our wireless technology supplier, and we'll continue to build and expand our network to be compatible with future technologies, such as 5G

We are pleased to report that we launched the remaining national retail stores in all 140 Walmart locations. Combined with our corporate and dealer network, we now have over 600 locations selling Freedom services. We will continue to expand our corporate and dealer store footprint throughout fiscal 2019 as we launch in new Western markets, including Victoria and Red Deer, which are expected to be operational next month

In our wireline business, we have made some important steps in the right direction as we added Internet subscribers this quarter, double the speeds of our top Internet tiers and stabilized revenue through a renewed approach to base management, which includes a balanced and digital focus on acquisition and retention

We delivered a 46% wireline margin in the quarter, up significantly from Q1 last year as we focused on optimizing our consumer business, including deploying resources that are aligned with our profitability focus, removing cost where possible and leveraging our network and strategic partnership advantages

Our recent speed increases implemented in December, which included taking Internet 150 and 300 customers to Internet 300 and 600, respectively, impacted approximately half of our Internet base. These customers received an improved Internet experience, showcasing the strength of our network, which supports long-term pricing power of our broadband service

While we're still early days regarding our journey towards a modern Shaw, I am encouraged by the progress we have made as we improve upon the fundamentals of our business and focus on delivering an exciting broadband road map in fiscal 2019 that includes anchoring the home with the XB6 modems, introducing a superior managed WiFi experience with xFi and home extenders, followed by the availability of IPTV, including cloud DVR, for our customers later in the year

Now I'll turn it over to Trevor to go through the Q1 results in a bit more detail

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [3]

Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal '19 is off to a great start with positive financial contributions from all business divisions. And before getting into the numbers, I do want to confirm that all reported and comparative figures reflect the accounting policy changes related to IFRS 15, which of course primarily impacts our Wireless division

On a consolidation basis, revenue grew 8.8% to $1.36 billion, and EBITDA increased 13.5% to $545 million compared to the prior year. From a divisional perspective and on Wireless, supported by strong subscriber growth over the last year, including our first quarter additions, consolidated Wireless revenue increased 60% year-over-year to $273 million. This includes service revenue growth of over 30% in Q1, which was driven by ABPU growth of 12% to almost $42

Wireless EBITDA grew over 36% to $45 million this quarter. As a reminder, the change in accounting under IFRS 15 is primarily related to our treatment of Wireless subsidies. In the past, we would amortize the subsidy over the life of the contract against equipment revenue only. We now allocate the subsidy proportionately between equipment revenue, which is expensed in the period, and service revenue, which is amortized over the contract period

The net result in the near term is a decrease in revenue and EBITDA, although EBITDA to a lesser extent as we now amortize commissions over the contract period compared to pre-IFRS accounting where we expensed them on day 1. While accounting changes created some noise in the results and from a comparative perspective, it's important to remind investors there's no actual change in overall revenue or cash flow from the customer

You can see from our disclosure that the impact of IFRS on Q1 F '18 results was immaterial, reducing Wireless revenue by $4 million and EBITDA by approximately $1 million. As you would expect, the impact is more meaningful through Q2 and Q3, when last year, we significantly increased device sales and corresponding subsidies related to customer growth. As disclosed in our annual report, the full year impact in F '18 due to the accounting policy change was a reduction of approximately $50 million in wireless revenue and approximately $30 million in wireless EBITDA

In wireline, Q1 consumer revenue was essentially flat at $936 million compared to the prior year, while business revenue increased 5%. Wireline EBITDA growth of 12% to $500 million, includes approximately $25 million in VDP-related cost reductions

First quarter wireline margin of 46% represents a 460 basis points improvement compared to a year ago and includes savings related to VDP, lower marketing expenses and our overall focus on profitability. In the quarter, we did incur a retroactive cost of approximately $7 million related to higher rates than expected from the Copyright Board of Canada for retransmission tariffs covering the 2014 to '18 period. However, we also have a number of smaller favorable onetime adjustments and provision releases that essentially offset this retroactive tariff charge this quarter

In the quarter, our reinvestments to enable VDP were slightly behind our internal plan with more spend shifting into Q2 and throughout F '19. However, overall, we remain on track to deliver $140 million of VDP combined net operating and capital savings this year

Capital spending of $271 million in the quarter was largely on plan with reductions in wireline expenditures, our network infrastructure and customer prem equipment. Wireless investments in the quarter include deployment of the 700 spectrum, which will continue to ramp over the coming quarters

Our Q4 F '18 spend included delivery of wireless equipment, whereby, there is a timing difference between delivery and deployment and, therefore, Q1 F '19 wireless capital was below Street expectations. However, in aggregate, we continue to expect F '19 Wireless investments to be approximately $400 million. With Q1 behind us, we remain on track with respect to our F '19 guidance of consolidated EBITDA growth of 4% to 6%, capital investments of approximately $1.2 billion and free cash flow in excess of $500 million

Before turning the call back to Brad for closing remarks, I wanted to briefly discuss our recent capital markets activity. Our balance sheet continues to be strong with leverage remaining at approximately 2x. And in November, we accessed the debt capital markets and were successful in raising $1 billion in senior notes at attractive rates and tenors. Considering market volatility, we viewed this as a prudent proactive approach regarding our $1.25 billion maturity that is due in October 2019

Brad, back to you

 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [4]

Thank you, Trevor. I'm pleased with our quarter -- first quarter results and the progress that we have made. Our focus in fiscal 2019 is on execution, while we managed through a significant period of change. During the year, we're making investments required to enable VDP exits and transition to a digital-first organization. We will launch new IP products that focus on growing our broadband business, and we will continue with our network and retail expansion, supporting further Wireless growth. I'm confident in our ability to deliver on all these key strategic initiatives and look forward to providing updates throughout the year. Thank you

And we'll now turn it back to the operator for questions

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Shaw Communications Second Quarter 2019 Conference Call and Webcast. Today's call will be hosted by Mr. Brad Shaw, CEO of Shaw Communications. (Operator Instructions) And the conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)
 Before we begin, management would like to remind listeners that comments made during today's call will include forward-looking information, and there are risks that actual results could differ materially. Please refer to the company's publicly filed documents for more details on assumptions and risks

Mr. Shaw, I will now turn the call over to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [2]

Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. With me today are members of our senior management team, including Jay, Trevor and Paul. Earlier this morning, we released our second quarter results for fiscal 2019, which reflect strong financial performance both in the quarter and year-to-date. We continue to make progress on our strategic priorities and our journey to a modern Shaw, and we are excited about a number of recently announced initiatives

We delivered growth in our wireless business with postpaid subscriber additions of approximately 65,000 in the quarter. While the subscriber results reflected less active period compared to a year ago, we have grown postpaid subscribers by almost 20% on a year-to-date basis compared to fiscal '18, which, as everyone will recall, included record Q2 net additions last year partly due to our initial launch of the iPhone

Wireless ABPU increased 7.5% as we continuing to attract customers to Big Gig data plans, partially offset this quarter with additional promotions to compensate for lower market activity as well as higher retention spending by our competitors. As we enhance our customer experience through the rollout of the 700 megahertz spectrum, more and more customers are staying with Freedom as postpaid churn improved 30 basis points to 1.36% in the quarter

As previously communicated, we are expanding our wireless network in 2019 with the launch of Victoria and Red Deer on February, followed by 6 communities in Eastern Ontario in early March. We are encouraged by the early results and are excited to launch additional markets throughout the remainder of the year

Over the past few days, we have introduced some new advertising that continues to call wireless customer pain points in a direct manner. We are proud of our wireless network, the improvements we have made in our innovative and data-centric offers

Canadians need to know that only a wireless device with an abundant data plan doesn't need to be unaffordable or complicated. We have also introduced new prepaid wireless plans, and I'm pleased to announce that we have finalized an agreement with our third national retail distributor, Mobilinq, who will carry Freedom prepaid offers in all 50 of their locations that will start to roll out later this month

This segment of the market has become increasingly competitive over the last several months. While our priority remains to target and attract higher-value postpaid customers, we can also participate more effectively in the growth of the prepaid market with an attractive offers, including LTE data

In our wireline business, we delivered improved broadband results over the previous year and previous quarter. The Consumer team is embracing our agile digital-first model, and we are making incremental changes that are driving results

In Q2, ValuePlan penetration of our new Internet customers was one of the strongest on record, leveraging our fast-for-all campaign that doubled the speeds of our top Internet tiers in late November. We continue to make positive strides with self-install, which is up to 37% of total activity in the quarter. More than ever, it is simple and easy to choose the right Internet plan, order it online, have the equipment delivered and self-provision the services in just a matter of minutes

On April 4, we launched Shaw BlueCurve, a fresh, new brand campaign that captures this momentum and showcases our technology and transformation to a broadband first all IP company. BlueCurve is a simple and powerful new technology that, besides just speed, gives customers more coverage and greater control over their in-home Wi-Fi experience, while also helping to redefine the relationship with in-home connected devices

Our BlueCurve Gateway Home app and Pods are the latest innovative in-home Consumer products that we have brought to the market through our Comcast partnership, and enables us to differentiate our Internet service and technology from the competition

Just as residential customers are benefiting from the network investments, so too are Shaw Business customers with speed increases to our top tiers and additional new services, including the launch of gigabyte Internet (sic) [gigabit Internet] in early March. Our year-to-date performance has been strong, and we are delivering on our operating plan and executing better. We still have hard work ahead of us and we are only halfway through the VDP exits. But we have exciting new products, brand and advertising campaigns. And the teams are engaged and motivated to deliver results

Now I'll turn it over to Trevor to go through the Q2 results in a bit more detail. Trevor?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [3]

Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results have contributed to a strong first half for fiscal 2019

On a consolidated basis, Q2 revenue of $1.32 billion declined marginally year-over-year largely due to lower wireless equipment revenue as the prior year's quarter included a record subscriber performance

However, consolidated EBITDA grew by almost 14% with strong contribution from both our wireline and wireless segments

In our wireless business, we delivered a 26% increase in service revenue to almost $170 million in the quarter as we continue to grow our postpaid customer base, including those who subscribe to our Big Gig data plans. However, equipment revenue of $78 million did decline by 40% due to lower sub loading compared to the previous year

Blended ABPU in the quarter was up 7.5% from a year ago but did include additional promotions to compensate for the lower activity and the competitive dynamics in the wireless market

Wireless EBITDA of $52 million in the quarter increased by almost 190% year-over-year reflecting continued subscriber growth, higher ABPU and ARPU, but also the large impact that IFRS 15 had on our Q2 F '18 results

In wireline, Q2 Consumer revenue was essentially flat at $923 million compared to the prior year. While business revenue increased almost 6%. Wireline EBITDA growth of 7% to $479 million includes approximately $27 million in VDP-related cost reductions

Second quarter wireline margin of 46% represents a 280 basis point improvement compared to a year ago and does include VDP savings, lower marketing expenses and our overall focus on profitability. We also had onetime favorable accounting adjustments of approximately $5 million in the quarter

Reinvestments in tools and automation related to our VDP enablement did commence in the quarter, but we continue to expect these investments to accelerate in Q3 and Q4. The shift in timing to the second half of F '19 is largely driven by our product road map. However, regardless of timing, we remain firmly on track to deliver $140 million of combined operating and capital cost savings this year related to VDP

Capital expenditures of almost $280 million in the quarter was in line with last year with continued reductions in wireline, offset by increased wireless spending, largely related to the deployment of the 700 spectrum and expansion of our network and retail locations into new cities and communities

We're at the halfway point of the year, and although we have delivered strong EBITDA performance in the 6 month -- first 6 months of F '19, we do not expect these growth rates to carry through to the back half of the year due to tougher comparables as VDP savings did commence in March 2018. The expectation of digital VDP reinvestments in Q3 and Q4 as well as higher marketing spend in the second half to support the launch of Shaw BlueCurve and our new wireless campaign

Considering all of these factors, we are confirming that we remain on track to deliver F '19 EBITDA guidance of 4% to 6%, capital investments of approximately $1.2 billion and free cash flow in excess of $500 million. However, considering our performance to date and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we would be disappointed if we do not achieve the top end of our EBITDA guidance range

Brad, back to you for closing remarks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [4]

Thank you, Trevor. Let me close by saying that this is such an exciting time for Shaw. We are making progress on several initiatives, including a significant step forward with our IP broadband strategy, supported by a new look and feel with respect to the launch of our Shaw BlueCurve branding initiatives. We will continue to inform Canadians about our innovative and affordable wireless offers, expansion of the network into new communities and our refreshed prepaid offers that enable us to more effectively target that segment of the market. A big, big thank you to all of our teams at Shaw and Freedom that are driving change and delivering results

Thank you. We'll now turn it back to the operator for questions

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Shaw Communications Third Quarter 2019 Conference Call and Webcast. Today's call will be hosted by Mr. Brad Shaw, CEO of Shaw Communications. (Operator Instructions)
 Before we begin, management would like to remind listeners that comments made during today's call will include forward-looking information, and there are risks that actual results could differ materially.

Mr. Shaw, I would now like to turn the call over to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [2]

Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. With me today are members of our senior management team, including Jay Mehr, Trevor English and Paul McAleese

Earlier this morning, we released our third quarter operating and financial results for fiscal 2019, reflecting our continued focus on wireline execution and strong growth in our wireless business. While the quarter included a $15 million payment related to IP matters that impacted the reported results, the underlying performance of our business remains solid and Trevor will walk us through this in more detail

In wireless, we had another terrific quarter with a total net additions of approximately 62,000 compared to 47,000 a year ago. Included in the result is a 61,000 postpaid subscriber additions and record low postpaid churn of 1.18%. Clearly, our strategy to grow this customer segment through an improved network experience, the latest devices and affordable data-centric plans is delivering great results

We also added approximately 800 prepaid customers in the quarter, a significant change in trajectory from the recent quarters, due to the success of our new plans launched on April 4. 18 months ago, Freedom Mobile permanently changed the Canadian wireless industry with our Big Gig data plans, which feature large buckets of fast LTE data and no overage charges

In recent weeks, each of the incumbents was finally forced to respond to our success by launching their own more expensive versions of our Big Gig plans. It's now absolutely clear that Canadian wireless prices are coming down and that Freedom Mobile is the catalyst for this change

For the big 3, these new rate plans offer a dramatic about-face from the expensive data overages that their customers have been paying for years. It's just too bad they haven't gone far enough. If you are a customer of one of the incumbents, chances are you are still struggling with your current data plan and its toxic overage fees. Meanwhile, all Freedom Mobile postpaid customers can use their phones and devices with no limits, just as they always have been able to

We have worked hard to reset Canadians expectations of their wireless providers and the competition is learning to follow our lead. And while their recent pricing moves have attracted lot of attention, they have yet to have any meaningful impact on our customer acquisition initiatives, and we remain confident that the value of our Big Gig plans continue to resonate with Canadians

In our wireline business, we added approximately 7,000 broadband customers. This is a significant improvement from a year ago in a seasonally challenged quarter due to student disconnects that happened in May

Our year-to-date broadband net additions reflect a more consistent and improving trend compared to the previous year and is a direct result of our focus on execution. While it is still early days with our BlueCurve platform, we are pleased with its progress, which has met all of our targets. And it's the technology that lends itself well to our digital strategy, including a robust self-install experience. During the quarter, self-install increased again to 41% of total consumer activity, and we expect this improving trend to continue

We also recently launched IPTV in Calgary and expect to roll this service to additional key markets over the next several months. The main benefits related to the introduction of IPTV include lower success base capital as well as a lower service delivery cost as video becomes much easier to self-install. As we launch IPTV in additional markets, our overall video strategy has not changed and remains focused on profitability

During the quarter, we closed 2 significant transactions that align with our overall connectivity strategy. The acquisition of the 600 megahertz spectrum across our entire wireless footprint was critical for us and will significantly improve our LTE network and enable us to participate in the 5G landscape as it unfolds

We also completed the sale of our 39% equity stake in Corus on May 31. The sale of the Corus investment is consistent with our strategy that we embarked on over 3 years ago. This included the divestiture of our media and data center assets and a pivot into wireless. Since that time, we have made significant investments in the wireless network, which have materially improved Freedom's quality and customer experience. We continue to believe we have tremendous growth opportunities ahead as we start to bring wireless and wireline together in F '20

Now, I will turn the call over to Trevor to go through the Q3 results in more detail

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [3]

Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results that we released this morning include some items that impacted our reported figures and do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our business. On a consolidated basis, Q3 revenue of $1.3 billion increased 2.7% driven by continued growth in our wireless and business divisions. Reported EBITDA decreased 1.5% to $530 million. However, this quarter included a $15 million payment to address certain matters with a large IP licensing company. The comparable period of Q3 F '18 to be more specific also included a CRTC retroactive roaming benefit of approximately $13 million. Excluding both, the underlying EBITDA performance in the quarter was up almost 4% to $545 million

In our wireless business, which delivered another solid quarter of subscriber and financial growth, servicing revenue increased 22% to $178 million, as we continue to grow our subbase and ABPU. Wireless equipment revenue declined by approximately 9% year-over-year to $73 million, as a larger portion of subscribers in the quarter were BYOD. Our churn metrics continued to improve and our mix of prepaid and postpaid customers is more balanced, consistent with what we disclosed on the last conference call

Wireless EBITDA was $55 million in the quarter, an increase of 38% when adjusting for the $13 million roaming benefit in Q3 F '18. In wireline, Q3 consumer revenue was essentially flat at $925 million compared to the prior year, while business revenue of $150 million increased over 6%. Reported wireline EBITDA of $530 million declined 1.5% year-over-year. However, when considering the $15 million IP licensing payment, EBITDA actually grew 1% and our wireline margin was in line with previous quarters

Capital expenditures of $280 million in the quarter was approximately 9% lower than last year with continued reductions in wireline partially offset by increased wireless spending. We expect substantial capital investment for wireless in Q4 as we continue the deployment of the 700 spectrum and launch our wireless network in 10 additional communities by the end of August. We still expect total CapEx within our wireless business to be approximately $400 million this year

In the quarter, approximately 350 employees exited as part of our VDP program. On a year-to-date basis, we have achieved $73 million in net operating cost savings and $25 million in net capital cost savings. As we expressed last quarter, the operating savings continued to run slightly ahead of schedule, while capital is a bit behind

In Q3, we reinvested approximately $5 million of operating costs in a variety of projects related to enabling our VDP program. We are still expecting to reinvest a total of $10 million to $15 million in the second half of fiscal '19 with approximately 60% of this spend reoccurring. Therefore, Q4 reinvestment will be at least the same as Q3 or likely a bit higher

As we continue to make our way through the VDP program, there have been some minor shifts compared to our original plan, and we wanted to be as transparent as possible with investors. In fiscal '19, we now expect net operating savings to be approximately $95 million and $40 million in net capital savings, for a total of $135 million, which is materially in line with our original plan of $140 million

Considering our year-to-date results, we're refining over fiscal 2019 guidance, which excludes the $15 million IP licensing payment. We expect EBITDA growth of 6%, capital investment of approximately $1.2 billion and free cash flow is expected to be approximately $550 million

As Brad mentioned earlier, we completed the acquisition of 600 megahertz spectrum for $492 million as well as the sale of Corus shares this quarter that generated approximately $525 million

Considering both transactions, we continue to have significant balance sheet flexibility and liquidity with leverage at approximately 1.8x. And we have significant cash on hand of approximately $1.4 billion to fund the remaining VDP payments, which is around $175 million over the next 12 months, and our 5.65% $1.25 billion notes that mature in October

Brad, back to you for closing remarks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [4]

Thank you, Trevor. Our year-to-date performance in fiscal 2019 is very much on plan as we continue to grow wireless and broadband. We are making smart investments in our business to streamline operations and transition to a more efficient organization

We are successfully managing through change while delivering net savings to the bottom line. As we confirm through our refined guidance, we expect a solid close to fiscal 2019 and look forward discussing our F '20 strategic priorities and targets with you in October

Thank you, and we'll now turn the call back to operator for questions

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Shaw Communications Fourth Quarter 2019 Conference Call and Webcast. Today's call will be hosted by Mr. Brad Shaw, CEO of Shaw Communications. (Operator Instructions) And the conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)
 Before we begin, management would like to remind listeners that comments made during today's call will include forward-looking information, and there are risks that actual results could differ materially.

Mr. Shaw, I will now turn the call over to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [2]

Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. With me today are members of our senior management team including Jay Mehr, Trevor English and Paul McAleese

Our strategy in 2019 was clear: we were focused on growing Wireless and Broadband customers, improving execution and delivering stable Wireline results as well as managing through a critical year in respect to VDP departures. The industry shift to unlimited plans did not impede our ability to grow our Wireless customer base. During the all-important back-to-school season, we delivered the best quarterly subscriber results in the company history with approximately 91,000 customers added in the fourth quarter. Our success in attracting and growing the subscriber base is a product of our innovation, our improving and expanding network and our effective advertising and messaging to consumers

In July, we continued to expand our service offering with the launch of the Big Gig Unlimited and Absolute Zero plans anchored around device pricing as our advantage. The results of this strategy has been positive as not only did we achieve our new subscriber record in the quarter, approximately 30% of all postpaid activations in the month of August were on a $75 or higher service plan. Due to the success in our subscriber growth, which included postpaid additions of 280,000 in the year, our Wireless business surpassed $1 billion in annual revenues in fiscal 2019. We delivered strong service revenue growth of 24% and our Wireless operating margin improved to approximately 20%, both of which supported significant EBIT growth of 45% to over $200 million

The Wireless network team has done an incredible job as we continue to strengthen and expand the network. An enhanced network experience is a key driver of the material trend reduction that Freedom delivered in F '19. We are approximately 70% complete with our 700-megahertz spectrum deployment in the Western markets and this will continue to roll out as part of our F '20 plan

In addition, we launched Freedom Mobile in 19 new communities, the majority of which happened in Q4, and we now have wireless service available to over 18 million Canadians

In Wireline, we grew Broadband subscribers throughout F '19 including over 11,000 in the fourth quarter. We exceeded our targets with respect to self-install, which was above 45% of total activations in the quarter, and launched Shaw BlueCurve, regaining our position as a technology leader

Beginning in March, we launched our IPTV service, which is now available to approximately 70% of our video footprint. This is a key transition of our legacy video platform that supports our digital transformation and lowers our cost to serve customers

Our Business division delivered another year of strong revenue growth, fueled by additional product launches including gigabyte Internet speeds and the continued success of our SmartSuite products with small and medium business customers

In F '19, Shaw Business was also successful in winning some key enterprise accounts, which is attributable to the strength of our product offerings, network and our focus on this segment

Our strong operational and financial results were accomplished whilst also managing through the significant change in our business via our digital transformation where we ended the year with approximately 70% of our VDP program complete. As a result of our focus on improving execution and delivering VDP savings, our Wireline margin improved 90 basis points to over 45% in F '19

We believe we are taking the right steps to grow and transform our business, to enhance our customer experience and improve our day-to-day operation for employees. This focus is driving significant operating capital efficiencies, and in F '19, we delivered adjusted free cash flow of $570 million. This is a remarkable [9%] increase over F '18 when removing the impact of the Corus dividends

Both the asset realignment and the internal transformation in our business over the last several years has positioned us well, and we're entering a key inflection point with respect to our free cash flow generation. This is evident in our F '20 free cash flow expectation of approximately $700 million, enabling us to implement some enhanced capital return initiatives, which I will now turn it over to Trevor to discuss along with our F '19 results and F '20 guidance

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [3]

Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. As Brad articulated, we've had a busy and successful year while making significant progress on several fronts. Full year consolidated revenue increased 3% to $5.35 billion and EBITDA of $2.16 billion grew 5% year-over-year. However, adjusting for both $15 million onetime IP licensing payment in Q3 as well as a $10 million charge related to CRTC regulatory matters in the quarter, our adjusted F '19 EBITDA increased 6.3% over F '18, which met our commitments and guidance

Growth in F '19 is driven by combination of continued strength in the Wireless business, stable Wireline results and the delivery of $135 million of total operating and capital savings under our VDP program

With lower capital requirements, particularly in our Wireline business, we delivered free cash flow of $545 million or approximately $570 million when considering the onetime impacts previously mentioned. This is a significant improvement over recent years, which saw us invest substantial capital to improve the wireless experience for our customers and to support the wireline networks to deliver faster speeds and new technologies. Our wireline network is stronger than ever with record-low congestion and is supplemented by state-of-the-art customer premise equipment that both improve the customer experience and reduces over overall cost to serve

As we enter our F '20, our strategy remains centered around Wireless, Broadband and Business as the growth drivers and a relentless focus on delivering efficiencies through a more agile operating model

We're pleased to introduce F '20 guidance including EBITDA growth that is expected to range between 11% and 12% versus F '19 reported results. Our guidance reflects the adoption of IFRS 16, which, for us, commenced on September 1. We will apply the new accounting standard on a prospective basis, and therefore, we will not be restating F '19 results. However, we estimate the impacts from IFRS 16 on fiscal '19 is approximately $155 million, of which 55% is attributable to Wireline and 45% to Wireless

Removing to the accounting impacts, EBITDA growth in F '20 is expected to range between 4% and 5%, capital investments are expected to be $1.1 billion and free cash flow is expected to approximate $700 million. Please note that both CapEx and free cash flow are not impacted by the IFRS 16 accounting policy change

Through the VDP program, we expect to deliver a total of $200 million in savings or an incremental $65 million over F '19 with the majority of the incremental savings this year arising from reduced capital expenditures. All VDP-related efficiencies are embedded within our F '20 guidance, and we remain confident in our ability to manage through the remaining departures of approximately 850 employees

We believe that F '20 marks a significant inflection point, and the strengthening free cash flow profile is concrete evidence that our asset realignment and evolution of our operating model are both yielding positive and meaningful results that are flowing to the bottom line

As we've gone through our significant transformation over the last several years, we've maintained financial strength and flexibility throughout. At the end of F '19, our leverage ratio stood at 1.9x and is the lowest among North American peers. On October 1, we repaid $1.25 billion of maturing notes through balance sheet cash, which, of course, had no impact on our leverage metrics

Considering our sound business fundamentals, strategy and focus on execution going forward, current leverage and strengthening free cash flow profile, we're pleased to announce some enhancements with respect to our capital return initiatives. Subject to TSX approvals, we will implement an NCIB program to purchase up to approximately 25 million Class B shares, which represents 5% of all issued and outstanding Class B shares. Through recent years where we made significant investments to drive our growth -- our long-term growth strategy, we maintained a healthy dividend, and we believe that an NCIB program is a flexible and efficient alternative to return additional capital to shareholders

With [F' 23] cash flow expected to be in excess of our total dividend, we also plan to satisfy our share delivery obligations under our DRIP program by purchasing Class B shares in the open market, thus, avoiding additional future equity dilution and creating synergies with the contemplated NCIB program

In addition to this change, we also announced that we're eliminating the DRIP discount, which is currently at 2%, and we expect this will lead to a significant reduction in DRIP participation

We remain committed to the long-term dividend growth and are confident in our ability to generate sustainable free cash flow. However, we believe that the enhanced capital allocation initiatives announced this morning provide us with a more balanced and flexible approach to return additional capital to shareholders

I'll now turn it back to Brad before we open the line for questions

 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [4]

Thank you, Trevor. I am very proud to say that we have built our company on the foundation of being a strong facilities-based service provider. Just earlier this week, Ookla released their latest Canadian speed test report where Shaw ranks as fastest ISP in all the cities listed within our footprint. In a separate monthly index compiled by Ookla, Canada ranks as 11th in the world for download speeds. Results like this speak to Canada's position as a technology leader creating consumer choice and effective sustainable competition while providing employment and advancing infrastructure and possibilities in our communities

Facilities-based competition from Shaw and Freedom is working and will continue to work for Canada. As an industry, we are all expanding and improving our networks. Consumers want more from their providers, not less. We can offer these services and introduce new ones because we have invested significantly in the breadth and quality of our networks on which these services so heavily rely upon

The recent regulatory environment creates unnecessary uncertainty that has the potential to do more harm over the long term. If companies can no longer have the opportunity to earn an appropriate return, they will change their investment profile, and therefore, innovation, services and technologies such as 5G, Internet of Things and the fundamentals of artificial intelligence will diminish, along with the service levels that Canadians have been accustomed to. Canada requires strong facilities-based investment to compete on the global stage

Since the announcement of the wireless MVNO hearings and the reduced TPIA rates, we have already altered our plans with respect to launching new higher-speed Internet tiers and additional wireless expansion beyond our current footprint. Throughout the regulatory process, we are hopeful that the government will recognize the critical role that facilities-based companies play in the ability to usher in new technologies and deliver better and faster services for all Canadians

Despite the recent regulatory uncertainty, we couldn't be more pleased with our strategy and execution. To the entire Shaw team, the progress we have made over the past number of years is absolutely remarkable, and it could not have been done without you. We have challenged each and every one of you in your day-to-day roles, and response has been overwhelmingly positive. Let's continue to build on our success and carry this great momentum in F '20

Thank you, operator. We're now opening up for questions

 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [2]

Thank you, operator. Good morning, and happy new year, everyone. With me today are members of our senior management team, including Jay Mehr, Trevor English and Paul McAleese

As we embark on another year, the execution of our overall strategy remains the focus. We have delivered another quarter of stable Wireline results, and we continue to grow our Wireless and Shaw business divisions. We have also commenced some of our previously announced capital return initiatives as our consolidated Q1 results are in line with our expectations, including significant free cash flow in the quarter

In Wireless, we delivered both robust subscriber growth and strong financial results. We added almost 67,000 postpaid customers during a quarter when the pricing environment was extremely aggressive as it has been since the incumbent's launch of the unlimited plans last summer. The intensity of this dynamic drove both our gross additions and churn up over the prior year. Though, overall, we continue to be pleased with the quality and quantity of our subscriber growth, including increased ABPU and ARPU of both 4.1% -- 4.5% and 1% year-over-year, respectively, driving Wireless service revenue and EBITDA growth in the quarter

In Q1, we also began successively renewing subscribers from our initial December 2017 iPhone cohort. Despite these customers graduating during a period of intense promotional activity, we are pleased with the early results of our renewal programs. We continue to invest in improving our network for the benefit of our Wireless customers. The deployment of 700-megahertz spectrum is substantially complete in Western Canada, and we plan to be fully deployed in the east by the end of fiscal 2020

Within our consumer operations, we are steadily growing broadband RGUs, and we're delivering a better customer experience. In late October, we launched Shaw BlueCurve Total, which bundles our fastest internet speeds and IP video with a straightforward approach to rich content at an all-in price point that is attractive to the traditional or family-orientated consumer segments. This clearly had an impact in our subscribers in the quarter as the pace of video losses slowed considerably to our best result in over 2 years. As our IPTV availability continues to grow, now at close to 80%, so too does a number of customers choosing to self-install, which has increased to 48% in the quarter. Our premium Shaw BlueCurve services appeal to the family segment, while our newly launched Freedom Home Internet targets the younger, city-living and heavy data users. With our dual-brand approach, we have established distinct value propositions to meet the needs of different customers -- different customer segments, and we will continue to build upon this strategy in fiscal 2020

Overall, Wireline results in the first quarter were solid and in line with our commitments, which reinforces our free cash flow growth profile in fiscal 2020 and beyond

I'll now turn it over to Trevor to discuss the Q1 financial results in more detail

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [3]

Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. With some changes to the way we present our reported results, including the adoption and implementation of IFRS 16, let me walk through the numbers in a bit more detail

Consolidated revenue increased 2.1% to $1.3 billion, and EBITDA increased over 8% to $588 million. This includes a $38 million impact from IFRS 16. Excluding this new accounting standard, EBITDA increased 1.1% over the previous year, and as Brad mentioned, this was in line with our expectations

Wireline revenue in the first quarter declined by approximately 1.5%. The decline was due primarily to continued losses in the mature Consumer Wireline products, partially offset by growth in Consumer Internet and business. Note that for Q1 business results, the comparable year includes revenue from our Calgary1 data center, which was sold effective August 1, 2019, and if we adjust for the disposition, business revenue was up approximately 5% in the quarter versus a year ago

As we previously disclosed in our F '19 annual report, we have also made some minor reporting changes within our Wireline segment. Effective this quarter, revenue from our Broadcast Services and wholesale TPIA that was previously reported under the Business segment is now included in Consumer revenue. However, the prior period has also been adjusted so the figures are comparable. And we note that this change is only between segments, therefore, there's no change to overall Wireline revenue or EBITDA in F '19. The combined impact on revenue is approximately $36 million in F '19 that moved to consumer, which was previously reported under Business

Wireline EBITDA increased 3.4% this quarter, which includes $21 million related to IFRS 16. Excluding the accounting impact, Wireline EBITDA was in line with the previous year, and our margin remains strong at 46.5%. This reflects our continued focus on capturing operating efficiencies

First quarter Wireless service revenue increased over 18% year-over-year to almost $200 million, and EBITDA increased over 60% to $77 million, of which, $21 million was related to IFRS 16. Excluding the accounting impact, Wireless EBITDA was up 23%, and our Wireless margin improved over the prior year as we continue to scale the business

In terms of free cash flow, and as we have previously discussed, we have made some adjustments to management's definition to account for lease payments that are no longer classified as operating expenses under IFRS 16 as well as interest on lease liabilities recorded in the quarter. By making these adjustments, our Q1 and ongoing free cash flow will be comparable to historical results

In the quarter, we delivered free cash flow growth of 12% year-over-year to $183 million. As we near the end of VDP, approximately 370 employees exited in the quarter, and the program is now 85% complete. We remain focused on the execution of our strategic priorities, and we are on track to deliver both the VDP savings in the year and to achieve our stated fiscal 2020 commitments

Subsequent to quarter end, we were active in the debt capital markets. On December 9, we raised $800 million of senior notes comprised of $500 million 10-year notes at 3.3% and $300 million of 30-year notes at 4.25%. Following this successful offering, we completed the early redemption of a total of $800 million worth of bonds that were maturing in 2020 and 2021. Post our financing activities, our next significant maturity is not until November 2023

Our balance sheet and liquidity position continues to be strong. However, due to the implementation of IFRS 16, effective September 1, we were required to recognize approximately $1.3 billion of lease liabilities on our balance sheet to existing -- related to existing lease obligations. As a result, we updated our target net debt leverage range by 0.5 turn to 2.5 to 3x. And as at the end of Q1, our leverage ratio was 2.5x, which is at the low end of our revised target range

We've -- we also continue to have a fully undrawn 5-year $1.5 billion committed credit facility. And as part of our capital return initiatives that were announced in conjunction with our Q4 results and F '20 guidance, we repurchased and canceled approximately $25 million worth of Class B shares during the quarter

Brad, back over to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO &amp; Non-Independent Director   [4]

Thank you, Trevor. In summary, we are pleased with our overall performance in the quarter. We continue to make investments in our networks, including preparation for the deployment of 600-megahertz spectrum and small cells for an eventual 5G launch. We look forward to more clarity from the regulatory bodies as to how the future of the Canadian facilities-based wireless and wireline landscape will unfold. As our results continue to demonstrate, facilities-based operators provide the most effective, sustainable competition in the market and offer Canadian's innovation and real choice for their connectivity services

Operator, we will now take questions

 Before we begin, management would like to remind listeners that comments made on today's call will include forward-looking statements -- information, and there will be risks that actual results could differ materially.

Mr. Shaw, I will now turn the call over to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive Chair &amp; CEO   [2]

Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us. I just want to let you know from a logistics point of view, myself and the CFO are in Calgary, and the President of Shaw's in Toronto. And I think that's the day -- these days, we have to do it that way. So I just wanted to give you a little logistics update. But as I mentioned, with me today are Paul McAleese, President of Shaw Communications; and our Chief Financial and Corporate Development Officer, Trevor English

Before we begin, and on behalf of all of us at Shaw, we want to send our well wishes to everyone during these challenging and turbulent times, and we truly hope that each and every one of you and your families are healthy and safe. Today, we'll be discussing our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including our numerous employee, customer and community initiatives. We will also touch upon our second quarter results, which were solid and in line with expectations

To say that the events over the last several weeks have been extremely challenging would be an understatement, both professionally and personally. Due to COVID-19 and the significant uncertainty that surrounds it, many factors fall outside of our control, such as the duration and magnitude of the impacts on our business, the sector and the overall economy. The economic challenges from this pandemic are further amplified by the extremely low commodity prices, which will impact many that live and work in Alberta. We are still in the relatively early stages of this pandemic, making it challenging to know that the degree to which we could be affected. Our management team is closely monitoring the situation, and we are exercising agility and being disciplined with our actions. We are focused on the safety of our employees, the integrity of our networks, and the delivery of our products and services through our operational focus and on maintaining our strong financial position, including our balance sheet flexibility and ample liquidity. I believe that our business is resilient and that we will emerge in this crisis in an even stronger position. And I want to spend some time highlighting the key actions we have taken to support our employees, customers and our communities

First, it is incumbent on all of us to do our part to help prevent the rapid spread of this virus, and we want to send our deepest gratitude to those that are standing at the front lines, doing their very best day in and day out. This includes those that work in emergency response and health care, grocery stores, public transit and many other essential functions. It also includes our Shaw and Freedom employees that are serving our customers and maintaining our strong and critical networks. When Canadians need it most, your efforts do not go unnoticed, and we sincerely thank you

From the early days of COVID-19, we were ready to respond. The safety of our employees continues to be our priority 1. And upon initiation of our business continuity plan, we were able to transition approximately 5,000 employees to work from home. Within days, we implemented additional technology and tools that enabled more staff to work remotely, including our call centers. And we now have almost 80% of our total employee base safely and efficiently working from home. We still have a relatively small number of employees that are not at home as they perform essential functions for our customers. This includes retail staff at 20 of our corporate-owned wireless retail locations that continue to provide urgent customer service, network support teams who are managing our critical infrastructure and a limited number of technicians providing customers with assistance during these challenging circumstances

All operations are running smoothly. And we have frequent communication with all team members to ensure they are supported and that we keep everyone abreast of the situation as it unfolds. With the majority of Canadians now working from home, relying on video and voice interactions to remain connected, children and students accessing education in a virtual manner, and of course, our customers now utilizing our services as their primary form of entertainment, we have seen significant increase in traffic on our networks

On our Wireline network, traffic has increased by as much as 50%. And what used to be a peak period that lasted with 3 to 4 hours in the evenings has now become over 12 hours of peak usage 7 days a week. On our wireless network, we have seen a decrease in data trafficking, offloading the home WiFi networks as more and more Canadians follow the isolation and social distancing preventive measures being rolled out by governments. However, we have experienced a 25% increase in voice traffic as more calls are being placed to friends, family and colleagues on a daily basis

Our customers are relying on us now more than ever, and I'm proud to confirm that our facilities-based network performance has been exceptional. It is in trying times like these when Canadians deeply appreciate the value, the strong and reliable services that not only keep them connected and entertained but also provide them with the medium to carry on with their daily lives under social distancing measures. Facilities-based networks are no longer just a backbone of a digital economy, they have become the economic backbone of our country. While several important regulatory matters are still in front of us, facilities-based operators have showcased the strength during the difficult time, and we urge regulators to be mindful of Canada's relative strength on this front as well as the timing of their decisions as we navigate this period of uncertainty

Not only have we built network capacity that exceeds the significant increase in demand, we also have innovative products that can be self-connected without any need for a truck roll. This represents a competitive advantage as well as a way in which we can help further protect the health of our employees and customers by greatly minimizing occasions where the technician needs to enter a customer's premise. While customer activity across all our divisions is down, our customer self-connect metric has reached 100% in the past weeks. This accomplishment, along with our ability to pivot our call center staff to a work from home environment are concrete examples of the significant organizational efforts undertaken over the recent years to shift our operating model to one that embraces agility and a digital-first bias. This foresight is proving to be extremely valuable

In addition to providing critical and essential connectivity services, as an industry, we have collaborated in innovative ways and move quickly to support all Canadians as we navigate these uncertain times together. Whether it's through additional video channels, more Wireless data, opening our Shaw Go WiFi network to the public, providing free digital educational models for all Canadian students through our new partnership with EVERFI or donations to community initiatives to help those in most need. We are putting Canadians first

To our Shaw employees, thank you for the passion you bring each and every day and your dedication to serving our customers throughout this crisis. We know that rapid change and uncertainty can be difficult, which makes me even prouder of how we continue to support one another and optimistic of what we can accomplish during this unprecedented time

We do not yet know what lies around the corner or the full impact of COVID on businesses and consumers across the country. In the short term, we expect that some areas of Shaw will be impacted more than others, such as our business division, which provides many small business with critical connectivity services throughout our footprint. These challenges are further amplified here in Alberta, which is also being impacted by the rapid collapse in commodity prices. However, I feel confident that we are resilient. We provide critical and essential services to our customers and our communities, and Shaw will emerge as an even stronger organization as we continuously adapt and evolve our operations to meet and surpass demands of Canadians during these challenging times

I will now turn it over to Trevor to provide some more details on specific areas of our business that we are monitoring closely, some of the early impacts we are experiencing and our updated thoughts on our previously issued F '20 guidance. He will also briefly review the highlights of our second quarter results. Trevor?

Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [3]

Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. And I hope that you, your families and friends are all well and keeping safe during these difficult times

Let me briefly -- let me comment briefly on our second quarter results before I address our preliminary reviews regarding the COVID-19 impacts on our business. At a consolidated level, Q2 performance was solid and aligned with our plan, resulting in revenue growth of 3.7% and an adjusted EBITDA growth of 9.5% or 2% year-over-year when removing the impact of IFRS 16 in the quarter. Wireless subscriber and financial momentum remained strong throughout the second quarter, which included competitive holiday promotions for much of December and early January. We grew wireless postpaid subscribers by 54,000 and increased ABPU and ARPU by approximately 7% and 3%, respectively. Wireless adjusted EBITDA grew by approximately 18% compared to the prior year, when removing the impact of IFRS 16

In our Wireline division, we continue to focus on execution and delivery of stable and consistent results. Consumer revenue declined by 1.5% year-over-year, while business revenue increased approximately 5% when removing the impact of our Calgary1 data center disposition in the Q2 F '19 period. Excluding the $20 million impact from IFRS 16, adjusted EBITDA is comparable to the prior year. And year-to-date, we've generated free cash flow of $375 million. Our second quarter results were not impacted by the COVID-19 event or the challenging commodity price environment. However, in only a month's time, we find ourselves in a period of significant and unprecedented uncertainty. We are monitoring our key operational metrics and performance indicators across our organization daily. While we generally feel very comfortable that we can manage through this crisis, it is difficult, if not impossible to accurately or precisely predict the impacts on Shaw

Brad spoke earlier about the strength and capacity the networks deliver, and I'll provide some additional data and qualitative insights regarding some of the early impacts to our operations that we're experiencing. Not surprising, subscriber activity across the board is down significantly. For example, the temporary closure of the vast majority of our retail stores has meant that Wireless sales have slowed materially in the last few weeks. Customers are simply not making decisions to switch or alter their services during this time. However, this also results in significantly fewer disconnects. We will not achieve our Wireless subscriber loading targets this year, however, we do not expect that the lower net adds will have a material near-term impact on our wireless financial performance in F '20 due to lower acquisition-related investments. Although, of course, this is not our preferred strategy as we've been successfully scaling and growing our wireless market share over recent years, which was also an ambition for this year

We also expect that subscriber activity in our Wireline division will be considerably muted for a period of time. It is likely that some consumer and business behaviors will shift due to economic challenges, including possible downward package or ARPU migration, accelerated cord cutting and likely increased difficulty for some customers to pay their bills. While we do expect revenue to be impacted to some degree, we have significant operating and capital levers and flexibility to help protect EBITDA and free cash flow. Considerably lower customer activity will also mean that investments in promotions, subsidies and advertising will be lower than expected, which have helped to partially offset top line pressure

We've already reduced costs in some areas such as travel and discretionary spending, and we will continue to thoughtfully optimize our cost structure as required. Capital expenditures will likely moderate in the near term as growth and activity slows and some projects are deferred. In addition to the impacts from the pandemic, the pressure on commodity prices also represents a risk to our business. We generate approximately 1/3 of our consumer Wireline revenues from Alberta. Our business division generates approximately 35% of its revenue from Alberta. And for greater clarity, we generate approximately $140 million in annual revenue that is directly related to oil and gas and hospitality sectors, both of which we expect will continue to face an uphill battle for an unknown period. However, through our close relationships with our Business customers, we are proactively working with those that has experienced significant and immediate economic challenges

While we have seen an increase in pricing concessions in our business division in March and early April, we do not consider the impact to date to be material. We are providing essential and critical connectivity services to our Business customers as well. However, with limited visibility, it's difficult to estimate the impact to our Business customers across our footprint. We hope the challenges faced in businesses are temporary, and we continue to monitor this division closely as we believe that there's potentially more immediate, near-term financial risk relative to our Consumer and Wireless business. However, when we reach a period of stabilization, we believe that we have an opportunity for our Business division to be more disruptive and gain incremental market share as we have a strong portfolio of essential products

It is also important to keep in mind that Business accounts for approximately 10% of our consolidated revenues. Thus, we believe the overall near-term impact to our organization to be manageable. It is still early days, and we do feel comfortable with the daily trends we are experiencing. However, considering the significant uncertainty that exists, we are not able to predict the magnitude of the impacts over a longer time period as the environment continues to rapidly evolve. We believe a cautious and prudent view of our business and financial performance going forward is necessary. And we now expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA growth in fiscal 2020, and free cash flow is expected to be substantially in line with our previous guidance, which continues to support our current dividend levels. I believe it is worth reiterating the strength of our balance sheet, which has always been a strategic asset for us. Leverage remains at 2.5x, which represents the low end of our target leverage range of 2.5 to 3x. Post IFRS 16, we have no debt maturing until November 2023, and we're also in an enviable position from a liquidity perspective. We have a fully committed and substantially undrawn $1.5 billion credit facility, which was also recently renewed until December 2024

In this environment, investors have become increasingly focused on bank covenants, and I'm pleased to confirm that we are comfortably in compliance. Our debt covenant limit is 5x, and we're currently under 2x. While the fixed charges coverage ratio covenant requires a minimum of 2x, and we're currently at approximately 10x. This information was included in our Q2 MD&amp;A

In our press release, we also announced that we intend to suspend additional share repurchases under our NCIB program. This reflects the uncertain environment we are all operating in, and we believe investors are focused on placing more value on preserving liquidity and maintaining a strong balance sheet at this juncture. As a reminder, we have purchased and canceled approximately 5 million Class B shares as of the end of March at a total cost of approximately $130 million

Before turning the call back to Brad, I want to remind investors that while there are some near-term headwinds, we believe we are in a strong and enviable position compared to other industries or sectors. As a management team, we are focused on ensuring the safety and health of all of our stakeholders, including our employees, customers and shareholders. Our networks are performing extremely well, and we are providing critical and essential services to all of our customers. We continue to believe that we'll be able to effectively mitigate operational and financial risks, and we'll continue to deliver strong free cash flow that supports our dividends and liquidity in this uncertain and challenging environment

Brad, back to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive Chair &amp; CEO   [4]

Thank you, Trevor. I want to close by acknowledging the profound impact of my dad, J.R., had on this industry, our company and employees, and of course, on myself and my family. Many of you reached out with your condolences upon receiving the news, and I want to thank you for having our family in your thoughts and for your kind words. J.R. was a pioneer. His vision, 50 years ago was to provide choice and connect people to the things around them, and he always cared deeply for our employees and, of course, our customers. He was still very much involved and engaged in everything we were doing in our business. I will miss his guidance in the conversations dearly. However, I know he would be proud. He would be proud of each and every Shaw employee for, once again, rising to the challenge. He would be proud that our networks are providing critical services that keep customers, families and businesses connected. He would be proud that our facilities-based investments have proven invaluable in our daily lives during this time of crisis. And above anything else, he would be particularly proud of how we are all taking care of one another. His legacy will carry on and will be a beacon of confidence and perseverance for myself and each of our employees during these challenging times. While we pay tribute and mourn the passing of our iconic and exceptional leader, a father, a husband and a friend, I want to remind listeners that our company has a bright future. The Shaw family management team remains committed to our role as a leading provider of critical and essential products and services for Canadians. J.R. built this company to exceed the demands of our customers. And through the passion and hard work of our employees, we will continue to carry on his legacy for years to come

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive Chair &amp; CEO   [2]

Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us a little later than usual on a Friday afternoon. We apologize for the timing of this call, which is clearly not ideal for those in the Eastern Time Zone, as we've had some scheduling conflicts we had to work around. However, we are very pleased with the performance of our business over the last 3 months and look forward to our discussion this afternoon. With me today are members of the senior management team, including President Paul McAleese; and our Chief Financial and Corporate Development Officer, Trevor English

With the threat of COVID-19 still present, I hope everyone and their families are keeping safe and healthy. It is hard to believe that just 3 months ago, we conducted our first virtual Board meeting and investor conference call. Fast forward to today, and we just wrapped up another virtual Board session and the majority of our employees and Canadians are still working from home, navigating through an unprecedented environment

During this rapidly evolving and uncertain period, we delivered solid third-quarter results that were better than our initial expectations. I am so proud of the exceptional performance of the network and our people during the last few months. The pandemic has been a critical lesson regarding the importance of our facilities-based infrastructure and the role that it has played to keep Canadians connected and our economy running

Approximately 75% of our staff continue to work from home and are doing so productively. During the quarter, we introduced new products such as our Fibre+ Gig Internet service, and we relaunched retail locations with increased safety standards. Shaw Business moved quickly to accommodate businesses who had to close their doors due to COVID, and we have rehired approximately 50% of the staff that were temporally laid off in mid-April

In addition, we successfully assessed the debt capital markets at a very attractive rate to shore up our already strong liquidity position. I wanted to reflect on this tremendous work and take a moment to recognize all Shaw and Freedom employees that contributed to this performance. Your commitment to your colleagues, the company and to our customers are driving great results, and I'm so proud of our accomplishments during this time

While we are working towards having employees return to the office and perhaps different or more flexible work arrangements on a go-forward basis, we are taking a slow and cautious approach with their continued safety at the forefront of our decision-making. As you have seen from our Q3 operating and financial results, COVID had an impact on subscriber activity in both our Wireline and Wireless businesses. However, the financial performance in the quarter was very strong, as Trevor will discuss in a moment

Wireline performance was reflective of the critical nature of our connectivity services. While subscriber net losses increased in the quarter due primarily to lower sales activity and promotions, churn improved across all product categories, and our self-install performance continued to exceed our expectations, reaching 72% in the quarter

Canadians stayed home, but they stayed connected, thanks to our strong and extremely capable facilities-based infrastructure, such as our Fibre+ network. The demands on the network have been extraordinary with traffic that increased as much as 50%. Throughout this surge in demand, our network performance was and continues to be exceptional. We had no increase in congestion or material outages as a result of the billions of dollars of investment that we spent into building and improving our network over many years. These facilities-based investments have benefited Canadians immensely throughout this unforeseen crisis

We continue to improve our broadband infrastructure and services. And in the midst of COVID, we launched an even faster Internet speed with the introduction of our new Fibre+ Gig Internet plan. Available to over 99% of our footprint, this faster speed tier has already demonstrated its appeal to both new and existing customers, supporting the critical needs of Canadians during this difficult time

In the early days of the pandemic and as a consequence of widespread business closures, some of our Shaw Business customers requested a temporary suspension of their business service. These accounts, which were primarily in the hospitality and resource sectors are slowly coming back on billing in the recent weeks. We are optimistic that as the economy continues to reopen, we are well positioned to accelerate Shaw Business growth as we have a relatively low market share and a robust portfolio of products and services that can support businesses as they look to manage costs in a post-COVID environment

Temporary store closures, which included approximately 90% of our corporate Freedom locations, combined with the stay-at-home requirements that were present throughout the quarter, significantly reduced wireless sales activity and lowered postpaid churn to a record 0.96%. While the majority of our wireless retail network is now open for business, customer activity and store traffic has not yet returned to pre-COVID levels, and it is difficult to determine when customers' typically shopping habits will reemerge

Although our Wireless financial performance was enhanced by our lower subscriber activity in the quarter, our strategy remains to scale the business. While COVID temporarily slowed sales activity, we remain confident in our strategy and believe that as Canadians emerge from the crisis, we are providing compelling value to wireless customers across our footprint

Overall, we delivered Q3 results that were ahead of our expectations, reinforcing the essential nature of connectivity services and our ability to manage costs quickly and effectively in our business. That having been said, COVID and its related challenges will be a part of our story for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we continue to monitor the health of our business on a daily basis and remain agile in our decision-making and approach to serving our customers

Now I'll turn it over to Trevor to discuss the financial results in more detail

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [3]

Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. I hope everyone has been keeping well and enjoying your summer so far. However, I'm sure it's a bit normal -- a bit different than normal

As Brad highlighted, we are very pleased with the financial performance of the business this quarter during an uncertain and an unpredictable environment. At a consolidated level, revenue of $1.3 billion was approximately $10 million lower than the prior year. This was primarily due to lower Wireless equipment sales. In fact, removing Wireless equipment revenue from the equation, our consolidated revenue was up approximately 1.4% versus a year ago. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA increased over 15% to $609 million, which includes $38 million related to IFRS 16. Excluding accounting impact, we delivered EBITDA growth of over 8%

As we discussed on our last earnings call, our Wireless business benefits financially in the near term from lower customer activity. Despite some softness on roaming revenue during the quarter, we still delivered service revenue growth of 17% to $206 million, driven by continued strong Wireless ABPU and ARPU growth of 5.7% and 2.6%, respectively

Wireless delivered substantial adjusted EBITDA of $101 million in the quarter, which included approximately $18 million related to IFRS 16. Removing the accounting impact, Wireless adjusted EBITDA growth was a remarkable 57% increase compared to the prior year. Decreased acquisition-related costs, including subsidies, advertising and other sales and distribution costs contributed to this performance. The strong Wireless adjusted EBITDA result is tangible evidence of the significant operating leverage in the business

In our Wireline segment, consumer revenue decreased 1.3% to $923 million, and Business held steady at $140 million in the quarter. Wireline adjusted EBITDA increased almost 7% to $508 million, which includes approximately $20 million related to IFRS 16. And as a reminder, in Q3 last year, we had a $15 million payment related to IP licensing matters. And when adjusting for the onetime charge and IFRS 16 in the quarter, the year-over-year performance is comparable

While we have not experienced any material changes in consumer behaviors or trends to date, we did have some business customers temporary suspend or canceled some of their services throughout the quarter as they were dealing with COVID-related impacts on their business, not all of which has been fully reflected in the Q3 results considering the timing of the suspensions. While our Q3 business results are better than our initial views, revenue growth stalled from its historical run rate of approximately 5% year-over-year growth to roughly flat in the quarter and down approximately 3% versus Q2

In the third quarter, we recorded a modest $5 million increase in our bad debt provision associated with the increasing levels of unemployment and continued uncertainty in the small and medium business sector, although to date we have not experienced a material change in customer payments in either of our Wireline or Wireless segments

Capital investments were largely as per our original budget and flat in the quarter compared to the prior year, as the business performance remained stable and projects that we thought would have been delayed such as new building development, were actually accelerated in some instances. However, we did experience a decrease in success-based capital, including CPE and capitalized labor due to lower activity and a higher percentage of customers electing to self-install

In Q3, we generated free cash flow of over $220 million and $595 million on a year-to-date basis, which is 20% higher than the prior year and in line with our outlook and commentary regarding fiscal 2020. Our balance sheet remains strong with Q3 leverage of 2.4x and a substantially undrawn $1.5 billion credit facility and approximately $650 million of cash on hand. As Brad mentioned, in April we issued $500 million of 10-year senior notes at an attractive rate of 2.9% to further enhance our liquidity position

In summary, we are very pleased with our financial performance in the quarter. As we look forward to Q4, we do expect some spending that was delayed in the quarter to return, particularly around marketing and base management support costs as well as the potential for any further adjustments to bad debt provisions as we continue to monitor the payment trends of customers

However, we are very confident in the underlying performance of the business. Connectivity remains an essential service for residential and business customers, and we believe we're well positioned to meet and exceed the demands of our customers. With this strong foundation, we are pleased to confirm that we continue to expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA growth in fiscal 2020, both obviously on a pre- and post-IFRS 16 basis, and substantial free cash flow in line with our previous guidance of approximately $700 million

Brad, back to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive Chair &amp; CEO   [4]

Thank you, Trevor. While it is still too early to predict with a high degree of accuracy the magnitude of the COVID-related impacts on our business, we continue to believe that the telecom sector is fundamentally strong and resilient. Under the most difficult and challenging set of circumstances, our network performance was exceptional, and we delivered better-than-expected results. We know that additional investments will be required in the future to keep ahead of usage trends while connecting more Canadians

Canada is one of the best-connected countries in the world by design, and we are hopeful that the regulatory framework will continue to support innovation and long-term capital investment. As the economy begins to reopen, we are confident that our robust broadband and Wireless infrastructure will continue to play a vital role and drive our economic recovery

Thank you, operator. We'll now take questions

Presentation

Operator   [1]

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Saga Communications Q2 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn this over to your host, Ed Christian, President and CEO of Saga Communications. Sir, the floor is yours

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Edward K. Christian,  Saga Communications, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Chairman   [2]

Thank you, Catherine. And Sam Bush is with me, and he will speak momentarily, but at least Sam, Catherine was good enough to say welcome to, rather than unwelcome to Saga for the conference call

We have some good things to talk about and some harsh reality to deal with. So with that, Sam?

Samuel D. Bush,  Saga Communications, Inc. - Senior VP, Treasurer &amp; CFO   [3]

Thank you, Ed. This call will contain forward-looking statements about our future performance and results of operations that involve risks and uncertainties that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent Form 10-K. This call will also contain a discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation for all the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are attached in the selected financial data table

The second quarter was materially impacted by business and service provider closures, restrictions and other government-mandated actions. From the gross revenue low point in April when Saga's gross revenue was down 55% compared to the prior period in 2019, our revenue has significantly recovered in each of the following months, with July's gross revenue being down approximately 29%

And I think it's important to point out that from a broadcast cash flow perspective, only April was negative, while May and June both showed positive broadcast cash flow. We do expect to show positive broadcast cash flow for the year if the current market conditions continue due to our efforts to reduce expenses and with the expectation that we will see ongoing month-to-month revenue improvements. We had more cash on hand at the end of the second quarter, $48.9 million compared to the end of first quarter of $46.3 million. We expect there to be some fluctuation in this amount as the year continues but we do not believe, it will be reduced by any material amount by year end

Again, this is if the current market conditions continue, and we don't face another prolonged government-mandated shutdown in our markets

At the end of the quarter, our outstanding debt remained $10 million, which given the cash on hand, presents no covenant or liquidity issues. I'm sure a lot of other broadcasters and businesses as a whole will be envious of this statement

I want to point out that Saga's reported net loss for the first 6 months was $3.2 million but only $564,000 after adjusting for the noncash impairment charge, net of the tax benefit associated with the impairment charge

Ed, with that short commentary on an unprecedented quarter, I will turn it back over to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Edward K. Christian,  Saga Communications, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Chairman   [4]

Thank you, Sam. For the last few days, I've been listening to other conference calls. And I am kind of numbered out because as when listening to the calls, it's -- we're down this, we're down that. The numbers are there and here is what it is. And after a while, you just kind of glaze over because we know what they're going to be. And it's interesting because for all the years that I've been in this business, we kind of run in -- even though we're all independent operators in -- or public companies or whatever it might be. But the trend is amazing in terms of how it really sticks together and holds true across the entire country. I was talking with another broadcaster the other day who is -- has about as many markets as we have, but they're not in a single one of our markets. And we said, okay, come on, let's share some stuff here. How did you do during the quarter? And what are you seeing going forward? And we went through the numbers. And within 1 percentage point, we were the same as this company. Totally different markets, similar sizes, mid-market, but it was a very interesting experience. But I really need to ask everybody's permission here to just kind of digress from the numbers for a minute and really begin to look behind the numbers. What do they mean? And that's the issue that we really have to get down to is when we look at the numbers, they don't really tell us much. It shows a percentage of business down, and we can start breaking it into categories and try and say, okay, in this category, in medical, we were down 42% or 55% or whatever the number is. What does it really mean? Where does it come from?
 Now admittedly, there were parameters set where the governors closed business, made certain things on that. And those are the things that we can't change. There's nothing we can really do to entice somebody in to advertising during those points in time. But what about the other ones? And what did we learn about our experience here and doing an analysis on it?
 Well, I think there was a lot of things that came out of it for us. And one of the things that we really began to see early on was that a lot of good businesses who didn't need to close were closing because of fear. And I think that's really what happened in a lot of areas was that the fear factor came into play or a business person would say oh, my god, if I don't stop spending right now, I could lose my business. I could lose everything I have. I could be upside down. And I always remember a lot of quotes from one of my favorite, I guess, it would be an intellectual in Edmund Burke said back in the 1700s, mid-1700s, "no passion efficiently robs the mind of all of its powers of acting and reasoning as fear does." And I think that's really true. I mean, really no passion effectively robs the mind of all of its powers of acting and reasoning as does fear

So what we're saying here is that what we learned was that we had to really change the paradigm. We had to change the way we were selling. We had to be more enabling with the client, more encompassing of the client and their problems. So we began to understand that they were not advertising because -- not because they couldn't, because they were afraid to advertise

That's a very interesting distinction, but it's true. And we found that out. So we really had to change the method, the way that we were working with them. We didn't let them validate their fear because we came in and really worked with them in different ways to show them why they had to be advertising during a pandemic. Why they had to be doing this and what they can do. And we targeted certain ones that we knew that had the potential to do so but were afraid if they spent the money and they didn't get a return that they could be going out of business

And there's one of the things that I've learned over the years, sometimes the hard way. But I remember one of my first radio jobs in sales. And the owner of the radio station in Detroit, Michigan, said to me, did I ever tell you the story about the man who sold hotdogs? And then I go, no. And he said, okay, let me tell you the story. There was a man who lived by the side of the road and he sold hotdogs. He was hard of hearing, so he had no radio, had trouble with his eyes, so he read no newspapers. But he sold good hotdogs. He put up signs on the highway telling how good they were. He stood on the side of the road and cried, buy a hotdog mister and people bought. He increased his meat and bun orders. He bought a bigger stove to take care of his trade. He finally got his son home from college to help him out. But then something happened

Son said, father, haven't you been listening to the radio? I like that line. Haven't you been reading the newspaper? Don't like that. There's a big depression. The European situation is terrible. The domestic situation is worse

Whereupon the father thought, well, my son has been in college and he reads the papers. And he listens to the radio, so he ought to know. So the father cut down on his meat and bun orders, took down his advertising signs. And no longer bothered to stand on the highway to sell his hotdogs. And his hotdog sales fell almost overnight. You're right, son, the father said to the boy. We certainly are in the middle of a great depression

Again, once again, the idea of being influenced into having the wrong thoughts. So we really decided that we would go after and do a lot of great things to try and change the relationship with our people. And let me just tell you a few of the things we did because I'm really proud of what we came up with from the stations. And Chris Forgy did an outstanding job of communicating all of the ideas out. And that is from March through June 20, during the -- I hate to use the word, pandemic, our markets, Saga markets, donated over $10 million to local advertisers. Yes, we would go into them and say that, look, you shouldn't stop. Well, but business is really tough, and I don't know if I'm going to make payroll or everything else. All right. But you can't stop because you need to continue your marketing. So we're going to carry it for 2 months. We're going to do it. Don't worry about it. Don't ask any questions. Your commercials will stay on the air because we know that you need to keep your top of mind awareness. We need to know you have your presence there. And the clients will look at us unbelievably. What you're going to give us free advertising? No, it's not free advertising. It's letting you know that you're a valued relationship to us. Since you've been with us for 10 years. And now it's our turn to help you as you have believed in us, now we believe in you, and we're not going to let you down during this time right here. By the way, this number does not include the value of free promotional time supplied to local businesses to promote curbside pickup and shopping local, et cetera. That was totally other different campaigns we did for them

We also identified and created and sold a new creative ideas to emerging categories that are not typically radio advertisers. This, again, it gets down to the fact that traditionally, radio has sold certain categories, the sellers go out and call the same people, get the same results, nothing else changes. And we said, there's a lot of people out there that could benefit from using radio and the reach on radio. And so we went out and we started looking at them, finding unusual categories

Recruitment. We all know about that one. Sleep apnea clinics, yes. Ear, nose and throat doctors. Yes, pawn shops, metal roofing, personal injury and bankruptcy attorneys, residential real estate, contractors, HVAC, doors and windows, aftermarket auto parts, optometry, pet daycare grooming facilities. And the idea that we sold was Too Hot For Spot. Okay. That's a good one. And it was a combination, public service and advertising campaign, providing helpful hints on how to keep your pet safe from extreme heat during the summer. Hair salons, obviously, they couldn't be open. But what we did was we had an on air campaign during the pandemic called Show Us Your Roots. Since many hair salons were closed during the start of the pandemic and consumers weren't able to get their highlighted. The promotion was a fun way to support the local hair salons and keep them up on top of mind, while at the same time, it provided hair salons with leads to those who entered the contest. And we created all these new initiatives for our sellers and (inaudible). We also gave away just on the air, and we talked about the (inaudible), be giving away $15,000, $10,000 and $5,000 in advertising to clients. All you have to do is go to our website and register your name. And we'll do a drawing. And we'll have 3 winners. One will get $15,000 in free advertising across the platform of stations we have in the market. Other one will get $10,000, one will get $5,000. And it would average about 400 people registering for this

Now you're wondering, okay so you're giving way free advertising. Well, the ones that did, and it was a drawing, were just ecstatic about this, oh my God, I can't believe that. We get free advertising. We can continue on doing what we're doing. And by the way, we also then got 400 leads of businesses that we knew that were advertising. And we sent our salespeople out with $500 gift certificates and had them go in and talk to the owner and say, listen, we're sorry, you didn't win. But here, just from us, is a certificate for $500 that you can use at any time to advertise on the stations and just mail us the certificate and we'll work with you on that, and we'll get it done

So what we do -- by doing this, we created 400 lead opportunities to divide it up amongst the sellers and did that. The other thing that we did is we produced over 4,000 spec spots for our local advertisers in 3 months. 4,000 new commercials in 3 months to present to them as idea starters for it

So we look at this, and these are the things that actually kept us from being down further. And it allowed us to get to a lower level where we are now in the high 20s and going down from there to try to restore a level of normalcy. But if we can cure the fear factor and we can make this a fun factor, then we're so much further ahead in the business. And the other thing we've been doing is train, train, train. I can't tell you the amount of training and retraining that goes into this. And the new people that we've hired in sales are a clean slate. They're not coming in and say, well, look, we've been doing it this way for 20 years. They don't know the difference. And when we tell them to go out and call on this product category, a lot of the senior sellers would say, oh, they're not going to buy. But the new ones will go out and just power right through and do that. Change is here. Change is occurring. Changes is what's happening in our business, and we have to stand behind it. And that's exactly what's going on here. And we're also selling long-term and again, it's great with the young sellers coming in that they're suddenly -- if you tell them, look, we only sell in 10 weeks or 12 weeks. Another seller would go on who's been there for a long time, and so I can get a $500 order for next week. Now we don't want that. We're in for the long term. We're building and rebuilding our business. So this has been a terribly challenging and terribly painful time for us in broadcasting. It has also given us a chance to feel reinvigorated with a new commitment that we have towards doing what we do to service our communities. We chose to be in mid-markets, where we actually can make a difference. Where we can know that people listen and respond to us because they depend upon us for what goes on in the community. And we're using that power and the power of being able now to change the way we've been doing business and bringing ourselves into a new relationship and a new era is going to pay off very much so in the long term. We are concentrating and building on local direct and local direct services. And that's where the bread and butter is going to be and that's where the future of local radio is. And that's where it is. I'm not worried about cheap spots from a national -- on national. That's gone from the game. That's changed. Let's do and control what we can control and let's do it the right way, and we'll be in great shape on this. I just want to be the best that we can be in our particular era -- area, era too, but that's where it is. And no, it was not a good quarter. As I said, painful for all of us. And you sit here each week and go, Oh, and then you have to begin to understand what happened. And that's what we did. And I just want to thank you all for listening to my rambles, I guess, this morning. But I hope I gave you an idea and a vision of what we're trying to accomplish at Saga. It's been our goal. We've been in business 34 years. I thought it was bad in 2008. That was a walk in a park compared to what we've experienced. And if everything is right and our projections hold, even though we have no real visibility in terms of going forward on this. But if we do, we'll get through this. We'll be fine. And a sense of normalcy will return to what has become a very harried industry in the last several months

But bear with us. We'll do what's right. We'll get through this

And Sam, I don't think we have any questions today, do we?

Samuel D. Bush,  Saga Communications, Inc. - Senior VP, Treasurer &amp; CFO   [5]

No, we did not have any questions today, Ed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Edward K. Christian,  Saga Communications, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Chairman   [6]

All right. Do you have any questions?

Samuel D. Bush,  Saga Communications, Inc. - Senior VP, Treasurer &amp; CFO   [7]

No. But I can say I always like my comments, but yours are always much more fascinating to listen to. So thank you for that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Edward K. Christian,  Saga Communications, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Chairman   [8]

Well, go buy yourself a hotdog, keep the old man happy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Samuel D. Bush,  Saga Communications, Inc. - Senior VP, Treasurer &amp; CFO   [9]

I will do so

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Edward K. Christian,  Saga Communications, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Chairman   [10]

Catherine, you can wrap this thing up, and we're out of here

Operator   [1]

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Shaw Communications Fourth Quarter 2020 Conference Call and Webcast. Today's call will be hosted by Mr. Brad Shaw, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer of Shaw Communications. (Operator Instructions) The conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) Before we begin, management would like to remind listeners that comments made during today's call will include forward-looking information, and there are risks that actual results could differ materially. Please refer to the company's publicly filed documents for more details on assumptions and risks. Mr. Shaw, I will now turn the call over to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive Chair &amp; CEO   [2]

Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking the time to join us to discuss our results for Q4 and fiscal 2020. With me today are members of our senior management team, including our President, Paul McAleese; and our Chief Financial and Corporate Development Officer, Trevor English. As we close in on almost 8 months since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, it has undoubtedly altered many of the everyday tasks in our lives and injected a new level of uncertainty across all industries and businesses. We have also been impacted at Shaw, however, throughout this crisis, we have demonstrated the strength and resilience of our business and strong execution and engagement from all of our Shaw employees throughout a time of significant change

With the health and safety of our employees as the priority, we shifted to work from home, effectively managed the significant increased traffic on our networks, accelerated digital programs, including self-install and supported our communities. In fiscal '20, our critical high-quality connectivity services have never been more essential to the lives of our customers, as usage soared and remains materially above pre COVID levels today. During the pandemic, we launched new broadband services, including our Fiber+ Gig Internet service to virtually all customers in our operating footprint

Importantly, our Gig Internet service is now available to over 1 million more customers than our main competitor, showcasing our leadership position with respect to the breadth and capability of our robust Fiber+ network, the direct results of years of facilities-based investments. As further validation, just last week, Ookla named Shaw the fastest and most consistent Internet provider in Western Canada. Our digital initiatives are being embraced by our customers in this environment. In Q4, 79% elected to self-install a broadband service compared to 45% a year ago. The result of which is an improved customer experience and cost-effective solution that has proven valuable as social distancing remains a priority

Our focus on profitable customer interactions and cost management resulted in an improved Wireline margin for both the quarter and the year. Changes in our broadband pricing and disciplined promotional investments impacted subscriber activity in addition to COVID. However, we believe our focus on customer profitability is a prudent and effective approach, considering the maturity of our Wireline products and services. Shaw business delivered approximately 2% revenue growth in F '20 as the COVID impacts were more pronounced in the small and medium-sized business sector. However, the team did an excellent job of proactively working with our customers to find unique and personalized solutions that continue to support them through this difficult period

Small businesses are at the heart of our economy, and we are proud to serve and support them, particularly through these hard and difficult times. More recently, Shaw business added to its unique line of smart products, providing customers with additional tools and solutions that support a robust and secure work from home environment. Earlier this week, we announced our partnership with Teck resources and Nokia to launch Western Canada's first dedicated 5G ready private LTE network for mining projects. Just another example of how our business unit is adapting to and embracing the evolving needs of our business customers with new services and technology

In our Wireless business, Q4 marked an important milestone for our company with the introduction of Shaw Mobile on July 30. The customer demand for this innovative service has outpaced our expectations and has remained strong. The launch was supported with new Shaw branded stores as well as additional sales channels through our national retail partners, including the expansion of our partnership with the mobile shop, who now offers both Internet and wireless services

Although COVID-19 had an impact on wireless customer loading and the competitive environment continues to intensify, we delivered strong wireless net additions of approximately 60,000, 15% growth in service revenue and 25% EBITDA growth in the quarter. We were also one of the only wireless providers in Canada with ABPU and ARPU growth for the year, including our strong Q4 performance that saw these metrics increase approximately 7% and 4%, respectively

We believe we are well positioned with our 2 wireless brands to drive continued subscriber growth, increase retention through our funneling initiatives and improved customer account profitability. Our significant accomplishments in fiscal 2020 were achieved while managing through a pandemic and simultaneously growing our business. As Trevor will discuss in a moment, we are very pleased with our financial performance in 2020, delivering consolidated EBITDA growth of 3.7% and an increase in free cash flow by nearly 40% to approximately $750 million

These results are a culmination of our robust facilities-based networks, our focused strategy and our strong execution by the team. I want to thank our employees for going above and beyond every single day. And particularly those on the front lines that continue to serve our customers. Now I'll turn it over to Trevor to discuss the financial results in more detail, including our expectations for F '21

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Trevor English,  Shaw Communications Inc. - Executive VP and Chief Financial &amp; Corporate Development Officer   [3]

Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Considering the unique and challenging environment that emerged throughout the year, we are very pleased with our Q4 results and our overall fiscal 2020 performance, which deliver growth that was largely in line with our original guidance that we issued last October. We are proud of our results and the execution by the team considering the amount of uncertainty that we faced as the virus spread, commodity prices collapsed and parts of the economy shut down

Our consolidated Q4 performance continue to deliver stable results, with adjusted EBITDA growth of 3.7% due primarily to strong Wireless performance in the quarter. Our Wireline segment has been resilient throughout the COVID pandemic, including business revenue that has stabilized. However, uncertainty does remain. While Wireline RGUs were soft in Q4, the broadband pricing that was implemented at the end of May, alongside reduced promotional investments have supported ARPU growth across all products

Combined with the overall effective cost management, we grew adjusted EBITDA by approximately 1.4% on a pre-IFRS 16 basis and improved our Wireline operating margin in both the quarter and year to over 48% on a reported basis. Wireless service revenue increased approximately 15% in the quarter on the back of continued subscriber additions as well as ABPU and ARPU growth of 6.6% and 4.2%, respectively. On a pre-IFRS 16 basis, Q4 wireless adjusted EBITDA growth was approximately 25% over the prior year

Turning our attention to F '20 annual results, while customer activity was impacted by the pandemic, our Wireless business -- or pardon, our Wireline business remains stable throughout the year. Adjusted EBITDA grew approximately 1% and profitability improved. Our Wireless segment, which continues to face an intense competitive environment added over 160,000 new subscribers, and we delivered service revenue growth of over 17% in F '20 to $815 million and adjusted EBITDA growth for the year at over 30%

Consolidated capital investments of approximately $1.1 billion were largely as planned. There were no material changes in our capital projects for F '20, considering our business performance. Wireline spending continues to decline even with record usage on our network. This reflects decades of significant facilities-based investments. Wireless capital spending in 2020 supported the deployment of spectrum additional retail locations related to Shaw Mobile and preparations for the delivery of a 5G wireless service

Our focus this year resulted in substantial free cash flow of almost $750 million. This represents significant growth over prior years and is a direct result of our focused strategy to enhance our connectivity business and the transformation of our organization become more agile and capitalized on efficiencies. With a strong free cash flow in F '20, we returned approximately $610 million to shareholders in the form of dividend payments and an additional $140 million from the repurchase of 5.6 million Class B shares through our NCIB program

As we look forward to fiscal 2021, we maintain a great deal of confidence in the strong fundamentals of our business as well as we're excited about the new initiatives that will support our growth and strategic focus going forward. In F '21, we expect to generate continued positive EBITDA growth, capital investments of approximately $1 billion and free cash flow of approximately $800 million. While historically we've provided an EBITDA growth range with our outlook, we continue to be faced with ongoing uncertainty related to COVID and the unknown impact key areas of our organization, including Shaw Business and overall sales activity within our Wireless and Wireline segments

However, we remain focused on delivering stable Wireline results and growing our Wireless business, supported by our robust facilities-based networks and a continuous focus on capturing efficiency opportunities. Our consolidated capital investment profile is moderating, and we're generating more than double the free cash flow compared to just 3 years ago. Yesterday, our Board approved the renewal of our NCIB program, which enables us to repurchase up to 5% or approximately 25 million Class B shares

While our NCIB activity was paused in April, as COVID was unfolding and we elected to preserve liquidity, we continue to have considerable balance sheet strength with leverage of 2.3x, which is again below our target range and significant liquidity, including a cash balance of $760 million with no near-term debt maturities. With stable performance of our business and improving and strengthening free cash flow profile and an attractive dividend, we continue to believe that an NCIB program is a flexible and efficient means to return additional capital to shareholders. Brad, back to you for closing remarks

Thank you, Trevor. I am so proud of our performance and our team over this past year. We are moving forward with our strategy on our front foot and remain committed to enhancing the customer experience while providing additional value to Canadians. Fiscal 2021 will bring new and enhanced services to both Wireline and Wireless customers. We will focus on bundling opportunities with Shaw Mobile, to deepen existing relationships and build new ones

We will continue to enhance our wireless network with the deployment of critical spectrum to enable 5G service this year. And we will further advance our digital initiatives to improve the customer experience and reduce the overall cost to serve. While we have accepted that our new environment is different, we are excited to continue playing a critical role in the lives of our customers. In closing, I'm very pleased to announce the nomination of Steve White to our Board of Directors. Steve has an extensive background in operations and deep knowledge of the cable industry

For the past 11 years, he has served as President of Comcast Cable Division in the Western United States and has held senior positions at AT&amp;T broadband and telecommunications. We look forward to Steve's contributions beginning in January. Thank you. Operator, we will now take on some questions

Presentation

Operator   [1]

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Saga Communications Q3 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)
 It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Ed Christian, President and CEO of Saga Communications. Sir, the floor is yours

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Edward K. Christian,  Saga Communications, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Chairman   [2]

Catherine, thank you very much, and welcome, everybody. We have a lot of information to convey to you and some other additional thoughts. And with that, let me start by turning it over to Sam Bush, as usual

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Samuel D. Bush,  Saga Communications, Inc. - Senior VP, Treasurer &amp; CFO   [3]

Thank you, Ed. This call will contain forward-looking statements about our future performance and results of operations that involve risks and uncertainties that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent Form 10-K. This call will also contain a discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation for all the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are attached in the selected financial data table

The third quarter continued to be materially impacted by the COVID pandemic, but as reported in the press release, we have seen significant increases in net revenue every month from the low point in April. Our net revenue in the third quarter was $24.1 million compared to $16.9 million in the second quarter. This is an increase of $7.3 million or 43.1% between the second and third quarters

Gross political for the quarter was $1.8 million. For the second quarter, it was $289,000 and for the 9 months ended September 30, 2020, it was $3.1 million

As I already indicated, net revenue was up $7.3 million from the second to third quarter. So political certainly helped, but was not an overriding factor. Political continued to be strong in October and for the first few days of November. So we expect October to be our highest revenue month for the year with November remaining strong, but falling below October as political revenue was finished yesterday

Without political, we expect gross revenue to continue a positive trend throughout the rest of the year. Our focus on local continues to pay off as the combined local direct and local agency increased 32.4% between the second and third quarters of this year. We have $49.8 million in cash on hand as of November 2 compared to approximately $44 million at the beginning of the year. We expect there to be some fluctuation in this amount as the year continues, but we believe that our cash balances will continue to increase as we get to year-end. Again, this is if the current market conditions continue, and we don't face another prolonged government-mandated shutdown in our markets

At the end of the quarter, our outstanding debt remained $10 million, which given the cash on hand, presents no covenant or liquidity issues. Leverage per our bank covenants calculates at 0.82%, but is really negative when you consider the cash we have on hand

Ed, with that short commentary on what continues to be an unprecedented year, I will turn it back over to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Edward K. Christian,  Saga Communications, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Chairman   [4]

It could be precedented year, I don't know, Sam. But let me ask you a quick question. What did you compute the other day that the value of the cash per share of what it's currently trading at is like, what, $6? Something around that?

Samuel D. Bush,  Saga Communications, Inc. - Senior VP, Treasurer &amp; CFO   [5]

Yes. Around number $6 per share

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Edward K. Christian,  Saga Communications, Inc. - President, CEO &amp; Chairman   [6]

Okay. So I'm just checking that up

Hello, everybody, and let's start in on this with me saying that it's been a long 9 months, and we have not burned $1 of your money. There's been no cash burn at this company, which I think unto itself, is a pretty good achievement. And we accomplished this through a number of different ways, and let's talk about that for a second

One was, obviously, 2 things that you have to do is one is try to find a way to reverse the slide and bring it back up so that it decelerates each month in terms of that and begins to build back up a little bit. We haven't seen the rebuilding from ground 0 yet from -- or normalcy as it was from 2019. But nevertheless, we've had some really interesting things happen

Let me tell you, for instance, that if we look at our local direct, and for those of you who have been on the call before know that Saga's big proponent of doing, reaching, teaching, selling directly to retailers, to service providers, to a number of the businesses like that. Right now, we're running about $1.5 million per month ahead of our local direct. Overall probably our local directors, excuse me, $1.5 million over our local agency, which is pretty impressive for us. It really continues our commitment and accelerates it, which is -- we're very happy about that

We're adding more programs to promote nontraditional revenue. We're doing, for instance, best of books with sales component attached to it, which is bought in hundreds of thousands of dollars and the lack of -- because of the lack of nontraditional revenue

Where we have been impacted and it's a good, healthy number is in events. And a station that is attuned to the community is constantly looking for events to provide for the community. And I am finding ways for us to monetize those events. And it goes from concerts that we sponsor in Ocala to plays. We are behind in various performing venues across in our markets

So we have a lot of things going that generate additional income. So we've been impacted because we're not able to reach out and have masses of people or numbers of people even attending our events, and that was a big part of what we did. And that really hurt when the country was shut down. And even now today, we're seeing that there's no shutdowns in Massachusetts and Illinois. We're just rechanged and recategorized in certain counties

So while the competitors are off-boarding salespeople, which is what's happening, we are actually hiring them and adding services and account executives. We're very big in the idea of retraining our new salespeople or training -- retraining existing salespeople and training the new salespeople

We're using a number of different programs when we bring in new sales people. P1, the RAB, Radio Advertising Bureau has a tremendous program and Cash by Creative, there's a number of different programs that we are showing and telling to our people. We're -- and then we're also breathing the people that we have for the future. Because we believe sincerely that there is a future without a doubt, there is a future on this

Just to give you one example. We work with [Jeff Smith] and Kim Johnson at the Radio Advertising Bureau, and they did for us a special 6-week virtual training session for Saga own way, where we took a number of our senior salespeople. And nine of them took the course for 6 weeks, and they just earned their credentials as certified radio sales managers. These are people that are there for us in the future because we've been building our team and building our field on what we're doing. So it's keeping in content, keeping in promotions where we're still trying to figure out ways to do for promotions

Examples, some of the ones that we have right now that we did for promotions, and it just occurred to me to mention this is we did a number of virtual Halloweens. And in Champagne, Illinois, for instance, we did it at the Champagne County fairgrounds, where we had 30 merchants with booths or tents along the road inside the area there. And passing out candy to each car that stopped, and we had a line, it's probably 1.5 mile long outside of cars waiting to get in with their kids in their Halloween costume to enter into the area and do it. It was all sponsored by us exclusively. And the [story] invited paying businesses were there to hand out information to the parents. We did quite a bit there. We also, in one of the other events that is kind of important to mention right now is, we did a program for sponsorship to support first responders, the police and fire. We did imaging and the conversational messages with top officials, discussing relevant community issues, and what is brought to you by at the end. And that's created hundreds of thousands of dollars for us. We've done it in 18 of our markets so far, and we're rolling it out in all of the markets, and that will be happening pretty soon

So one of the other things that we're doing now to reposition the station because I think it's -- well, Paul Romer, who's an economist and Nobel Prize winner, he's a Stanford economist, had a great line, it says, in a crisis -- a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. And what we've been doing is using this, while other companies are offloading talent. We have been raising and hiring those talents and improving our stature in terms of professionalism. It's been really great. While the other ones are having risk, we are hiring talent. So we're taking advantage as much as we can of what is going on in the community

This is all a part of the idea that we have here of keeping Saga fresh and current even in downturns times right now. This has been a very important part to us to be able to have what we do and be able to say, hey, listen, we're still making money, not the kind we want to, but the kind we want to will be coming. We don't know exactly the definition yet of when coming is because it's subject to a number of variables. But by doing the things that we have been doing, by increasing the commitment to our salespeople, bringing in new salespeople and training them in the new methodology of selling. And there is one, by the way. The things have changed in terms of how we're doing it. It's not the same old radio sales of 20 years ago, but it's using new more inventive things. It's also relying upon digital advertising sales as a component to what we're doing

So in every area, every single department that we have, there has been a concentration and a commitment to make them better during this time. So that when a sense of normalcy returns and other people begin to open up their radio stations, and by the way, which we never closed any of our stations. But when they open up the radio stations again to try to resume business, we're ahead of the pack on that. And that's part of the whole idea of what we do is try to position ourselves in the community as community leaders, community relations, one-on-one relationships with our advertisers, and we'll get back there. And the very fact that we haven't had anything embarrassing occur to us in the last 9 months, I think, is applauded to all the people who work for the company and who really work hard to see what they're doing

I'm pleased as much as one can be pleased. That's a very touching thing right there. But I'm pleased with what we're doing. What I'd like to see more, of course. Am I going to see more? Yes. We have that commitment behind there that we're not going away. We're not going to fold up. It's unfortunate that radio stations have closed in a country and some licenses have been mailed back to the government, and that's more in some of the smaller markets

But it happens. And we're seeing even large companies turning unnecessary radio licenses. We're not. We're actually looking for some acquisitions in our market field. I won't say smaller markets, but that's a relative term, but we're doing that. So what I ask is your understanding and your patience. And we're no different than a lot of other companies that got whacked. Only we're trying to do proactive things to change this, and the proactive things are in sales and that's what is important to us

There -- I got -- I'm big in quotes and things like that, as you know. And I saw one the other day, I thought it was pretty good now to sum this up here. And that is one from Arthur Rubenstein. For lovers of you who may not be familiar with him, he was a concert pianist from 8 decades as one of the finest contra pianist in the world. He was an expert in Chopin, and he had a great thing. He said there was no formula for success except perhaps an unconditional acceptance of life and what it brings. And why did that reside with me. And that's what we have is we have to face the issues that we have and deal with and fix our company, keep our company strong, keep our company focused, keep finding ways to grow the company, to inspire the people in a company to be committed to the company, to have that in their heart knowing that this is the company that will be long-standing, whereas some others might go by the wayside because of economic conditions

And Sam, with that, I'm going to wrap up my comments after you've got -- I don't know. Do we have some questions today?

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Shaw Communications' fiscal 2008 second-quarter conference call. Today's call will be hosted by Mr. Jim Shaw, Vice Chairman and CEO. (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS)

Before we begin, management would like to caution listeners that statements made and answers to questions during today's call will include forward-looking information that are based on certain important factors or assumptions, and that there are risks that actual results could differ materially from any forecast or projection. These factors, assumptions and risks are discussed in the Company's management discussion and analysis for fiscal 2007 and for Q2 2008, and in today's quarterly press release, which are publicly filed with the Canadian and US securities regulatory authorities. Listeners should refer to the information in those documents

Mr. Shaw, I would like to turn the call over to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - Vice Chairman and CEO   [2]

Thank you, operator, and thank you for attending, all you listeners today. And joining us, as in the past, I will introduce the Shaw team. There will be a brief discussion on some comments, and this will leave ample time for, hopefully, any questions you have concerning our Q2 results. Of course, with me today are Peter Bissonnette, President; Steve Wilson, Chief Financial Officer, Brad Shaw, Senior Vice President of Operations for Cable; Michael D'Avella, Vice President of Planning; Ken Stein, Vice President of Regulatory; and Jim Cummings, Vice President of Operations for Star Choice. And of course I'd like to also announce that hiding in the back of the room is my father, the Executive Chair of Shaw Communications, who wanted to listen in today, given the results that we were pleased to release yesterday

We were pleased with the operational and financial results we achieved in the second quarter. Consolidated EBITDA improved by over 15%, and year-to-date, we have generated almost 230 million in free cash flow

For the second consecutive quarter, we reported strong customer additions relating to our digital phone and digital TV businesses, both of which represent the largest quarterly gains in the Company's history. We now have over 650,000 digital customers, and over 30% of those are HD

Digital phone continues to be rolled out to some of our smaller systems, and the service is now available to 90% of our homes passed. We currently have over 0.5 million customers subscribing to our telephone service

The operational performance experienced during the first six months of this year puts us well on track to achieve our previous free cash flow guidance of 450 million. We anticipate -- somebody walked by here and got me just on the wrong line

We anticipate that our solid performance will continue during the remainder of this year, and we are updating our preliminary guidance for EBITDA. We now expect it to grow in the approximate range of 13 to 15% during fiscal 2008. This is up from the 10 to 12% previously

As you all know, we have submitted an application to participate in the upcoming AWS spectrum auction, which is scheduled to begin on May 27. We won't have any comments on wireless or that auction today, but I am sure you will all appreciate the process has been set up by Industry Canada, and our ability to comment further, due to the competitive bidding dynamics of the auction, does not allow us to comment on the auction

And again, I would like to close by just saying thank you for joining us. It's an exciting time at Shaw. The team has done a tremendous job in achieving the goals we've set forward, and even overachieving. And we look forward to now opening up the lines to answer any questions from analysts and other people. Thank you, operator

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Shaw Communications' fiscal 2008 third-quarter conference call. Today's call will be hosted by Mr. Jim Shaw, Vice Chair and CEO. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. (OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS). If the press has any questions, please contact Mr. Shaw's office after the call

Before we begin, management would like to caution listeners that statements made and answers to questions during today's call will include forward-looking information that are based on certain important factors or assumptions and that there are risks that actual results could differ materially from any forecast or projection. These factors, assumptions and risks are discussed in the Company's management discussion and analysis for fiscal 2007 and for Q3 2008 and in today's quarterly press release, which are publicly filed with the Canadian and US securities regulatory authorities. Listeners should refer to the information in those documents. Mr. Shaw, I will now turn the call over to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chair &amp; CEO   [2]

Thank you, operator and welcome, everybody. As in the past, I will introduce the members of the Shaw team and make some brief comments before taking questions you have concerning our third-quarter results

With me here today is Peter Bissonnette, President; Steve Wilson, Chief Financial Officer; Brad Shaw, Senior Vice President of Operations, Shaw Cablesystems; Ken Stein, Senior Vice President of Regulatory; Jean Brazeau, Vice President of Regulatory; and Jim Cummins, Vice President of Operations, Star Choice

It has been another strong quarter for Shaw Communications. Subscriber numbers are up across all products and services. Consolidated revenue is up 13% for the quarter. EBITDA improved by 15% during the quarter. Year-to-date, we have generated almost $310 million in free cash flow

In the third quarter, we purchased land and buildings near our existing facility in Calgary to consolidate our office locations and rationalize our operations. Even after this capital investment, we remain on track to achieve free cash flow guidance of approximately $450 million for fiscal 2008

Following the recent decision by the Federal Court of Appeal on the CRTC Part II fees, we have begun to accrue for these charges. This will result in an additional $22 million in costs for the year. However, even after consideration of these higher fees, we continue to maintain our EBITDA guidance of 13% to 15% growth for fiscal 2008

Digital lines increased by almost 58,000 during the quarter and we now have 550,000 digital phone customers. In just over three years since the launch of this product, digital phone penetration stands at 28% of basic customers who have the service available to them. We launched a digital phone basic service geared to customers with less need for phone features and long distance to broaden the appeal of our service. Our digital customer base continues to increase and we now have 40% of our basic customers subscribing to digital. We continue to expand our high-definition lineup and during the quarter, we added two more high-definition channels

As you know, the Canadian AWS spectrum auction that began on May 27 has not yet finished. We won't have any further comment on wireless on the auction today due to the fact the auction continues. I am sure you all appreciate the process that has been set up by Industry Canada and our inability to comment further due to the rules of the auction. However, it is interesting though to see a process so clearly driven by foreign money. We just hope that when the auction is over and the bidders are qualified, that they all can recite the words to the Canadian National anthem. Or what is that other song, Peter?

Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [3]

Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump --

Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chair &amp; CEO   [4]

Okay, with that, I would like to thank you for joining us and operator, we will turn it over to questions now

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [2]

Thank you, operator. Good morning and good afternoon to our eastern callers. I'm Jim Shaw, Vice Chair and CEO of Shaw Communications. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and year end results. With me here today is Brad Shaw, Senior Vice President of Operations, Steve Wilson, Chief Financial Officer, Michael D'Avella, Senior Vice President of Planning, Ken Stein, Senior Vice President of Regulatory, Jim Cummings, Vice President of Operations for Star Choice, and [John Brasso], Vice President of Regulatory Affairs. And before we open our lines to our regular dialogue and your questions, I would like to make a few comments. It's been another strong quarter and year for Shaw. Even though the competitive environment has increased, we continue to add customers across all product lines and services throughout the year. In the quarter, we added over 4,000 basic customers and during the year, we gained over 20,000 basic customers. Digital phone had record customer gains again this quarter, and we now have over 610,000 digital phone lines. 30% of our customers -- basic customers who have service available to them now subscribe to our phone products. The service has been rolled out to over 90% of our customer base, which represents a 10% increase over the last year

Digital TV had a record year, adding over 140,000 customers, with our wide range of HD services. We continue to view digital as a compelling growth opportunity for our Company. The launch of the Frame service in HD is an example of how we will continue to add future value with unique services for our customers. Our continued focus on our customers, our commitment to improving our customers' experience through enhancements through our product offerings, innovation through introduction of new services and providing exceptional service has helped us deliver yet another year of strong financial results. With annual revenue up some 12% and EBITDA increasing some 14%, we achieved record consolidation cable and satellite margins. Growth and free cash flow almost $100 million to over $450 million was accomplished in conjunction with significant capital investments in facilities, future growth, and we'll maintain our leading network performance

We have never been stronger financially and this continues to provide us with the opportunity to return the majority of free cash flow to our shareholders. In 2008, we repurchased $100 million worth our Class B non-voting shares and dividends paid to shareholders increased over 50% to over $300 million. Following our latest dividend increase, which became effective in September, our annual rate is now $0.80 per Class B share and our yield continues to rank in the top 10 of the TSX 60 index. Our focus again over the next year will again be on customers. We plan to expand options available to enhance our performance and services, which will further improve our strong competitive position. As an example, we will be rolling out a digital rental program in the next few months. We have significant opportunities to expand digital penetration. And this program will provide customers access to all the features and benefits digital TV has to offer. In these increasingly difficult economic times, we believe customers will appreciate the opportunity to enhance their in-home entertainment options in a manner that provides compelling value. This is a great opportunity for both our customers and our Company as the economics behind digital have improved considerably. Set top boxes have evolved, costs have decline, digital programming has continued to improve, all of which has increased digital ARPUs by 20% over the last two years. And the rental fee associated with the program will yet provide another stable, recurring revenue stream for your Company

Our main competitor in western Canada continues to have technology challenges with their TV service and we have noticed that in a few communities, they have begun laying fiber to the home. And as we know, this will be a long and very expensive process. We have also noticed that Bell recently introduced the concept of same day/next day, a program that we have offered for over three years. I guess imitation is the best form of flattery. In this case, they didn't quite get it right. Bell is charging $60 for the same day/next day service, but at Shaw, it's included. We will be launching DOCSIS 3.0 in 2009. This will further differentiate ourselves, our internet service from the competition. These new generation cable modems will offer speeds up to 100 megabits per second. With DOCSIS 3.0, Shaw customers will be using a fire hose while our competition is left offering only a watering can

Looking to fiscal 2009, our preliminary forecast for EBITDA in the cable division is for 10% and modest growth in our satellite division. We will continue to make prudent investments to meet our current and long-term strategic goals. In this competitive environment, we need to be able to respond to the evolving market conditions rapidly. So we are not providing specific capital expenditure guidance at this time. We cannot afford to limit our flexibility to make investments that will keep us in the lead. Our strong historical operating track record speaks for itself and we are confident that we will generate free cash flow for our shareholders of at least $500 million. As everyone knows, the Canadian AWS auction concluded during the fourth quarter and we were successful in acquiring 20 megahertz across most of our cable footprint at a cost of $190 million or less than 5% of the total auction proceeds. We continue to review our wireless strategy and believe our entry into this market should be measured and prudent and reflect the developing competitive wireless dynamics. As a result, we do not anticipate material wireless investments during 2009. Quite frankly, our view is that anything that requires a lot of cash up front for an uncertain future return is not in keeping with what the market is looking for today

Our focus is on investing in our core video, data, broadband, and digital phone businesses in a manner which will generate near term growth and returns -- and which also provides -- improves our competitive position. The idea of spending $1 billion for a long-term future return on wireless, simply wouldn't be in our DNA and certainly not in a volatile and uncertain conditions we are experiencing in the market these days. In light of recent market developments, we plan to continue to execute our strategy of discipline -- disciplined and prudent growth while returning capital to shareholders. The recent turmoil in global credit markets and concerns regarding the length and depth of a possible recession are concerning for everyone. However, we believe we are well positioned to succeed in this environment, and our recent share price performance has been strongly -- strong relative to the overall market. Our products provide strong value for our customers and we should see continued success in our (inaudible) and residential phone products

Our business generates sufficient cash flow. We are not in need of short-term credit to fund any of our operations. We have no significant debt maturities over the next 18 months. We have $1 billion credit facility committed to 2012 and at the end of September, we have drawn less than $200 million on that facility. We believe the value proposition that we provide our customers is attractive. And the services we offer are still required and demanded by consumers. Even during periods of depressed economy -- economic activity, we believe our shares offer compelling value at these levels and the recent buyback activity completed by the Company since the end of August supports this statement. Once again, I would like to thank you for joining us and I would now like to turn it over to questions for the team here at Shaw. Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - Vice Chairman, CEO   [2]

Thank you, operator, and welcome, everybody, and thank you for joining us here today. With me today are Peter Bissonnette, our President; Brad Shaw, the Senior Vice President of Operations; Steve Wilson, Chief Financial Officer; Michael D'Avella, Senior Vice President of Planning; Ken Stein, Senior Vice President of Regulatory; Jim Cummings, VP of Operations for Star Choice; John Brasso, Senior Vice President of Regulatory Affairs; And Jay Mehr, Group Vice President of Cable Operations

You received our results and had a chance to review them so I won't go through a lot of the numbers in any kind of detail but before we start our discussion, I would like to make a few more general comments. The current economic uncertainty requires discipline and prudence. We at Shaw are exercising on both that discipline and prudence and we have a strategy that is working for our stakeholders and we intend to stick to it. We are concentrating on our core businesses that deliver consistent returns rather than chase gold mines with unsure returns in the future revenue streams. Our strategy is to deliver quality products and services at competitive prices, stay focused on our customer and manage our capital structure in an efficient and responsible manner

We recognize that as our customers hunker down to ride out this recession, there will be growth opportunities for us and I think this quarter you've just started to see that. Our sub numbers were strong. Our basic additions exceeded additions in the same quarter even a year ago, when the economy was a lot stronger

We introduced the digital rental program or option to our customers at the end of October. This program, and the continued adoption HD and HD PVR by our customers, helped contribute to that 100,000 digital customer additions. Now being over 1 million digital customers, driving digital growth revenue streams and opportunities, reduced customer churn, and represents to us what we see as an attractive return on capital invested

Our digital phone business continues its steady and impressive growth. This is the fifth consecutive quarter where our quarterly customer additions have exceeded 50,000. Currently, one-third of our cable customers now take our digital phone service product

Financial results for Q1 were strong and we believe that growth rates are attractive in the context of current economic climate. We are managing our capital expenditures and have a tight control on costs. Our margins remain Best-in-Class when compared to other North American cable operators. Free cash flow of $113 million gives us comfort with our ongoing guidance of $500 million for the year. The largest free cash flow target we have ever set for our Company. In these tough times, we feel that cash is king and we will not be deploying our cash flow in anything but a prudent and efficient manner

Operationally, we remain in great shape. Our customer base gives us the opportunity for solid growth and will help us ride out this economic uncertainty. We continue to have significant liquidity available to us under our existing credit facilities, and we have no debt maturities until 2010 and 2011. And our leverage matrix remains conservative

S&amp;P recently upgraded our corporate debt to investment grade. Considering the economic and capital market environment today, this upgrade further validates our operating characteristics and the outlook for our business and our moderate financial risk profile. We are now rated investment grade by two of three agencies. The Board believes we are well-positioned in the current environment and earlier today we announced a dividend increase of 5% or $0.84 per share. This is further evidence that the outlook for our business and our shareholders is only positive. We have started the year with solid results. We are committed to that strategy. Serving the customer with a solid value proposition that is more appropriate to today's consumer sentiment than ever before. Value, reliability, service, and a multitude of range of products, all on one bill

Before I conclude, I want to note on the passing of Ted Rogers. He was a giant of the industry, an exceptional Canadian entrepreneur. He will be missed by all the people at Rogers, his many friends in the industry and by all of us here today, especially the Shaw family, the Shaw Board of Directors. He set a high standard that drove all of us to dig deeper, compete harder, think more, and hustle faster. So Ted, good bye my friend. Thanks for joining us today. I would now like to turn it over to questions

 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chair   [2]

Super. Thank you, Michelle, and welcome, everybody, for joining us here today. And I will just run through the distinguished list of guests with me. And I would like to start with Peter Bissonnette, who is our President and new member of the Shaw Board and actually is going on the cover of Popular Mechanics next month; Steve Wilson, Chief Financial Officer; Brad Shaw, Senior Vice President of Operations for all the Company; Michael D'Avella, Senior Vice President of Planning; Ken Stein, Senior Vice President of Regulatory; John Brasso, Senior Vice President of Regulatory also; Jim Cummings, VP of Operations at Star Choice; and welcome to the group today Jay Mehr, who is now Group VP of all the Shaw Cable operations

You have received our second-quarter results and have had a chance to review them, so I won't go through them. I wouldn't bore you that way. But before I start, I would like to make a few comments

Over the past three months, news regarding the economic situation around the globe and here in Canada continues to worsen. Consumer anxiety and concern over the depth and length of the economic difficulties remains quite high. Considering the economic environment that -- we find it troubling that various groups are trying to oppose -- impose additional taxes at this time to fund private enterprises that would ultimately increase costs for Canadians. This includes the continuous lobbying from the broadcast industry regarding the fee for carriage and the proposed tax regarding Internet services to promote Canadian content on the net. We believe this tax goes against the fundamental principles of the World Wide Web of free and open access to content

Based on our results this quarter, it is clear that despite challenging conditions, Shaw is well positioned to weather the storm and continue our track record of superior financial performance and customer growth. Western Canada continues to perform relatively well. We have not seen a material change in demand for entertainment and communication services in our market

Shaw's core strategies are focused on our customers. We strive to provide quality customer service, deliver valuable products and services at competitive prices. We want to be the provider of choice for our consumers, and execution of these goals will help cement our status in our customer home

The telcos have decided to spend a significant amount of capital to launch new services, and to date we believe they have had limited success. It is unclear whether the economics of their investments will ever pay off. In today's environment, we have committed ourselves to the following through our core strategies -- to focus on our key businesses. This focus has been successful in the second quarter, with solid financial results and positive subscriber growth across all business lines. Our 100,000 new digital customers this quarter represents an all-time record for Shaw

The success of our digital rental program, the growing demand for HD have helped us to exceed more than 1 million digital cable customers. The rental option allows more customers to enjoy the experience of digital cable, including its interactive programming guide, additional specialty channels, and VOD and pay-per-view services. We believe customers are making a conscious decision to spend more of their entertainment expenditures on in-the-home alternatives, and this bodes well for our digital TV business

Digital represents a tremendous growth opportunity for us, considering our penetration rate compared to other MSOs. And to our Internet product -- continues to outpace the competition, and in Q2 we put ourselves further ahead with speed increases that were introduced free of charge to our customers. Our Shaw High-Speed product now saw a 50% increase in speed to 7.5 megabits. Shaw High-Speed Xtreme-I also got a speed improvement to 15 megabits. Shaw High-Speed Warp is the fastest Internet service in Canada. We have continued to differentiate our Internet service with the launch of DOCSIS 3.0. This new 100-megabit service will be rolled across our footprint throughout the rest of this year

Our digital phone, which was launched four years ago this quarter, actually, today accounts for almost one-third of our customers, and almost 700,000 people subscribe to it. We have now achieved six quarters of 50,000-people-a-quarter growth. It has been just unbelievable. The financial results were solid, consistent. EBITDA was up 9% compared to last year, and still our margins remained the best in class

We believe these results are strong despite the current economic climate. Year to date, we have generated over CAD250 million of free cash flow and are totally on track for our guidance of CAD500 million

With the upgrade by Moody's and S&amp;P, which I'm sure Steve will talk about later, we have investment-grade status by all three ratings. We believe these movements in the current economic environment validate the outlook and show the quality of the asset that we have here and you as a shareholder have in the Company that we are talking about here today

Considering the capital market volatility, we were actively monitoring the market to take advantage of financing windows, as we have CAD1.6 billion in debt maturing over the next two years. We felt that it was prudent to eliminate some of that funding risk early, and at the end of March we completed a CAD600 million 6.5% offering of five-year senior notes. This financing represents an attractive all-in cost of debt. Considering our capital structure, we are using the proceeds to pay down bank debt, redeem some outstanding notes. Excessive cash from this offering and our undrawn CAD1 billion line of committee credit facility, which doesn't expire until May 2012, will be used to fund additional maturing debt in 2010 and 2011

We remain totally confident of offering reliability, excellent service, new innovation and value to subscribers that will benefit every shareholder of Shaw, even as the Canadian economy has a bit of a downturn

We are prudent; we are disciplined; we are very focused. We have a really top team here. And you know what? While the future is not clear, I can tell you that from my point of view, this is the number one cable team, satellite team and the best operator in North America. And you know what? I would like to thank you for joining me here today. And we would now like to turn over to questions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications - President   [2]

Thank you, Operator, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. In our Company's quest to be the best when you have the opportunity to share the day with the best you do it. As a result, Jim and Brad won't be joining us today as they had a once in a lifetime opportunity this morning to play golf and share experiences and insights with Tiger Woods. Rather than scheduling the call later in the day before a summer weekend, we decided to proceed with this earlier time instead. However, in their absence, we are pleased to have our Founder and Executive Chair on the call with us today, J.R. Shaw. Along with J.R., we have a number of our senior management with us including Steve Wilson, our Chief Financial Officer, Michael D'Avella, Senior Vice President of Planning, Ken Stein, our Senior Vice President of Regulatory, Jean Brazeau, Senior Vice President of Regulatory, Jim Cummings, who is the Vice President of Operations for Shaw Direct, and Jay Mehr, the Group Cable Vice President of Operations. We will keep our comments short as you have already received our results for the third quarter

We continue to execute in the current economy with discipline and prudence. Western Canada's economy is not immune to the pressures that the rest of North America is facing. But as you can see from the quarter's subscriber figures, we continue to grow across all of our business segments despite the economic conditions and increased competition. However, much of this competition is being price-driven, highlighting the lack of differentiated features in our competitors' products

We had another quarter of solid subscriber additions. In fact, our base of cable net additions in the quarter and year-to-date exceed results from a year ago. Our digital business had another record quarter as we added over 110,000 customers. Since the beginning of the year, our digital penetration has increased by 12 points, and we now have over 52% of our customers taking our digital service

Revenue and EBITDA growth remain strong, and our consolidated margin improved almost 46% this quarter. This represents an increase of 50 basis points over the last three months. Our operational performance continues to place us among the best in North America. At year-to-date, we have generated over CAD405 million in free cash flow, and we remain on track to achieve our free cash flow guidance of CAD500 million in fiscal 2009

We continue to monitor market conditions, and we will be releasing details regarding fiscal 2010 guidance in conjunction with our fourth quarter results in October. We do not believe the economic environment has turned the corner yet, but based on our results this quarter and throughout fiscal 2009, we are confident that we will continue to be able to weather the storm and continue our track record of superior financial performance and customer growth. Thanks for joining us today. We would like now to open the phones to answer any questions

Welcome to the Shaw Communications fiscal 2009 fourth-quarter conference call. Today's call will be hosted by Mr. Jim Shaw, Vice Chair and CEO of Shaw Communications

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [2]

Thank you very much. I will keep my comments short today so you have already received our results, which were released earlier today. 2009 was another successful year, and we continued to execute our customer-focused strategy with discipline and guidance

In the fourth quarter, we, again, achieved positive subscriber acquisitions across all of our products, which contributed to a strong year in 2009. Almost 930,000 digital customers, 310,000 Internet customers, 220,000 digital phone customers and almost 30,000 basic customers

These results were achieved in an increasing competitive environment and during a period of significant economic uncertainty. In fact, our basic subscriber additions for the fourth quarter and [fiscal] 2009 exceeded figures from a year ago. These results reinforce the value proposition of our products and services and our commitment to exceptional customer service

We continued to invest significant amounts of capital in our business to improve infrastructure, innovation, products, and to meet our customer needs. We increased our Internet speeds, and we are the first ISP in North America to offer 100 megabit-per-second service

We invested in our digital HD and video-on-demand businesses, and in just one year, we have grown our digital penetration from 40% to almost 60%

We have invested in the vital infrastructure, back-office support, IT systems, and people to ensure we meet that demand, and now we are at 11,000 or 10,500 employees

Since 2005, we've invested over CAD3 billion in capital, and we believe these investments are key to continued success in our future. Consolidated revenue and EBITDA were up over 9% during 2009. Free cash flow improved by CAD50 million to over CAD500 million. And including the impact of cash taxes in the fourth quarter, this represents a growth of 17% compared to '08

We recently completed a significant refinancing transaction raising CAD1.25 billion at attractive rates for 10 years, redeeming all of our higher-priced dollar-denomination debt. This is the largest 10-year BBB issue ever completed in Canada and the second-largest nonfinancial domestic deal ever done

Besides lowering our overall cost of debt by approximately 80 basis points, we eliminated most of our refinancing risk over the next three yaars, as the next significant debt was due in that period

Looking forward to 2010, we released our forecast on consolidated EBITDA growth of at least 14%. Similar to last year, we are not providing capital expenditure guidance at this time, as we need to be able to respond to evolving and competitive markets and conditions. However, we will continue to make appropriate investments to meet our current and long-term strategic goals

In 2010, we expect to generate free cash flow comparable to last year. This is a significant accomplishment considering more intense competition and the impact of a full year's cash tax burden

So, operator, that really ends my comments. I could say that, you know what? We are still the number one cable company in North America. We continue to be -- we have the number one management team, and we continue to show overall, overall. So that's it

 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc., - CEO and Vice Chairman   [2]

Thank you, Operator, and thanks to everyone for joining us today to discuss our first quarter results. With me today are Peter Bissonnette, President of Shaw Communications; Brad Shaw, who our Board and I recognized today for a tremendous job he's done in operations by promoting him to Executive Vice President; Steve Wilson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Michael D'Avella, Senior Vice President of Programming; Ken Stein, Senior Vice President of Regulatory; Jean Brazeau, Senior Vice President of Regulatory Operations; Jim Cummins, Vice President of Shaw Direct; and Jay Mehr, Group VP of Operations. I will keep my comments short as you have already received and reviewed our results that were released earlier today

2010 is off to a strong start and we remain on track to achieve our EBITDA and free cash flow targets which were issued last quarter. As a reminder, our 2010 preliminary guidance for free cash flow was that it would be in line with our 2009 actual results of CAD500 million. This is impressive considering the heightened competitive environment and the impact of being fully cash taxable this year. We had a board meeting, an AGM meeting earlier today and we are pleased to announce a 5% increase to our dividend to an annual rate of CAD0.88 per share. This increase becomes effective in March and continues our track record of returning capital to our shareholders

Thanks for joining us today. That will conclude my remarks and we're open to any questions you want for any one of us, so thank you

 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO and Vice Chairman   [2]

Thank you very much, and you know, operator, -- and I think thank everyone for joining us today to discuss our second-quarter results. With me today we have -- actually a privilege, we have the Chairman is available to sit in on the call, so he will be in on the call. But with me today are Peter Bissonnette, President; Brad Shaw, Executive Vice President; Steve Wilson, CFO; Michael D'Avella, SVP of Planning; Ken Stein of Regulatory; Jean Brazeau, also Senior Vice President of Regulatory, Jim Cummins, Vice President of our Shaw Direct Operations, Jay Mehr, Group Vice President (technical difficulty) Shaw (inaudible) operations. Somebody is ringing there

I will keep my comments short as you have already received and reviewed our results which were released. Our financial performance in 2010 has been solid. This quarter we experienced double-digit year-over-year revenue and EBITDA growth along with strong customer results across all our products. We recently surpassed 1 million HD customers, and we are approaching 1 million digital phone customers as 42% of our basic customers now take this service

We announced today that we're advancing our wireless strategy to offer a competitive offering, and we are planning an initial launch in late 2001. Accordingly, we are accelerating our wireless capital expenditure and expect to invest approximately CAD100 million [more] in 2010. We are excited about this opportunity to enhance our products and offerings wireless service. And also, we are excited about using our base, which is now, I don't know around three or -- Peter (multiple speakers) 3.4 million customers, to use it to our advantage

In February we announced our intention to make an equity interest in investment in a restructured CanWest Global. We believe this is a unique opportunity to invest in one of Canada's top broadcasters, and we are excited about the potential integrating cost multiple content platforms with VOD and all broadcast and everything. However, at this time we cannot comment further on that status of that transaction as the matter is currently before the court

So I guess I will conclude by saying thank you for joining us today. Now we would like to open up the lines to answer any questions you have. (multiple speakers) oh, did I say 2001? Oh, 2011. I have been corrected by the Chairman. I hate when that happens. Okay, operator, so let's open it up

 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [2]

Welcome to our third-quarter results, and thank you for joining us here today. With me today we have our whole top team, which would be Mr. Peter Bissonnette, President; Mr. Brad Shaw, Executive Vice President; Mr. Steve Wilson, Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Michael D'Avella; Senior Vice President of Planning; Mr. Ken Stein, Senior Vice President of Regulatory; and Mr. [John Repko], Senior Vice President of Regulatory also -- you know, it's kind of a duplicate there -- and Mir. [Jamie Rigo], Vice President of Shaw Cable Operations; and Mr. Jim Cummings, Group Vice President of Satellite Operations; Mr. Paul Robertson, Group Vice President of Broadcast Services (inaudible); and also Mr. Trevor English, who works in our whole investment area. So we are happy to welcome you here today

I'll keep my comments short, as you have already reviewed our results, which were released this morning. We continue to post impressive financial and operating metrics that reinforce the strength of our core cable and satellite businesses. Both revenue and EBITDA for the quarter was up 10%, as subscriber growth was strong across all product. We added basic customers in Q3, and our digital penetration rate is now approaching 70%

This quarter we added over 66,000 Digital Phone lines, and this represents our highest-ever net additions in a quarter since launching the service in 2005. These results were achieved with a focus on profitability, as our consolidated margin for the quarter exceeded 46% and our cable margin was almost 49%

(inaudible) was an important milestone regarding our proposed acquisition of the Canwest broadcast assets. The court approved matters relating to the acquisition, and we are working on completing the remaining steps in the transaction, including securing the regulatory required approvals. We expect this acquisition to close in the fall of this year. We continue to develop our wireless business plan. And we're pleased to announce that we have chosen (inaudible) as our equipment vendor for our network growth

We also have recently hired [Lawrence Kruk] as our new Vice President of Wireless. Lawrence joins us with extensive knowledge and experience in the wireless industry, both in Canada and abroad. We will provide further updates on our wireless initiatives as we approach our launch of the service

We are excited about the future of our Company. Our core business continues to be resilient in the face of heightened competition, and continues to generate significant amounts of free cash flow. We believe our expansion into wireless and our acquisition of one of the premier providers of content will position us to be one of the leading entertainment and communication companies in Canada

So with that, thanks for joining us here today. We now like to open up the phones to answer any questions before everyone leaves for probably a long deserved long weekend with your family

 Jim Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Vice Chairman   [2]

Thank you, operator, and thanks for everyone joining us today. I apologize that we are having this on a Friday because we usually like to try to have it on a Thursday, so I will say that right up ahead

With me today are members of our top-notch management team, including Peter Bissonnette, President; Brad Shaw, Executive Vice President, soon-to-be CEO; Steve Wilson, Chief Financial Officer; Mike D'Avella, Senior Vice President of Planning; Jean Brazeau, Senior Vice President of Regulatory; Jay Mehr, Group Vice President of Cable Operations; Paul Robertson, Group Vice President, Shaw Media; and Jim Cummings, Group Vice President of Shaw Satellite Operations

I will keep my comments short, as you have already reviewed our results which were released earlier this morning. 2010 was an exciting year for our Company. We declared our intentions regarding wireless and to date have spent CAD100 million related to design and construction of our core network. Upon CRTC approval, which is expected later today, we will be acquiring the broadcasting assets of Canwest, including global networks and a portfolio of some 21 specialty channels such as HGTV and The Food Network

We expect to close this transaction by the end of the month. Looking forward to physical 2011, we expect continued growth in our core business overall for satellite, cable, and we expect robust free cash flow growth to approximately CAD550 million. These figures do not improve the new media assets, which will immediately be accretive to free cash flow

We also continue to invest in our wireless network in advance of our scheduled launch, and we plan to spend an additional CAD200 million in 2011 on this strategic initiative

Before taking questions, I wanted to address the recent leadership changes that were announced this morning. I have had the pleasure of working at Shaw for the last 28 years and leading the organization as CEO for the last 12. It has been an unbelievable experience. While I am proud of our successes, of the management team we have assembled, J.R. and myself and confirmed by the Board felt that it was time for a new leader to take the reigns, and we all felt that Brad was the right person for the job

Brad has been with the Company for over 20 years, and for the last several years, has played an increasingly important role in the leadership and strategic direction of our Company. I am confident he will continue to move the business forward. I wish him all the success as the new CEO effective at the Board -- at the annual meeting coming up. I mean I hear, there's lots of rumors out there were doing this because Jim is sick and that. We're not doing that

We're actually doing it because we're going to expand the management team, so as I remain on as Vice Chair, J.R. is Chair still. Brad coming in as CEO. Peter there to support and a strong team we have around the table here with all the people I mentioned here before that there is no problem. But Shaw plans for success and it works at it. And I think that as a company, we tend to deliver it. So, after that, Brad?

Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CEO-Elect   [3]

Thanks, Jim. We are excited about the future of our Company in this dynamic environment. Our core business continues to be resilient in the face of heightened competition and continues to generate significant amounts of free cash flow. We believe our ownership of content and our entry into the wireless market will grow and strengthen our portfolio of assets. They also position us to deal with and respond to the competitive realities of our marketplace and evolving consumer and technology trends that are impacting our industry

And just before we turn it over to questions, from this team around here and Jim mentioned about the strength of our team and how we manage as a collaborative approach and as a team approach, and the team is expanding. Jim will be here. J.R. will be here. We have a solid foundation for this Company to grow, and we are committed to continuing on and building in that process and what we built on to date

So we will be happy to turn it over to questions, operator

 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [2]

Thank you, operator, and thanks to everyone for joining us today to discuss our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2011

With me today are members of our senior management team, including Peter Bissonnette, President; Steve Wilson, Chief Financial Officer; Michael D'Avella, Senior Vice President of Planning; Jay Mehr, Senior Vice President of Operations, SCI; Ken Stein, Senior Vice President of Regulatory; Jean Brazeau, Senior Vice President of Regulatory; Paul Robertson, Group Vice President of Broadcasting and President of Shaw Media; and Jim Cummings, Group Vice President, Shaw Satellite Operations

This is my first opportunity to speak to our shareholders as CEO. JR started this Company in 1966, and he took enormous risks and worked tirelessly. His leadership and guidance are a constant source of inspiration to all of us

Jim took over as CEO in 1998 and continued to grow our business and create value for all of our stakeholders. He led many transformative acquisitions, and he oversaw the development of highly successful businesses such as digital phone, Internet and digital cable

The legacy and stewardship of JR and Jim provide a model and source of motivation that will guide me as I take on the leadership of Shaw

We just concluded our Board meeting and AGM, and we're pleased to announce a 5% dividend increase to an annual rate of CAD0.92 per share

Before discussing some of the highlights of our first quarter, I wanted to begin by outlining some of the key priorities that we will focus on throughout the year

Focusing on our core -- we are first and foremost a cable and satellite provider. We will stay focused on our core business and continue to provide an exceptional customer experience through both technology enhancements and differentiated customer service

The cable and satellite business continue to be highly profitable and generate significant amounts of free cash flow. The environment remains competitive, but we feel that we are well positioned to protect and grow our business

We continue to believe that we have the pricing power, and we will focus on our high-value and profitable bundle customers. We have a technology roadmap in place to ensure our core products and services continue to deliver a leading customer experience, and we believe the enterprise market in Western Canada provides attractive growth opportunities

We have committed additional resources to ensuring that we grow our market share in that area

Wireless deployment -- we remain committed to wireless and are excited about the opportunity it represents for our Company going forward. As with all of our other significant investments at Shaw, we believe it is best to take a disciplined approach

We expect to incur between CAD150 million and CAD200 million in fiscal 2011 on our wireless initiatives, and we now expect to launch these services in our first major market early in calendar year 2012, which is approximately three months later than previously anticipated

There are tremendous opportunities in wireless, and we know that the competition will be extremely fierce. Our wireless strategy will be driven by us offering a reliable and unique product at a price point that creates value for our customers. As always, we will continue to strive to provide exceptional service that our customers have become accustomed to

Shaw Media -- we are excited about the performance of our newly acquired broadcasting assets. We closed the transaction on October 27, and on a full-year basis in fiscal 2011, we expect Shaw Media's EBITDA to improve by approximately 10% over the prior year to CAD290 million and generate free cash flow of approximately CAD100 million

Integration is currently underway, and we are impressed with the quality and aptitude of the management team we have in place at Shaw Media. Our task will be to ensure Shaw Media is integrated into Shaw and that we find creative ways to enhance and build new revenue streams

Before answering any questions, we will briefly turn to our Q1 results. Including Shaw Media, our revenues increased 19% to CAD1.08 billion, and EBITDA increased 18%, excluding the CRTC Part II fee last year, to CAD473 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was CAD145 million

From the close of the acquisition, which occurred on October 27, to our quarter end on November 30, Shaw Media contributed CAD125 million in revenue, CAD58 million in EBITDA and CAD40 million to free cash flow. This business continues to outperform our expectations, and we believe we have substantial opportunities to combine distribution and content for the benefit of our customers and shareholders

Our preliminary guidance provided on Q4 call has not changed. We expect our core cable and satellite assets to generate CAD550 million of free cash flow. We expect our media assets to contribute CAD50 million for the 10-month period, bringing our consolidated free cash flow figure to approximately CAD600 million

We have an experienced management team in place to help guide our 13,000 talented and motivated employees. We all recognize the challenges that we face with respect to the competitive environment, but we are also excited about the year ahead and the future of Shaw. Shaw will continue to lead and innovate within our industry and ensure that we remain a leading entertainment communications company in Canada

Before we open the line for questioning, I would now like to turn it over to our CFO, Steve Wilson, who is going to provide some more detail regarding the financial results for Shaw Media. Steve?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc. - SVP and CFO   [3]

Thanks, Brad. We thought it would be helpful to have a more fulsome discussion on the Shaw Media results, which may answer some of the questions that you have and assist with your modeling going forward

Shaw Media's performance has been strong since we originally announced that we had entered into agreements to purchase 100% of Canwest's broadcasting assets last May. For the one-month period since we closed the acquisition on October 27, the assets generated almost CAD60 million in EBITDA and CAD40 million in free cash flow

For informational purposes and clarity surrounding the financial performance, we wanted to provide some additional detail and commentary regarding the results for the quarter ending November 30. For the three-month period, Shaw Media generated almost CAD310 million in revenue and CAD130 million in consolidated EBITDA. This represents an increase in revenue of 8%. And EBITDA, excluding the impact of the one-time Part II fee recovery, improved by 19% compared to the first quarter in 2010

Shaw Media free cash flow after consideration of CRTC benefit obligations and minority interest for the first quarter was CAD85 million. Although we reported CAD40 million in free cash flow in our Q1 results for the one-month period, it's very important to point out that the cash flows generated by the broadcasting assets since we announced the acquisition in May have all accrued to the benefit of Shaw. And in fact, on closing, there was over CAD80 million of cash at the closing balance sheet

The broadcasting business obviously has some seasonality compared to our core and cable satellite assets. The seasonality is mainly attributable to the cyclicality in advertising sales that occurred within the broadcasting industry throughout the year. The first quarter is typically the strongest due to the fall season, which includes the largest period of advertising sales and campaigns and the launch of new programming schedules, while Q4 is typically the weakest due to lower summer viewership audiences and repeat programming schedules

Shaw Media's first-quarter EBITDA margin exceeded 40%, and we expect the margins to normalize throughout the year and to be between 26% and 30% on a full-year basis

As stated in our press release, we expect Shaw Media's 12-month consolidated EBITDA to improve by 10% to CAD290 million and free cash flow for fiscal 2011 to be approximately CAD100 million. This free cash flow amount once again is after taking into account CAD30 million of CRTC benefit obligations as well as CAD28 million of minority interest

Besides seasonality in the broadcasting industry impacting quarterly revenue and EBITDA results, the capital expenditures and CRTC benefit obligations were not material in Q1, and we expect these expenditures to increase throughout the remainder of the year

Our guidance regarding Shaw Media free cash flow contribution for the 10-month period of CADD50 million takes this into account

As we previously stated, we are excited about the acquisition from both a financial and strategic perspective. Based on an investment of CAD2 billion, the pro forma transaction multiple on expected consolidated 2011 EBITDA is less than 7 times. Also, for the entire year, Shaw Media (technical difficulty) consolidated free cash flow by almost 20%

As Brad stated earlier on the call, we believe there are many opportunities ahead to enhance and build new revenue streams through the integration of content and distribution

I'll turn it back to Brad

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications, Inc. - CEO   [2]

Thank you, operator, and thanks to everyone for joining us today to discuss our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2011

With me today are members of our senior management team, including Peter Bissonnette, President; Steve Wilson, Chief Financial Officer; Michael D'Avella, Senior Vice President of Planning; Jay Mehr, Senior Vice President of Operations; Ken Stein, Senior Vice President of Regulatory; Jean Brazeau, Senior Vice President of Regulatory; Paul Robinson, President of Shaw Media and Jim Cummins, Shaw Satellite Operations

Before we take your questions on the quarter, I wanted to make a few brief remarks on some of the recent developments at Shaw. Over the last several years, we have grown substantially. We have added [almost] 1.2 million residential phone customers. Our Internet penetration is now at 80% and our Digital TV customer base has experienced significant growth since the beginning of fiscal 2009. We are now approaching our goal of 80% visual penetration by the end of this year

During this time of growth, our industry has experienced dramatic change. Technology and consumer preferences are evolving and the competitive environment has converged and intensified. Our organization has adapted and prospered during recent years

We continue to believe that following the acquisition of Shaw Media there remains substantial opportunities to combine distribution and content for the benefit of our customers and our shareholders. We believe that our portfolio of assets cements our status as one of the leading entertainment and communications companies in Canada and that we are well-positioned in a highly competitive environment

We have recently taken steps to realign our business to take into account the competitive realities of our industry. Our recently announced restructuring of approximately 550 employees was a difficult decision. But we feel it is necessary to streamline our organization and continue our track record of superior operational focus and execution

These initiatives which were mainly focused on management efficiencies will result in over CAD50 million of annual savings and will not impact our focus on an exceptional customer experience. Our subscribers' results to date this year reflect the maturity of our products and the impact of the competitive environment

However, we remain confident that we can achieve our financial targets previously disclosed including the CAD600 million of free cash flow in fiscal 2011. Recently we rolled out new packaging options for our customers, which provide choice and flexibility. The Shaw Plan Personalizer enables our customers to customize their home entertainment services by choosing features they value and want. It uses our Internet Extreme product as the anchor of the residential bundle and the Plan Personalizer is the tool that we (technical difficulty) use to create everyday value for our customers

We have also launched an attractive option for our customers to secure hardware, including HD PVRs through our Shaw Easy Own plan. This enables our customers to amortize their cost of equipment over 36 months timeframe and protects our capital investment through an implied contract

Although innovative products and services will continue in the upcoming quarter, the Shaw Gateway Box will be launched in May and represents a premium entertainment experience that enables IP-based content, whole home PVR solution and an advanced user interface

The dynamics within the wireless industry continue to evolve at a rapid pace and we believe all options need to be carefully considered in advance of the launch of a wireless service. We announced today that we are adjusting our wireless build activities as we evaluate technology, including LTE options and strategic alternatives with respect to our wireless initiatives

Our strategy has always been focused on providing a wireless service that creates compelling value for both our customers and our shareholders. And therefore, we believe we should allow some of the uncertainties, including technology developments within the industry, to become clear before we move forward and articulate our wireless plans

While we continue our wireless strategic review, we will continue to focus on the strength of our core business and we tend to make important investments in new technology platforms, digital reclamation and broadband capacity initiatives. These expenditures will ensure that our services remain best in class. We believe we have an opportunity to expand, evolve, and position our broadband service as the product that is truly differentiated and to create an Internet experience for our customers that is difficult for our competitors to replicate

Over the last quarter, we continued our focus on the business market across Western Canada. We have the ability to deliver a new experience for our business customers through innovative solutions. This includes IP-based voice and data services through our substantial fiber and coaxial infrastructure that already exists. Additional investments will be made to grow and capitalize on these opportunities, including new service development, strategic fiber builds and increased capacity

Over the next month, we will be launching hosted PBX solution in Calgary and Ethernet over DOCSIS in all major markets. The benefits for previously investments in DOCSIS 3.0 will enable us to aggressively market our [warp and natural] products to our business customers. Expanding our business initiatives represents attractive incremental margin opportunities for our organization

Shaw has a proven track record of prudently managing capital and managing the financially sound investments for all of our stakeholders. Our industry is evolving at a rapid pace and competition has intensified

We are confident we are making the right operational, strategic and capital decisions that continue to position our Company as a leading entertainment and communications company in Canada. We all recognize the challenges that we face with respect to the competitive environment, evolving consumer preferences, and the technology developments; but we are also excited about the possibilities that truly exist for Shaw

Thanks to everyone for joining us today and we would now like to open the phones to answer your questions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [2]

Thank you, Operator, and thanks to everyone for joining us today to discuss our results for the third quarter. With me today are members of our senior management team including Peter Bissonnette, President; Steve Wilson, Chief Financial Officer; Michael D'Avella, Senior Vice President of Planning; Jay Mehr, Senior Vice President of Operations; Ken Stein, Senior Vice President of Regulatory; Jean Brazeau, Senior Vice President of Regulatory; Paul Robertson, President, Shaw Media; and Jim Cummins, Group Vice President, Shaw Satellite Operations

Let me start by saying we are very pleased with our Q3 results which reflect an improvement over the second quarter and incorporate cost savings that resulted from actions we announced and undertook at the end of March to streamline our business. We remain focused on continuous innovation and product leadership to enhance the customer experience, and I will touch on the success we're having with our new packages, offers, and products that we have recently introduced

Our subscriber results this quarter stabilized and reflect the impact of a competitive environment. However, core cable and satellite EBITDA increased 7% compared to Q2, and we remain confident that we will achieve our financial targets previously disclosed, including CAD600 million of consolidated free cash flow in fiscal 2011

An intense competitive environment is the reality of our industry, and we are committed to confronting the competitive landscape through leadership and innovation in our products and delivering an unprecedented customer experience. Our focus is on owning the home and by providing our customers with greater choice, transparency, flexibility, technology options and a superior broadband service, we will deliver at compelling value proposition for our package of services

The Shaw Plan Personalizer, launched in March, enables our customers to customize their own entertainment services by choosing the features they want and value. This package utilizes our DOCSIS 3.0 internet services as the anchor of the residential bundle and the Plan Personalizer is the tool that we're using to create everyday value for our customers, as opposed to engaging in costly and dilutive promotional activities. This tool has been effective since its launch, and we are experiencing an upward migration of customers into higher internet service levels, and an increase in HD penetration of channels. The Plan Personalizer has also had an overall positive impact on operating margins. We also increased the speed of our Extreme Internet Service from 15 megabytes to 20 megabytes during the quarter. This was the first step towards an unveiling of our new internet service offerings that are focused on broadband leadership within the customer's home

In May, the Shaw Gateway Box was launched in Calgary, and we are now rolling out the product in Edmonton and other major markets will follow later this summer. We are excited to take a leadership position by being the first significant North American MSO to launch our hybrid technology, which brings together the power of DOCSIS3.0 broadband in our superior High Definition technologies to deliver the best of both worlds. The Gateway represents a premium entertainment experience that enables six simultaneous HD streams in the home, IP-based content, a whole-home PVR solution and a powerful user interface

In June, we announced new internet packages that provide more choice and flexibility. After engaging in consultation sessions with our customers through 34 sessions across Canada, we are providing new packages that strategically utilize our bandwidth advantage and investments in DOCSIS3.0 to deliver speeds that are not easily replicated by our competitors. Our base internet product is now 50 megabytes, serviced with 400 gigabyte of capacity available in the Triple Play bundle. We plan to undergo a major upgrade of our network by converting analog tiers to digital which will triple our internet capacity. We will have packages that will meet the demands of all our customer segments, including high-end users with speeds of up to 250 megabits and unlimited data plans are available once the digital migration initiatives are complete. We believe these offers and investments in our network will further cement our status as a broadband provider of choice across our operating footprint

We continue to see momentum building in our business services with strong growth in all products. As mentioned previously, we have expanded our voice portfolio with hosted PBX and are committed to providing competitive solutions for our customers looking to replace a very old legacy phone system. Building on the broadband leadership initiatives, we have expanded our business portfolio with the introduction of 25, 50 and 100 megabit services. And with the growth of cloud-based and multi-tiered applications for business, we continue to see strong demand for symmetric data services, like our recently-introduced Metro Ethernet product as a replacement for legacy DSL circuits. The business market represents a tremendous opportunity for us going forward

Shaw Media continues to perform exceptionally well and we expect results for our 2011 will exceed our previously disclosed EBITDA and free cash flow guidance. Our team recently returned from US studio screenings where we were able to secure key programming for our fiscal 2012 schedule as well as all the necessary digital rights to leverage our content across multiple platforms

On our last conference call, we announced we are putting our wireless build initiatives on hold and that we are embarking on a strategic review process of the wireless opportunity. The review is ongoing, and as we continue to evaluate technology, including LTE options, and other strategic alternatives with respect to our wireless plans. We are making good progress; however, we have no additional details to disclose at this time. We expect to be in a position to announce our wireless strategy over the summer as we continue to evaluate all options

We are very optimistic that the new developments in products that we have recently launched will help us build a stronger relationship with our customers. Our focus is on the core business, and we will continue to launch innovative products and packages, and deliver an exceptional customer experience. Thanks to everyone for joining us today, and we would now like to open the phones to any of your questions

 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [2]

Thank you, operator, and thanks to everyone for joining us today to discuss our fourth-quarter and year-end results. With me today are members of our senior management team, including Peter Bissonnette, President; Steve Wilson, Chief Financial Officer; Jay Mehr, Senior Vice President of Operations; Jean Brazeau, Senior Vice President of Regulatory; Michael D'Avella, Senior Vice President of Planning; Paul Robertson, President, Shaw Media; and Jim Cummins, Group Vice President, Shaw Satellite Operations

Fiscal 2011 was an exciting year at Shaw, as we implemented a number of strategic initiatives that were focused on providing our customers choice, flexibility, and transparency, as well as the latest in technological advancements. We launched a number of innovative products and services including the Shaw Plan Personalizer, the Shaw Gateway, and we introduced higher Internet speeds and data-usage allowances for our broadband customers. We have begun the reclamation of our digital tiers, which will triple our Internet capacity. In an environment where customers are demanding higher speeds and are utilizing data-intensive applications, we believe our service is truly unique versus competitive alternatives

During the year, we completed the integration of our media assets, and the business has proven to be a key strategic asset and a financially accretive acquisition. The division performed extremely well in fiscal 2011, as our leading portfolio of specialty channels and conventional programming benefited from the recovery in the advertising market. Based on our CAD2 billion purchase and the 12-month financial performance of Shaw Media for the period ending August 31, 2011, the transaction multiple represents only 6.1 times consolidated EBITDA and reinforces the financial benefits of the acquisition, which closed a year ago. Shaw is a dynamic Company, a successful operator, a technology leader, and we have a proven track record of making sound financial investments for all of our stakeholders. Our decision to not pursue a conventional wireless business is consistent with our strategic DNA

In September, we announced our plans to build a managed Wi-Fi network to extend our customers broadband experience beyond their homes. Customers are actively seeking Wi-Fi hotspots to reduce data costs and improve their wireless broadband experience. Shaw will become the first service provider in Canada to deliver reliable, wireless broadband through an extensive, carrier-grade Wi-Fi network covering thousands of locations. As we face the realities of the competitive environment within our industry, we are focused on profitability, and we are very pleased to report that we delivered on our fiscal 2011 guidance

During the year, we renewed our focus on operational efficiencies and implemented restructuring initiatives. Consolidated EBITDA, including the 10 months' contribution from the media assets, exceeded CAD2 billion, And excluding the impact of the CRTC Part II decision in fiscal 2010, our cable EBITDA increased by over 6% to almost CAD1.5 billion. Our cable margin for the year exceeded 48%, and in the fourth quarter, our margin was one of the highest on record, whereby we achieved a cable margin in excess of 50%. Shaw Media had an exceptional year, and on a 12-month basis, revenue increased 7%

EBITDA increased 25% to CAD325 million, and free cash flow from the division was approximately CAD145 million for the year ending August 31. Consolidated free cash flow for fiscal 2011, which includes 10 months of the media results, was over CAD600 million, despite a CAD60 million increase in cash taxes and the acceleration of certain capital investments in the fourth quarter. The accelerated investments relate mostly to our digital network upgrade, as well as deposit on the new Anik G1 satellite, which is set to launch towards the end of 2012

The initiatives we undertook this year, the decisions we executed on, have us well-positioned to move forward in this rapidly evolving landscape. We are starting the new fiscal year with a number of strategic initiatives on the agenda, including our digital network upgrade and our Wi-Fi build. We expect continued growth in revenue and EBITDA across all divisions in 2012. Investments in our various strategic priorities are expected to increase capital within our cable business, and combined with a higher CRTC benefit obligation funding and cash taxes, we expect free cash flow to climb moderately to approximately CAD550 million

We look forward to the challenges and opportunities ahead. We have the assets, resources, and the creativity, and the drive to successfully execute on our fiscal 2012 strategic plans. We believe we are well positioned to create value for all our stakeholders in 2012 and beyond. Thanks to everyone for joining us today, and we would now open the phones to answer any questions

Welcome to Shaw Communications' Fiscal 2012 First Quarter Conference Call. Today's call will be hosted by Mr. Brad Shaw, CEO of Shaw Communications.

 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [2]

Thank you, Operator. Thanks to everyone for joining us today to discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2012. With me today are members of the senior management team including Peter Bissonnette, President, Steve Wilson, Chief Financial Officer, Jay Mehr, Senior Vice President of Operations, Jean Brazeau, Senior Vice President of Regulatory, Michael D'Avella, Senior Vice President of Planning, Paul Robertson, President of Shaw Media, and Jim Cummins, Group Vice President, Shaw Satellite Operations

Another fiscal year is underway and we are extremely proud of the fact that 2012 marks a significant milestone in Shaw's history. As we are celebrating 40 years of growth and success in Canada, we have a superb leadership team and a tradition of employee commitment and engagement that resonates throughout our organization. The Shaw team of over 13,000 employees drives and delivers results for all of our stakeholders. Our goal this year is to continue our history and our track record of delivering exceptional products and service to our 3.1 million customers across the country and to create value for our shareholders. Fiscal 2012 is off to a good start, as first quarter financial results were solid and we generated almost CAD120 million in free cash flow

Recently, there has been some concern regarding our approach to the competitive environment. Promotional activity has been a reality in our business for a number of years and has been embedded in our financial results. In the past, a lot of our promotional activity has been tactical and not necessarily in the public or media spotlight. Beginning in the latter part of 2011, we embarked on a strategy that entailed more mass marketing of some of our offers. This does not represent a doubling down of the promotional activity, as we have simply shifted some of our tactics towards our promotional efforts

We remain focused on balancing subscriber results and profitability and continuing to maintain our industry-leading margin performance. Over the years, we have made a number of strategic decisions that have positioned our Company with a strong portfolio of assets. We are well-situated both from a strategic and financial perspective to compete and grow our business. Our assets continue to yield solid financial results and generate substantial amounts of free cash flow and today we confirmed our fiscal 2012 guidance. We expect continued growth in revenue and EBITDA across all of our divisions, and due to some strategic investments during the year, it is expected that capital will increase compared to 2011 levels. Considering this and other factors, including higher CRTC benefit obligations, free cash flow for the year is estimated to be approximately CAD550 million

We just concluded our Board Meeting and AGM and we are pleased to announce a 5% dividend increase to an annual rate of CAD0.97 per share. The higher dividend rate becomes effective at the beginning of Q3 and total dividend payments for fiscal 2012 are expected to be approximately CAD415 million. We continue to focus on the execution of our strategic initiatives that we announced last year. Our digital network upgrade is well underway, with over 50% of our customers now converted. The reclamation of the additional bandwidth will provide us with the ability to triple our Internet speeds and create capacity to offer substantial increases in HD and VOD services. We continue to evolve our products and service offerings with enhancement that are geared towards improving flexibility, transparency and value for our customers. This includes the Shaw Plan Personalizer, Easy Own hardware options, and our broadband leadership

During the quarter, we also announced our partnership with Motorola regarding our new DreamGallery guide. This improved interface is expected to be launched in the Spring of 2012. We launched our Wi-Fi trial on December 6 in Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver and we continue to add sites. We continue to believe that Wi-Fi will extend the value proposition of our customers' Internet services beyond the home and will reinforce our broadband leadership position. We remain bullish on our goal to expand Shaw products and services within the business market across Western Canada and this will continue to be a priority and focus for our Company going forward. Our recent announcement regarding the City of Calgary contract is an example of the substantial opportunities that exist within this market and we look forward to winning some of the incumbent's market share

In closing, I wanted to reaffirm that our entire organization is focused on execution of our strategic initiatives and our business plan for the upcoming year. We all recognize the challenges that we face with respect to the competitive environment, but we are also excited about the year ahead and the future of Shaw. Our innovation, spirit, and drive will ensure that we capture the best of what the future has to offer for our customers, our employees, and our shareholders. Thanks to everyone for joining us today and we'd now like to open the phones to answer any questions

 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [2]

Thank you, Operator, and thanks to everyone for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results and fiscal 2012. With me today are members of the senior management team including Peter Bissonnette, President; Steve Wilson, Chief Financial Officer; Jay Mehr, Senior Vice President of Operations; Jean Brazeau, Senior Vice President of Regulatory; Michael D' Avella, Senior Vice President of Planning; Paul Robertson, President of Shaw Media; and Jim Cummins, Group Vice President Shaw Satellite Operations

Earlier this morning we released our Q2 results and we will spend some time discussing our subscriber and financial performance this quarter, but before we begin I want to provide an update on some of our strategic priorities that we have discussed in the past. In the last 40 years we have made significant investments to create one of the leading entertainment and communications companies in Canada and Shaw's experienced tremendous growth and success over the history of our organization; however, as our industry matures, cable, telecom and broadcasting entities are challenged to find ways to grow and differentiate their services. We believe that our overall strategy is the correct course of action and that we are continuing to invest capital and focus on operational resources and strategic initiatives that solidify Shaw's position in the competitive environment. Our DNU activities continued throughout the quarter and the reclamation of the analog tiers will enable us to offer our customers unmatched internet speeds and a greater selection of HD and VOD services. Our Wi-Fi network continues to be constructed and earlier this year we launched our Shaw XO Wi-Fi Finder app. We will continue to focus on scaling the network and this remains a priority for us in fiscal '12 and '13

As of technology, Wi-Fi is gathering a lot of attention regarding its role within the broadband and wireless ecosystems. We believe it will further differentiate our broadband experience and increase the value proposition of our internet services. I also want to reaffirm that based on the governments announcement on March 14 regarding the 700 megahertz option, we continue to review the economics of the traditional wireless network as unattractive and have no intention of building such infrastructure. We continue to focus on opportunities within the business market in western Canada. During the quarter, we announced contracts with BC Biomedical Laboratories, Husky's Energy Sunrise Project in the City of Calgary

Last week we announced the strategic marketing agreement with Xplornet that will enable us to offer a bundle of services to our Shaw direct customers. Over time, we believe this partnership will help grow our [BPH] business and improve the financial performance of our satellite assets. Over the years, Shaw Communications has consistently delivered strong customer results and industry-leading financial metrics. We have faced competitive pressures from IPTV threats for a number of years; however, 2011 was the first year we actually lost cable subscribers. Our major Telco competitor has rolled out their IPTV product across the majority of our cable footprint in western Canada and continues to employ an aggressive market share strategy. This strategy is predominantly focused on heavily subsidized equipment and promotional offers aimed directly at our video customer base

On our last conference call we discussed a change in our tactics regarding our approach to the competitive environment. Throughout the quarter we initiated a variety of packages and offers and the results of these subscriber acquisition strategies are evident in our Q2 results. During the quarter we added over 60,000 core RGUs compared to 11,000 in Q1 and 30,000 a year ago. Our basic subscriber loss has moderated to less than 10,000 this quarter compared to a loss of 23,000 three months ago. This approach to the competitive environment, including costs associated with staffing, marketing expenditures, and the impact of our subscriber activity over the last quarter has caused financial results to come under pressure. We view the majority of these expenditures as core investments that provide long-term benefits for our Company, but we do not anticipate that our cable operating cost structure to be reflective of the Q2 run rate of CAD450 million going forward

The core of our strategy has always been customer service and our operations are now fully staffed, including the three additional locations in Calgary, Vancouver and Edmonton in December. Call center staff have undergone additional training and have the ability to perform inbound and outbound calling which will help us manage peak periods of call volume activity. We continue to develop more online self-serve functionality as another avenue for our customers to reach us. We believe that the majority of our customer service issues are behind us and the re-establishing our reputation as a customer service-focused organization is of utmost importance to us. These customer service investments were necessary and I understand and acknowledge the importance of delivering an exceptional customer experience

I began my career at Shaw over 20 years ago in customer service and exceeding the demands of our customers has always been and will continue to be the foundation to our future success. The value of an effective marketing campaign program and creating brand awareness and recognition is becoming increasingly important. We are excited about the launch of our newly branded network, the XL Network, as we believe we have an opportunity to reconfirm our technology leadership position to the market and create additional brand awareness with the existing and new customers. Our branding and marketing efforts will be lead by Chief Marketing Officer, Jim Little, who will be joining the Shaw team at the end of April. We look forward to his contribution as he brings a wealth of knowledge and has held senior marketing positions with several leading Canadian organizations

We are focused on customer profitability and sustainable growth initiatives and we are not satisfied with this quarters financial performance. We expect cable margins and free cash flow to improve in the second half of 2012 but considering the rapidly evolving dynamics within our business and our financial results to date, we announced today that we have revised our consolidated fiscal 2012 free cash flow guidance to CAD450 million. We also announced that we anticipate a marginal decline in cable operating income before amortization year over year, modest growth in satellite and consistent year-over-year operating income and media. The competitive environment that we operate in is not predictable and there is risk to this guidance

For the remainder of 2012 we will continue to push ahead with our strategic initiatives and focus on sustainable growth. The full effects of the recent subscriber activity were not entirely reflected in our Q2 cable revenue results and, therefore, some revenue pressure will continue; however, we do not expect that our cable cost structure will moderate going forward. Although we anticipate continued RGU growth for the remainder of the year, we intend to be more disciplined and prudent. We remain confident about the long-term profitability and free cash flow profile of our consolidated business, and we believe we are taking appropriate course of action to protect and grow our subscriber base, leverage our network to accommodate new technology and provide an exceptional customer experience. Thanks to everyone for joining us today and we would now like to open the phones to answer any questions

 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [2]

Thank you, operator. And thanks to everyone for joining us today to discuss our third-quarter results for fiscal 2012. With me today are members of the senior management team, including Peter Bissonnette, President; Steve Wilson, Chief Financial Officer; Jay Mehr, Senior Vice President of Operations; Jean Brazeau, Senior Vice President of Regulatory; Michael D'Avella, Senior Vice President of Planning; Paul Robertson, President - Shaw Media, and Jim Cummins, Group Vice President - Shaw Satellite Operations

Earlier today, we released our Q3 results, and I'll make some brief remarks before we open the call for questions. We believe the results are consistent with the messages we delivered back in April. During the quarter, we focused on discipline, sustainable and profitable customer initiatives, and our Q3 financial performance reflects improvements in line with our strategic approach regarding operational activities. We delivered on our commitment to reduce our cable cost structure, and our cable EBITDA margin for the three-month period improved by 370 basis points to 47.5%, compared to a quarter ago. Our free cash flow was over CAD200 million in Q3, and year-to-date free cash flow from our consolidated assets totals almost CAD380 million

We continue to make good progress on our strategic priorities and investments, including our Wi-Fi and DNU projects. Our network is a strategic and differentiated advantage, and we continue to make the necessary investments to ensure that this position of leadership is maintained and enhanced. Our broadband product is superior to competitive alternatives, and this represents the foundation for our future success within our residential consumer business. Wi-Fi continues to gain attention and credibility regarding its role within the wireless broadband ecosystem, and we are pleased with the results of our network at this stage of the build

Going forward, as additional scale is created, we will begin to actively market this additional Wi-Fi service to Shaw customers. Our improved user interface, DreamGallery, is currently being tested in two markets and this will be widely deployed by the end of this year. This software is backwards-compatible with approximately 700,000 boxes we currently have deployed across our footprint. We believe this new and modern approach to our guide will be embraced by a large number of our existing customers

Our media business continues to be resilient, even as the advertising market remains weak. Our portfolio of specialty channels continues to outperform, and our media team has done an exceptional job in proactively reducing costs. Shaw Direct continued to generate attractive amounts of free cash flow, and we recently have announced a strategic partnership with Xplorenet, and a new VOD service utilizing adaptive streaming technology. Both of these should create incremental revenue opportunities going forward. Our activities are focused on improving the long-term profitability of our assets and we will continue to implement cost savings, execute on operational efficiencies, and prudently manage our capital investments. We remain confident about the free cash profile of our consolidated assets, and we believe our operating focus is the right strategy to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today and operator, you can open up the phone for questions, please

 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CEO-Elect   [2]

Thank you, Operator, and thanks to everyone for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and year-end results for fiscal 2012. With me today are members of our Senior Management team including Peter Bissonnette, President; Steve Wilson, Chief Financial Officer; Jay Mehr, Senior Vice President of Operations; Jean Brazeau, Senior Vice President of Regulatory; Michael D'Avella, Senior Vice President of Planning; Paul Robertson, President Shaw Media; Jim Cummins, Group Vice President Shaw Satellite Operations. Earlier today we released our Q4 and fiscal 2012 results, and I'll make some brief remarks before we open up the call for questions

We are pleased with our performance this quarter as we exited 2012 with a more balanced and sustainable approach to the operating environment in Western Canada. We remain focused on strengthening our core business and infrastructure advantage. Our initiatives are delivering greater value to our subscribers through excellent customer service. We have employed more rigor and discipline to our pricing, customer acquisition strategies, and our marketing activities. This strategy was evident in our financial results during the second half of the year and this will continue to be our focus in fiscal 2013

In Q4, consolidated revenues improved 3%, EBITDA increased by 4%, and free cash flow was in excess of CAD100 million. Our cable margin improved by 180 basis points to over 49% compared to three months ago, and free cash flow for the year was CAD482 million. We recognize that our Company succeeds because of the foundation created by our powerful network and our caring and committed people. We continue to make significant investments in both. Delivering exceptional customer experience -- experiences will remain a key priority for all of our operations

We have made substantial investments to ensure our service capabilities and capacity will remain at a high level. Specifically, we have added staff, developed tools to enhance service, and dramatically reduced call waiting times. We are leveraging our leading edge network, rolling out a number of new products and services this year to deliver innovation, choice, enhance value to our customers and viewers. We continue to expand our WiFi network footprint, and our digital network upgrade project remains on track as we expect to complete the digitization of our analog tiers in 2013

We recently announced the first phase of our TV Everywhere strategy with a successful launch of our Shaw Go Movie Central and Shaw Go NFL Sunday Ticket apps. We are introducing our new guide which utilizes Motorola's DreamGallery software this fall. We believe our customers will embrace this flexible, modern, intuitive interface that improves overall customer experience of our video product. Our media business continues to be strong. Even as the advertising market remains challenging, Q4 results, revenue, and EBITDA were up compared to a year ago. Overall the team did a tremendous job of managing our cost structure in a difficult business environment as EBITDA in 2012 was higher by 2% compared to a year ago. To date, we have had a strong response to our fall lineup and our portfolio of specialty channels continues to be form

We have a number of initiatives under way at Shaw Direct, including the introduction of an additional 200 HD channels following the launch of Anik G1. Unfortunately, the introduction of these new services has been delayed due to an unrelated rocket failure and we now expect the new satellite to be in service by the spring. Our activities are focused on improving the long-term profitability of our assets and we will continue to implement cost savings, execute on operational efficiencies, and prudently manage our capital investments while delivering exceptional customer experiences. We remain confident about the free cash flow profile of our consolidated assets, and we believe our operating focus is the right strategy to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders

In fiscal 2013, we expect growth in the consolidated revenue and EBITDA, capital investment is expected to marginally decline from 2012 spend levels as we continue with a number of our strategic initiatives, including DNU, WiFi, and the launch of Anik G1. Taking into consideration this continued capital investment along with higher cash taxes, we expect fiscal 2013 free cash flow to be comparable to last year's amount

I want to close with a comment about Shaw being named among Canada's top 100 employers earlier this month. We are very proud of the people and the work they do for us every single day. This recognition reflects our people's confidence in our Company and the passion that all of them bring to work is the foundation for Shaw's success. I want to take this opportunity to thank them for their commitment. Thanks to everyone for joining us today, and we'd now like to open the phone to answer any questions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [2]

Thank you operator, and thanks to everyone for joining us today to discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2013. With me today, are members of our senior management team including Peter Bissonnette, President, Steve Wilson, Chief Financial Officer, Jay Mehr, Senior Vice President of Operations, Jean Brazeau, Senior Vice President of Regulatory, Michael D'Avella, Senior Vice President of Planning, Paul Robertson, President Shaw Media, and Jim Cummins, Group Vice President, Shaw Satellite Operations. Earlier today, we held our annual general meeting, and released our Q1 results. I'll make some brief remarks before we open up the call for questions

Our performance this quarter reflects the efforts made have toward enhancing our customer service capacity, expanding our technology and infrastructure advantage, and maintaining price and financial discipline. We have seen a gradual and steady return in the market to a more disciplined and sustainable approach to pricing and promotional officers. Building on the momentum from our second half of last year, we delivered strong first quarter financial results. Cable, even in the quarter, was up 5% compared to a year ago. And our Q1 margin of almost 49% reflects the continued balance of customer profitability and growth in subscription revenue

Our consolidated business generated free cash flow of almost CAD245 million this quarter, and we are pleased to announce that our Board today approved a 5% dividend increase that is effective at the beginning of May. This continues our track record of returning capital to shareholders, and reinforces management and our Board's confidence in the long-term free cash flow profile of our assets

Since the beginning of fiscal 2013, we have been focused on improving our business for our customers and viewers. We have responded to our customers' demands for greater content, connectivity, and convenience, while maintaining a leadership position in a highly competitive market. During the quarter, we launched a bold new brand and marketing platform in a series of initiatives that transform the customer experience, bringing TV into the Internet era with innovations like Shaw-On-Demand search app, the Shaw Gold Movie Central, and NFL Sunday Ticket apps, and our new HD guide

We continued to expand our WiFi network footprint complimenting the rapid re-growing demand for broadband. Today, the trial of a Shaw Gold WiFi continues across Western Canada, with thousands of access points available to customers as part of their Internet service. Recently, we reached agreements with the municipalities in Winnipeg and Victoria to extend coverage to key public venues in those cities

Our digital network upgrade project continues to build network capacity, enabling us to deliver new channels, more HD television and faster internet speeds. We remain on track to complete the upgrade of our analogue tiers to digital in 2013

Our media business continues to be strong, and our mid season lineup of global TV looks to build on the momentum generated by our successful Fall season. This success is reflected in media's financial results as revenue and EBITDA were up 7% and 9% respectively in Q1. Our satellite business at Shaw Direct remains solid, and we are making preparations to become the HD leader in Canada with over 200 HD channels becoming available following the launch of Anik G1 later this year. But we aren't resting on these plans and achievements. We are building our business for the future, working hard to strengthen our advantages, and capitalize on opportunities. We remain confident about the free cash flow profile of our consolidated assets, and we will keep our operating focus sharp

As I told shareholders at our AGM, we believe our continued success will depend on the execution of four priorities. First, we will deliver exceptional customer and viewer experiences. Second, we will continue to leverage our leading technology as a competitive advantage across all our businesses. Third, we will find ways to maintain and grow customer profitability. And finally, we will continue to identify and realize operational efficiencies

Our confidence in our ability to generate long-term shareholder value is rooted in our strong management team and employees, who genuinely care about delivering exceptional experiences for our customers and viewers. I want to thank everyone on the Shaw team for their effort and commitment. Our people, customers, and viewers are the key to our long-term success

I want to conclude my prepared remarks this afternoon by addressing the recent announcement regarding the Supreme Court of Canada's decision denying accretion of a value for signal regime. As a key player in this process, we strongly advocated for the outcome that was reached, and we believe the court's ruling is good for consumers and will be beneficial for the overall system. It is a complex decision and we are still reviewing it to consider how it may impact the industry in matters of economic regulation

Thanks to everyone for joining us today, and we would now like to open the phones to answer any questions

 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [2]

Good afternoon. Thank you, operator, and thanks to everyone for joining us today to discuss our second-quarter results for fiscal 2013. With me today are members of our senior management team including Peter Bissonnette, President; Steve Wilson, Chief Financial Officer; Jay Mehr, Senior Vice President of Operations; Jean Brazeau, Senior Vice President of Regulatory; and Michael D'Avella, Senior Vice President of Planning

Earlier today, we released our Q2 results, and I'll begin with some brief remarks regarding our performance before we discuss some of the details regarding the strategic transactions that we've announced over the last few months. We're pleased with this quarter's results, as we leverage the underlying strength across our Business to generate sustainable and profitable growth. We remain focused on providing exceptional customer experiences by taking advantage of our leading network infrastructure and high-quality content to enhance and expand our innovative offerings

The operating environment in Western Canada, including pricing dynamics, continues to improve, and we remain confident in the value proposition that we are providing to our customers. Our strategy is to balance financial results while maintaining overall Revenue Generating Units. The Cable and Satellite divisions have over 6.3 million RGUs, which represents the number of products sold to our customers. During the quarter, overall RGUs declined marginally by approximately 8,000. Video RGUs declined more than expected, as we reduced promotions and maintained tight discipline on customer equipment offers. This is reflected in our lower success-based capital this quarter

The operating environment requires us to be flexible on how we market our services to new and existing customers. Going forward, we intend to focus more on providing equipment to customers, while refraining from overly promotional pricing. We plan to offer equipment contracts as an alternative for customers, and these packaging options will be introduced later in the Spring. We believe this is a natural extension of our strategic approach to the operating environment, which is focused on profitable and sustainable customer acquisition and retention initiatives. We believe this additional choice will be embraced by certain customer segments and, therefore, we expect success-based spending will increase in the second half of the year

In Q2, we generated consolidated revenue and [EBITDA] growth of 2% and 9% to CAD1.3 billion and CAD538 million, respectively. During the quarter, we generated over CAD160 million in free cash flow, bringing our year-to-date amount to CAD405 million. The strength of our operations in the first half of the year has led us to increase our free cash flow guidance for fiscal 2013 to approximately CAD550 million. Our revised guidance takes into account our operating plan for the remainder of the year, as well as the impact of a series of transactions we recently announced; however, our free cash flow guidance excludes accelerated capital investments that we are funding from disposition proceeds. We believe it is important to provide disclosure that segments capital investments that are being funded via operations versus disposition proceeds

Over the past few months, we have announced several strategic transactions that we believe have optimized our portfolio. We divested non-core assets at attractive valuations that enhanced our financial flexibility without significantly changing the operating profile of our Company. These transactions demonstrate the ability of our leadership team to create value and sustainable long-term growth for our shareholders. On January 14, we announced a series of transactions with Rogers. We sold our Hamilton cable system for CAD400 million, which is a 30% premium over our initial purchase price in 2009, and represents a 10 times EBITDA transaction multiple. This transaction has received CRTC and Competition Bureau approvals, and we expect the sale to close at the end of the month. We also granted Rogers an option to acquire our AWS spectrum for CAD50 million, and we purchased Rogers's remaining stake in TVtropolis for CAD59 million

On March 4, we announced an asset swap with Corus that resulted in Corus acquiring our 49% interest in ABC Spark, and our 50% non-operating interest in the French language specialty channels, Historia and Series+. In return, we will acquire Corus's 20% interest in the Food Network, and receive approximately CAD95 million in cash. The transaction rationalizes our specialty portfolio, and focuses on our strengths within certain genres. Historia and Series+ are subject to CRTC approval, but we expect to close ABC Spark and the Food Network transactions by the end of this month. Net proceeds from these transactions are approximately CAD800 million, and as previously disclosed, we will be investing the majority of the proceeds back into our core business. We believe these investments will reinforce and expand our infrastructure advantage

Accordingly, we have created an accelerated capital fund, whereby we will reinvest up to CAD500 million to accelerate certain capital initiatives. The investments will take place over the next three years, including CAD100 million in F '13, CAD250 million in F '14, and the remaining CAD150 million in F '15. By advancing these investments, we will be able to realize the benefit sooner than originally contemplated. Following completion of these initiatives, we expect annual Cable capital expenditures to approximately CAD750 million, which results in a declining capital intensity profile for our Cable business. The key investments to be accelerated over the next three years include -- CAD120 million towards the completion of our Calgary data center; CAD50 million related to the expansion of our WiFi network across Western Canada; and CAD50 million on the development of additional innovative product offerings related to Shaw Go and other applications that are focused on enhancing customer experience. We will also direct funds towards further digitization of our network and additional bandwidth upgrades, as well as capital relating to the initial development of IP delivery of video

In addition to the core infrastructure and network investments we intend to make, earlier this week we announced that we have entered into agreement to purchase Envision from ENMAX. This acquisition will strengthen our Shaw business initiatives, and expand our market share in Calgary. Envision's assets provide an additional 800 [root] kilometers of fiber, and connect over 560 buildings throughout Calgary and the surrounding area. There is very little overlap with our existing [on net] building footprint in Calgary. The purchase price of CAD225 million represents approximately 11 times EBITDA. Envision essentially provides connectivity, and we believe there are significant synergy opportunities as we leverage our commercial Shaw business services. This acquisition reflects our commitment to investing and growing our business services, which is in line with our strategic plan

Our performance in the first half of 2013 is proof of our commitment to build sustainable value for shareholders by strengthening our competitive advantages and seizing opportunities. Our management team is committed to maintaining financial discipline, and our employees are focused on delivering exceptional customer experiences for our customers and viewers

I want to conclude by noting that during the second quarter, Shaw was recognized by the Financial Post as one of the Top 10 employers in Canada. As the only company on the list from our sector, my family and our management team are proud of this recognition. Being on this list is a reflection of the entire Shaw team, and we want to thank all our employees for their dedication and commitment every day

Thanks to everyone for joining us today, and we would now like to open the phones to answer any questions, operator

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [2]

Good morning. Thank you, operator, and thanks to everyone for joining us today to discuss our third-quarter results for fiscal 2013. With me today are members of our Senior Management team including Peter Bissonnette, President; Steve Wilson, Chief Financial Officer; Jay Mehr, Senior Vice President of Operations; Jean Brazeau, Senior Vice President of Regulatory; and Michael D'Avella, Senior Vice President of Planning. Before we begin our discussion on our recent results, I wanted to take a few minutes to address the severe flooding that has impacted Calgary and southern Alberta. As many of you know, the level of physical devastation is matched only by the personal loss felt by many residents, including some of our employees and our customers. Our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone affected by this disaster. We are grateful that our operations are intact and operating at close to full strength

Everyone at the Shaw has been doing what's necessary to ensure our customers can stay connected through Shaw's services. Our technical, maintenance, and customer care teams took immediate steps to maintain and repair Shaw's services for affected customers and to prevent further damage to our infrastructure. This response, combined with the strength of our network redundancy, limited the impact to our customers throughout Calgary and southern Alberta. We have deployed maintenance and customer care teams to create pop-up service tents in affected communities

We have opened up our Wi-Fi network in southern Alberta to help people stay connected. We increased staffing levels at our call centers and brought in technical staff from across the country. Global Calgary imported producers, camera operators, and reporters from other stations in order to maintain its excellent wall-to-wall coverage for our audience throughout Alberta. We are truly touched by all the efforts of all our employees to come to the aid of their neighbors and our customers. I want to thank them all for their commitment to our communities

Moving to our results, this morning we released our Q3 materials and we are pleased with our performance. The operating and competitive environment continues to normalize, our promotional activity remains rational, we remain focused on our strategy of generating sustainable and profitable growth. In Q3, we generated over CAD1.3 billion in consolidated revenue and CAD585 million in EBITDA, representing 4% and 3% growth respectively over the previous year. Free cash flow for the quarter was in excess of CAD135 million and year-to-date we have generated over CAD540 million in free cash flow

As we enter the final quarter of 2013, we are seeing continued positive momentum across [all] our divisions with ongoing revenue growth and overall management of costs. As a result, we are increasing our fiscal 2013 guidance and expect free cash flow to range from CAD590 million to CAD600 million. Given the improvement in free cash flow, and assuming continued favorable market conditions, our Board plans to target dividend increases of 5% to 10% over the next two years. This consideration further solidifies the confidence that our Board has in the ability of Senior Management to invest and grow the Business and execute our strategic priorities

Over the last several months we have announced a series of transactions focused on optimizing our portfolio of assets. On April 30, we closed the Envision acquisition and welcomed approximately 40 new employees to our Shaw business team. The acquisition expands our fibre footprint and business capabilities in Calgary. Results-to-date have been encouraging as we are beginning to capitalize on the opportunities to sell our Shaw business products and services to Envision customer base, which was predominantly focused on connectivity. Also on April 30, we closed the sale of our Hamilton Cable System to Rogers. The final sale price was approximately CAD400 million or 10 times EBITDA. During the quarter, we received an additional CAD350 million related to a series of agreements we entered into with Rogers

On June 11, we received CRTC approval regarding our purchase of the remaining one-third interest in TVtrop from Rogers and we expect this transaction to close at the end of the month. We recently announced at our Media Upfront presentation that we intend to rebrand this channel in the fall to DTOUR. This channel further strengthens our relationship with Scripps and is focused within the lifestyle category. Regarding the swap transaction we announced with Corus, we have closed the sale of our interest in ABC Spark and our acquisition of their 20% interest in the Food Network. The sale of our stakes in Historia and Series+ remains subject to CRTC approval, and we expect these transactions to close in the fall. At that time, we expect to receive approximately CAD95 million in cash in connection with the swap

We continue to make good progress with respect to our buildout of our Wi-Fi network across our operating footprint. We are excited that we have been able to enter into a series of agreements with key municipalities across Western Canada as these sites will complement our existing Wi-Fi network in these cities. Access to these venues is important, as we intend to provide our customers with a fairly ubiquitous coverage and a consistent experience throughout the city. The agreements we have entered into with each municipality differ. However, under each scenario, we believe we are creating tremendous value for Shaw's existing and potential customers

We believe that by bringing more awareness to our Wi-Fi service, along with the capability of our network, we are providing an exceptional experience and are enhancing the value proposition of Shaw products and services. During Q3, Anik G1 was successfully launched and, on May 29, we introduced more than 120 new HD channels to our satellite customers. Shaw Direct now carries the most HD channels in Canada and continues to be the only Canadian satellite Company that offers streaming video-on-demand to its set top boxes. This month, we have launched a national marketing campaign to build awareness and drive additional growth, as we are excited about our satellite HD leadership position

Our media business continues to perform well, as our conventional and specialty rankings improve and our news organization remains dominant in Western Canada. In March, we launched our BC regional news channel and, recently, were pleased to learn that we have been awarded the prestigious Edward R. Murrow Award for overall news excellence in network television. We are the first Canadian network to earn this recognition in the award's 42-year history. During the quarter, our media team was busy securing content for the important fall schedule. We are excited about our new commitments and feedback from our upfront presentation where we showcased our new shows has been positive. A total of 18 new programs have been secured, including 11 dramas. We believe these new programs complement returning favorites to the lineup such as Chicago Fire and Elementary

As we approach the end of fiscal 2013, we remain committed to our balanced approach to subscriber growth. As we discussed on our last call, we will be introducing service contracts, which include equipment, to our customers. This additional choice for our customers will be introduced this summer and our pricing of the service contract represents a continuation of our strategy regarding rational, sustainable, and profitable customer acquisition and retention initiatives. In conclusion, we are pleased with our Q3 results. Our solid growth in revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow demonstrates the soundness of our strategy, our operational strengths, and our competitive advantages. As the operating and competitive environment normalizes, we are proving that we are differentiating ourselves from our competitors based on the strength of our products and customer service. I want to thank our Senior Management team and all of our employees for their commitment to our customers

Before I turn the call over to the Q&amp;A portion, I want to take this opportunity to announce that Michael D'Avella, our Senior Vice President of Planning, will be retiring at the end of this fiscal year. Michael has dedicated over 22 years to Shaw and has added a tremendous value to our Organization throughout his tenure. Over the years, he has impacted and led in a variety of areas across our Organization. Michael has been a member of the Shaw leadership team from day one and he has helped to create and shape what Shaw is today. On behalf of myself, our family, and all of our colleagues at Shaw, we want to thank you for your contribution and efforts. We are pleased that you are continuing to help us in an advisory capacity and we will continue to benefit from your insight and expertise. Thank you, Michael

 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [2]

Thank you, operator. And thanks to everyone for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results for fiscal 2013. With me today are members of our senior management team including Peter Bissonnette, President; Steve Wilson, Chief Financial Officer; Jay Mehr, Senior Vice President of Operations; and Paul Robertson, President of Shaw Media

Our results this quarter reflect the continuation of our strategic and operational focus on profitable and sustainable initiatives. In fiscal 2013, we delivered innovative products and technology for our customers which combined with the delivery of exceptional customer service have helped strengthen our value proposition. Overall, in fiscal 2013, we delivered 3% revenue growth and EBITDA increased more than 4%. Free cash flow in fiscal 2013 was over $600 million which represents a 25% increase over the previous year

In our Cable division, revenue and EBITDA were up 2% and 5%, respectively, resulting in an annual cable margin in excess of 48%. Our focus on customer profitability, disciplined pricing, and value added services drove ARPU growth throughout the year. Our Satellite business delivered 2% revenue growth. EBITDA was tempered due to increased transponder costs relating to the launch of Anik G1. However, the investment in the new satellite strengthened our competitive positioning making Shaw the HD leader in Canada

Our Media business continues to perform exceptionally well, as revenue and EBITDA grew 5% and 6%, respectively. We continue to see a slow but steady improvement in the Canadian advertising market and increased subscriber revenues. A number of items contributed to our performance, notably, our continued investment in our network, content, products, and services. Broadband is the most important residential service to our customers and our Shaw GO WiFi network strongly differentiates our Internet product. Throughout the year, we have significantly expanded our WiFi network and we now have over 20,000 access points from Victoria to Sault Ste. Marie, giving customers access to the Internet on-the-go

Our WiFi service is included in all of our broadband packages, with over 300,000 customers and over 600,000 devices have authenticated and are using our Shaw GO WiFi network. Demand for our Shaw GO WiFi product is clearly having a positive effect as those that have utilized the WiFi service have a much lower propensity to churn. As data usage by our customers continues to increase exponentially, we believe that WiFi is an important overall component of the overall wireless ecosystem. Our WiFi network is aligned with our broadband strategy and we are confident and excited about the value and flexibility we are creating for our customers with these investments. Shaw GO WiFi also complements our TV Everywhere initiative as customers expect fast and reliable broadband connections outside of the home so they can still watch or catch up on the episodes of their favorite shows

With Shaw GO, we have laid the foundation for a successful TV Everywhere offering that is becoming an important part of our exceptional customer experience. We launched Shaw GO over a year ago with our flagship product Shaw GO Movie Central and have since added a number of compelling content offerings to the portfolio, including our recently launched Global GO app that provides our customers with more viewing options. In addition to live streaming, Global GO offers viewers full seasons of our hit shows, a first for any Canadian broadcaster. We have completed successfully negotiations with the majority of BDUs and are on track to hit our targeted subscription base of over 6 million by year end

Global GO along with the rest of our apps are a value-added offering only available to authenticated subscribers. We have an exciting lineup of TV Everywhere content planned for the year ahead which we believe provides significant value to a Shaw cable and satellite subscription over time. Global's new fall schedule is experiencing strong early season performance, particularly on new programs such as the Sleepy Hollow, the Blacklist, and the Millers. Global News continues to hold the number one position in our key Western markets and our redesigned news website has delivered an 85% growth in page views. Our specialty audiences have increased 4% on a season to date basis and we have nine of the top 20 specialty channels

Brand awareness plays an increasingly important role in our highly competitive operating environment. A clear and consistent brand message to our customers is an important way to differentiate our service and to create customer awareness and loyalty. Over the summer, we had a significant presence at two major international professional golf events in Canada. These provided Shaw with a national visibility and branding opportunities while giving back to our communities more than CAD1.25 million in charitable donations. The inaugural Shaw Charity Classic in Calgary was a resounding success, drawing crowds of over 40,000 people during the week. On the golf course, we showcased the strength of our WiFi network as well as the coverage provided by our global news team

As we enter fiscal 2014, the operating environment remains competitive. In this context, we are firmly committed to delivering exceptional customer experiences while focusing on customer profitability and operational efficiencies. We expect fiscal 2014 consolidated revenue and EBITDA growth in the range of 2% to 4%. This takes into account the impact of the M&amp;A transactions we completed in fiscal 2013. We expect a marginal decline in capital investment, excluding capital investments from the accelerated capital fund and a modest increase in cash taxes. Free cash flow is expected to range from CAD625 million to CAD650 million which provides additional support for the Board's target of a 5% to 10% dividend increase in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015

We are working to provide customers with a communications ecosystem characterized by world leading technology, networks, content, products and services. As customers demand connectivity and content, Shaw will deliver to them at the home, and on the go, with a Best-in-Class wired and WiFi networks. We embrace the opportunity to work with policy makers and all stakeholders so our industry has the flexibility to compete and make the right investments necessary to continue delivering exceptional customer experiences today and well into the future. Thanks to everyone for joining us today. We'd now like to open the phones to answer any questions, operator. Thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [2]

Thank you, operator, and thanks to everyone for joining us today to discuss our first-quarter fiscal 2014 results. With me today are members of our senior management team including Peter Bissonnette, President; Steve Wilson, Executive Vice President Corporate Development and CFO; Jay Mehr, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Paul Robertson, Executive Vice President and President of Shaw Media

Early today we held our annual general meeting and released our Q1 results. As we continue to execute on our strategic priorities, we remain focused on sustainable pricing initiatives, customer retention, and long-term growth

Reported consolidated revenue and EBITDA were up over 3% and 1%, respectively, in the first quarter, and we generated over CAD155 million in free cash flow. Adjusting for the net impact of acquisition and disposition activity in fiscal 2013, EBITDA was up 2% in the quarter compared to a year ago. Our performance this quarter was driven by growth in our commercial business, discipline around customer acquisition, and continued strength in our Internet business

Global continued to deliver solid programming results with the Black List, which is in the top 10, and Sleepy Hollow. Global news maintains the number-one position in all three major western markets. Our specialty portfolio contains the top five digital positions in the adult 25 to 54 category

Shaw business is becoming an increasingly important contributor to our consolidated performance. Recently, we announced the multi-year agreement with Canad Inns to deliver TV, voice, Internet, and data services to its 16 locations

We also continue to have success with the oil sands camps in northern Alberta with another project for Husky. We believe that we have considerable growth opportunities in this segment, and that we can deliver another year of approximately 20% growth

With Q1 off to a solid start, we remain on track to meet our fiscal-2014 revenue, EBITDA, and free-cash-flow targets. I am pleased to announce that today our Board approved an 8% dividend increase to CAD1.10 a share, which will become effective at the beginning of March. This increase continues our strong track record of returning capital to shareholders, as well as showcasing the confidence that the Board and senior management have in the long-term free-cash-flow profile of our Company

In FY14, we will continue to invest in our leading network infrastructure and delivery of next-generation services, which we believe will continue to drive growth into the future. During the quarter, we completed our DNU project, which has allowed for significant increased capacity in our network

As the Internet commands a bigger role in everyone's lives, customers expect better content, connectivity, and convenience. Now and in the future, we firmly believe that the Shaw broadband experience will set us apart from the competition. Our Wi-Fi network now consists of over 30,000 access points, and more than 300,000 customers have signed up to enjoy this value-added service

Last month, we also announced that Shaw was the successful bidder to provide the city of Calgary with public Wi-Fi in city-owned locations. We have now secured agreements with 38 municipalities to provide Wi-Fi service, and continue to focus on high-value sites, deploying a larger and denser footprint

Complementing Wi-Fi, we recently launched three additional Shaw GO apps: Treehouse, YTV, and A&amp;E, bringing our total to seven different apps to provide our customers with TV-everywhere capabilities. Global Go, which was launched in September, is live with seven BDUs reaching over 72% of Canadian paying television households

With FY14 off to a solid start, we remain committed to executing on our strategic priorities regarding delivery of exceptional customer and viewer experiences, leverage our leading technology, maintain and grow customer profitability, and realize further operational efficiencies. We continue to invest in our Calgary data center, additional bandwidth upgrades, further Wi-Fi expansion, IT transformation, and IP delivery

We are taking steps and making changes as a management team to improve our decision-making process to sharpen our focus and prioritize our projects so we operate more effectively and efficiently to serve our customers and viewers. As change continues to shape the industry for both our customers and our Company, we are excited about the possibilities and the future at Shaw

Thanks to everyone for joining us today, and we would now like to open the phones to answer any questions, operator

 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [2]

Thank you, operator. Thanks to everyone for joining us today to discuss our second quarter FY14 results. With me today are members of our senior management team including Peter Bissonnette, President; Steve Wilson, Executive Vice President - Corporate Development and CFO; Jay Mehr, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Paul Robertson, Executive Vice President and President of Shaw Media

Earlier today we released our Q2 financial and operating results, which represent the ongoing execution of our strategic priorities and our focus on sustainable pricing initiatives. We continue to leverage our leading network infrastructure and our high quality content to drive profitability and long-term growth

We saw an improvement in subscriber metrics for all of our products, particularly in broadband where we added almost 13,000 customers, our best result in the last seven quarters. Year to date we have generated revenue and EBITDA growth, adjusted for net impact of acquisitions and disposition activity in FY14 up 3% and 1%, respectively, and free cash flow of CAD315 million

Q2 results were affected by softness in our media division, as advertising dollars shifted towards the Sochi Olympics more than expected. However, our strong specialty portfolio continued to deliver growth. Considering our year-to-date performance and expectations for the second half of the year, we remain on track to meet our consolidated FY14 guidance targets that were outlined in November

We expanded our Wi-Fi network, with more than 35,000 access points throughout our footprint now available to customers. More and more customers are using and experiencing the benefits of our carrier-grade Wi-Fi network on a daily basis

This extension of our broadband service is improving retention and supporting the value proposition of our internet products. An important part of our Wi-Fi strategy has been to partner with municipalities to provide Wi-Fi service for residents and visitors of the communities. We have now successfully entered over 40 agreements, which include all the major municipalities within our footprint. As we expand and create more awareness of our Wi-Fi network, we believe that Shaw broadband experience will continue to set us apart from the competition

During the quarter we released our eighth Shaw TV Everywhere App, HISTORY Go, which includes 300 hours of popular programming, including The Vikings, last year's number one specialty drama, and Yukon Gold, the network's top Canadian unscripted program in 2013. Earlier this week we announced three additional kids apps, Shaw Go Family, Disney XD, and Disney Junior, and now available and provide access to popular children's shows

We remain dedicated to providing TV subscribers greater choice and flexibility over what they watch, how they watch, and when they watch their favorite content. This now includes over 2,200 hours of content available for viewing across all our Shaw Go Apps

In January we successfully completed an CAD800 million financing transaction, which further extends our maturity profile and lowers our overall cost of debt. We used CAD600 million of the proceeds for early redemption of our 6.5% senior notes, which were originally due in 2014, June 2014

At the end of Q2, we continue to have significant liquidity with over CAD440 million of cash available and an undrawn CAD1 billion credit facility. Net debt of 2.0 times is at the low end of our range of 2 to 2.5 times, which is continues to provide us with tremendous flexibility

We recognize that in order to compete effectively in today's environment we need to proactively identify and capitalize on revenue and cost efficiencies within our business. As we enter into the back half of FY14, we remain committed to executing on our strategic priorities, specifically operational efficiencies

Following our announcement in December regarding changes to our senior leadership team, we have recently combined both our engineering and IT departments, bringing these two groups together under common technology and network operations group. We will be more focused on prioritizing strategic projects and efficiently delivering innovative products and services to all of our customers

We will continue to evaluate additional opportunities across all aspects of our business and will be providing more information regarding this progress, including other organizational improvements over the coming quarters. Thanks to everyone for joining us today, and we would now like to open the phones to answer any questions, operator

Mr. Shaw, I will now turn the call over to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [2]

Thank you, operator. And thanks to everyone for joining us today to discuss third-quarter fiscal 2014 results. With me today are members of our senior management team, including Peter Bissonnette, President; Steve Wilson, Executive Vice President Corporate Development and CFO; Jay Mehr, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Paul Robertson, Executive Vice President and President of Shaw Media

Earlier today we released our Q3 financial and operating results. We are pleased with our performance and remain focused on delivering exceptional customer and viewer experiences, leading technology, operational efficiencies, and value for all our stakeholders

We continue to balance financial results with maintenance of overall RGUs. In the quarter, cable RGUs increased by over 5,000 led by another strong quarter of broadband additions. Video losses moderated in Q3. However, this is partially due to a strong quarter of business net additions of approximately 6,000

On a reported basis, consolidated revenue for the quarter and year to date was CAD1.3 billion, and CAD3.9 billion, respectively. Consolidated Q3 operating income before restructuring costs of CAD601 million improved by 3% over the comparable quarter. And cable operating income growth was strong, up 5% sequentially, driven by customer growth, price adjustments, and lower costs

We remain on track to meet our previously disclosed guidance of 2% to 4% of revenue and operating income growth. Adjusting our reported results to reflect the net impact of M&amp;A, operating income for the quarter and year to date period is up 4% and 2%, respectively. Year to date we have generated CAD555 million in free cash flow. And we now expect to exceed the top end of our FY14 free cash flow guidance of CAD625 million to CAD650 million

We continue to scale our WiFi network and we now have over 40,000 access points. Approximately 25% of our Internet base is using our WiFi service. And over 1 million devices have now been registered on our network

A primary benefit of the WiFi service is the fact we are increasing the value proposition of our products. Recent surveys are confirming that the likelihood to recommend or move to Shaw continues to increase due to our WiFi service. And there's been a notable reduction in churn for our customers that utilize our WiFi network. On a year-to-date basis, broadband churn is approximately 35% lower than those Internet customers not using WiFi

We want to be our customers' primary network with the best-in-class in-home WiFi experience that is complemented by our Shaw Go WiFi network outside of the home. In support of this strategy, we continue to partner with municipalities to enhance the scale of our WiFi network. And we have secured over 50 agreements to date. On May 13, in a joint press conference with the City of Calgary we launched the first four locations. And we will continue with our marketing efforts to create more awareness regarding the benefits of our WiFi service, and drive customer usage

On June 4, we held our annual upfront media presentation. We remain focused on delivering premium and compelling content across all platforms. And our upcoming programming schedule was well received by advertising and industry executives

In LA, we purchased 12 new programs this year compared to 18 a year a go. We have a number of top returning shows on Global, which provides stability that advertisers are seeking. In the fall, replacing Mystery and Twist, we will launch two new specialty channels -- Crime + Investigation, and For Your Information -- which further solidifies Shaw's media specialty portfolio within the lifestyle genre

In addition to the linear rights we continue to buy the stacking and SVOD rights to support our TV Everywhere initiatives. Our 11 Shaw Go apps are proving to be popular, as 10 million hours of content has been watched by Canadians through the TV Everywhere apps. We continue to expand our TV Everywhere strategy with the goal of providing our customers greater choice and flexibility over what they watch, how they watch, and when they watch their favorite content

Further to our organizational announcement on April 14, we have taken the first steps toward the Company-wide transformation that we will call Focus to Deliver. This new structure will streamline Shaw into three clear units -- consumer, business, and media. And will become the new reporting structure for our financial and operating results beginning in Q1 of FY15

The key outcomes of our Focus to Deliver program include an improvement in customer satisfaction, an effective customer-centric organization, a cost structure that enables future growth, and high employee engagement. As part of this new structure, approximately 400 management and non-customer-facing roles were affected, and the elimination of these roles will be completed by the end of July. In connection with this restructuring, we recorded a one-time charge of CAD53 million, and expect annual savings net of new hires will be approximately CAD50 million

As Focus to Deliver is a multi-year transformational program, we have identified a number of key initiatives that will align with our strategic priorities. The first critical step was the organizational realignment and performance management, which is nearly complete. The remaining initiatives center on our strategic pillars of exceptional customer service, leading technology, customer profitability, and operational efficiency

We are evolving from a traditional cable and media company to a network and content experience leader, delivering connectivity and programming across multiple platforms and services. We remain focused on driving performance and value for all of our stakeholders through continuous enhancement and improvements in our operation

Thanks to everyone for joining us today. And we would now like to open the phones to answer any questions, operator

 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [2]

Great. Thank you. Thank you, operator, and thanks to everyone for joining us today to discuss our 2014 fourth-quarter and year-end results

With me today are members of our senior management team, including Steve Wilson, Executive Vice President, Corporate Development and CFO; Jay Mehr, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Barb Williams, Executive Vice President and President, Shaw Media; Nancy Phillips, Co-founder, President and CEO of ViaWest. Unfortunately, our President, Peter Bissonnette, is not with us today as he is flat out, under the weather, and is unable to join us this afternoon

Early today we released our Q4 financial and operating results. We are pleased with our performance and remain focused on delivering exceptional customer and viewer experiences, leading technology, operational efficiencies, and value for our stakeholders

Our diligent cost management and disciplined pricing approach to the market continues to resonate in our financial results. In Q4, we delivered consolidated EBITDA growth of 6% compared to a year ago, and our cable EBITDA margin in the quarter was in excess of 49%. We continue to invest in and leverage our superior network, which now exceeds 850,000 kilometers of fibre throughout North America, and over 45,000 WiFi hotspots across Canada

We continue to balance financial results with maintenance of our overall customer base. We had another quarter of strong broadband additions of approximately 12,000, and we continue to have over 6.1 million RGUs

In FY14, we delivered 3% revenue and EBITDA growth. Free cash flow in FY14 was approximately CAD698 million, which represents a 16% increase over the previous year. Our FY14 results meet our revenue and EBITDA guidance, and we exceeded our increased free cash flow guidance of CAD650 million, which was actually increased in June from our original guidance released in October

We expect FY15 consolidated EBITDA growth to range between 5% and 7%, including our target FY15 ViaWest EBITDA of $85 million. Consolidated free cash flow is expected to exceed CAD650 million, after accounting for additional interest expense, and investments associated with the ViaWest and increased cash taxes. Besides our FY15 financial guidance, we are also pleased to confirm some other key metrics, including FY15 dividend growth target of 5% to 10%, target leverage ratio of 2 to 2.5 times, the completion of our ACF program of CAD150 million in FY15, and long-term annual core cable CapEx of CAD750 million

We continue to provide our customers with innovative products that drive value, and we are focused on strengthening our strategy of being the leading content and network Company. This includes our TV Everywhere, OTT, and WiFi investments

We remain committed to providing our subscribers with greater choice and flexibility over what they watch, how they watch, and when they watch their favorite content. We continue to scale our WiFi network, and now have over 45,000 access points, and over 1.25 million active registered devices on our network

Our WiFi network continues to support the value proposition of our products, which is reflected in higher user likelihood to recommend and lower broadband churn. Approximately 75% of surveyed customers have confirmed their likelihood to recommend, or move to Shaw due to our WiFi service

Active internet WiFi customers also have approximately 35% lower churn rate than those internet customers not utilizing our WiFi service. The investment in our WiFi initiatives is supportive of our strategic objective of being our customer's primary network, with a best-in-class in-home WiFi experience that is complemented by our Shaw Go WiFi network outside of the home

We completed the ViaWest acquisition on September 2. The transaction provides us with a growth platform in the attractive North American data center sector, and is another significant step in expanding our technology offerings for mid-market enterprises in Western Canada. We are excited to jointly deliver with Nancy and her entire team of ViaWest's next phase of growth in the US, and utilizing the ViaWest experience to accelerate the development of our Canadian data center platform

Our investments in programming, technology, and innovative products, combined with our focus on exceptional customer experience and operational efficiencies continue to drive profitability and long-term growth. We remain focused on driving performance and value for all of our stakeholders through continuous enhancements and improvements in our operations

Before we open the call for questions, I want to take a few minutes to thank Steve, and wish him all the best in his retirement. Steve has been an integral part of our Company since joining us over 10 years ago, and we are in much stronger financial and strategic position because of his contributions. Steve has obviously been a key participant in our interactions with investors and the research community over the last decade, and I know Steve wanted to say a few words before we continue

Steve?

Steve Wilson,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP Corporate Development, CFO   [3]

Thanks, Brad, for the kind words

10 years ago I traveled with my family to Calgary to join Shaw as CFO. Over the last 10 years, I have had the opportunity to work with one of the best teams in this industry. The Company has grown substantially from analog TV to phone, and now the leader in high-speed broadband, with a successful media operation

Revenue and shareholder value have increased significantly, and along the way we did some important game-changing acquisitions. We were also one of the leading MSOs in North America to introduce a dividend

It has been a great ride for the last 10 years, and I will miss the day-to-day excitement of the industry, as well as the talented and engaging people at Shaw. The Company is in great shape, both strategic and financially, and the foundational investments are in place to continue its track record of success

After a decade like that, I have decided to change pace. I am looking forward to continuing my community work as a member of the Board of Governors of the University of Calgary, doing public and other Board work, and potentially some teaching and writing

I am extremely proud of the finance organization. They are dynamic, capable, strategic thinking, and provide the support needed by the business. They also work hard to ensure that there are no miscues and, and there have been none. I am happy to be joined on the call by some of them to address questions that may arise today

This will be my last conference call, and I won't be taking questions, but I do get a parting word. There are many brilliant and thoughtful analysts, investors who have been a pleasure to work with. I leave you with the recommendation that you never underestimate the strength of commitments of the family, the Board, and a great senior leadership team

They are clear-thinking in their strategy, prepared to make the investments necessary, and forward-looking to navigate the many changes we will see in this industry in the coming years

Brad, it has been a pleasure working with you, J.R., Jim, and the whole team over the last decade. And I look forward to tracking your achievements in the years to come

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [4]

Thanks, Steve

Well, as Steve mentioned, we are happy to be joined today in the room by other senior members of our finance team, including Rhonda Bashnick, Senior Vice President of Finance, and Trevor English, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and Capital Markets

I would now like to ask Nancy to give some insight on ViaWest, and we recently had our first Board meeting. And I will ask her to say a few things, and then we will go from there. Nancy?

Nancy Phillips,  Shaw Communications Inc - ViaWest, Co-founder, President and CEO   [5]

Great. Thanks, Brad

We had the pleasure this week of hosting the Shaw Board, and many of the Shaw executive team members here in Denver, Colorado. I am going to designate them as our lucky charm for the Broncos, so let's see if we can win tonight as well. But obviously, great, a week that we were able to engage on many fronts

And I think the theme was really just a lot of excitement about the adjacencies and the products that we are bringing to the market. We continue to see great traction and opportunities emerging, not only here in the United States, but my team and a genuine, real excitement around the Canadian market opportunity, and what we can do. Clearly, we think that the breadth of services that we have honed over the last several years are really compelling, and very excited to get started here in the summer of 2015, with our flagship Calgary data center, that we are working actively on, in terms of getting that up and operational

We are starting to see early demand, both coming from the US and Western Canada. And obviously, working very closely with many of the team members to create the right synergies, as we move into that marketplace with the Shaw business unit

So overall, very excited. I think a real positive, on selling fronts, excited in terms of the opportunity ahead for the Company, and happy to answer any questions that you might have here this afternoon

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [6]

Okay, great. Thanks, Nancy

So thanks everybody for joining us today. And operator, we now would like to open the phone for questions

 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications - CEO   [2]

Thank you, Operator, and thanks to everyone for joining us today to discuss our first-quarter FY15 results. With me today are members of our Senior Management team including Peter Bissonnette, President; Jay Mehr, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Barb Williams, Executive Vice President and President Shaw Media; Nancy Phillips, co-Founder, President and CEO of ViaWest; Rhonda Bashnick, Senior Vice President of Finance; and Trevor English, Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Capital Markets

Earlier today we held our annual general meeting and released our Q1 financial and operating results. Our disciplined management and unrelenting focus on our operations continue to deliver strong financial results. We are off to a solid start in FY15 with positive momentum across our businesses, as reflected in our strong subscriber metrics in residential Cable and Internet

In Q1, we delivered consolidated revenue growth of 2% and free cash flow of CAD193 million. RGU losses of approximately 20,000 improved by more than 42% in total and by over 90% excluding Satellite losses of approximately 18,000 compared to the same time last year. We are on track to achieve our FY15 guidance including annual free cash flow of more than CAD650 million, and remain confident on our underlying strategy and business outlook

Accordingly, I am pleased to announce that today our Board approved an 8% dividend increase to CAD1.185 per share, which will become effective at the end of March. This increase is consistent with our previously stated targeted annual dividend growth of 5% to 10% for F15 and a testament to the strength of our operational capacity to grow free cash flow. This increase also marks the 11th consecutive annual increase of 5% or more, continuing our strong track record of returning capital to shareholders. Over the past five years alone, we have returned more than CAD2 billion to our shareholders

Q1 also marks the first quarter under our new subscriber-focused organizational structure. Our Cable and Satellite business segments were strategically realigned to better serve and grow the customer bases. This new organizational structure is part of our focus to deliver multi year program to enhance efficiency, productivity, and improve customer service capabilities across our organization

During the quarter, we also welcomed the ViaWest management team and employees to Shaw with the completion of the acquisition in early September. We look forward to capitalizing on synergies and growing the data center platform operations in the North American market, through a newly created business infrastructure services segment which will include both ViaWest and our Canadian data center initiatives

We remain committed to providing our subscribers with greater choice and flexibility over what they watch, how they watch and when they watch their favorite content. In addition to our existing 13 TV Everywhere apps we launched shomi in November through a joint venture with Rogers

We continue to scale our WiFi network and now have over 55,000 access points and over 1.5 million active registered devices on our network. Our customers continue to value -- sorry, our customers continue to find value in this product, which has now achieved 30% penetration of our Internet base while maintaining 35% lower churn levels across a much wider user base

We just returned from the CES last week and it's clearer than ever that technology is putting customers firmly in control of their experiences. And we couldn't be more excited. And we are not standing still. We are making the fundamental changes necessary for our Company to focus on the opportunities that this new environment provides

We are taking strategic steps to transform and diversify our business mix. And we are allocating resources to provide the greatest long-term benefit to shareholders and customers. We are doing all these things while respecting our roots as a pioneering cable Company where we care about every customer, viewer and employee. Thanks to everyone for joining us today and we would now like to open the phones to answer any questions, Operator

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [2]

Thank you, Operator. Thanks to everyone for joining us today to discuss our second-quarter FY15 results. With me today are members of the senior management team, including Peter Bissonnette President; Jay Mehr, Executive Vice President Chief Operating Officer; Barb Williams, Executive Vice President and President Shaw Media; Nancy Phillips, Co-Founder and CEO of ViaWest; Rhonda Bashnick, Senior Vice President of Finance; and Trevor English, Senior Vice President Corporate Development and Capital Markets

Earlier today we released our Q2 financial and operating results. In the quarter we delivered consolidated revenue and EBITDA growth year over year of 5% and 5.5%, respectively

Free cash flow in Q2 was almost CAD170 million, and year to date we have generated over CAD360 million of free cash flow. This represents an increase of 15% compared to the same six-month period a year ago

We maintained our focus on profitability and maintenance of our overall RGU base. We are pleased with the margin performance of all of our business segments. And while our subscriber results reflected the impact of the 30-day disconnect policy by approximately 35,000 RGUs, our entire customer base remains in excess of 6 million RGUs

We continue to scale our Wi-Fi network, and now have approximately 60,000 access points and over 1.7 million active registered devices on our network. Our customers continue to find value in this product, which has now achieved 33% penetration of our Internet base, while maintaining 30% lower churn levels across a much wider user base

We have now successfully entered into approximately 80 municipal agreements which include all of the major municipalities within our footprint. As we expand and create more awareness of our Wi-Fi network, we believe the Shaw broadband experience will continue to set us apart from our competition

We are encouraged by the financial and operational benefits related to some of the restructuring initiatives we began to rollout last year as part of our multi-year Focus to Deliver program. Focus to Deliver is becoming ingrained in our corporate and operating DNA and represents a more focused and disciplined approach in executing on components of our strategy, enhancing our efficiency and growth potential, while better serving the needs of our customers and viewers

More specifically, during the quarter we effected a realignment of our customer care operations in the consumer division, which accounted for the majority of the CAD38 million restructuring charge. We anticipate annual savings of CAD25 million once the realignment is complete and operating efficiencies are realized

It has been a busy quarter with respect to the regulatory environment. The CRC announced a number of decisions regarding last fall's Let's Talk TV hearing. While the new regulatory environment will not be without its challenges, we support the government's direction and the Commission's commitment to maximize choice for Canadians

It is difficult to estimate or predict the possible long-term operating and financial impact to our respective businesses. However, we believe that, through the provision of innovative and flexible packages, and a differentiated broadband service experience, we believe that our distribution business is appropriately positioned to compete in a profitable manner under the revised regulations that become effective in 2016

Our media business last week announced an organizational realignment that is focused around strengthening the two core pillars in Shaw Media's business -- content and revenue. Shaw Media has a portfolio of strong brands and engaging content that is valued by our viewers. And we are focused on repositioning our media business to reflect the realities of the operating and regulatory environment

In closing, I want to reaffirm our year-to-date performance is on track. As we head into the last half of the year we continue to be on track to deliver our FY15 guidance, including annual free cash flow of more than CAD650 million and EBITDA growth between 5% and 7%. Thanks to everyone for joining us today and we would now like to open the phones to answer any questions

Thank you, operator. And thanks to everyone for joining us today to discuss our third quarter FY15 results.

I would like to start the call with two brief announcements before we get into more [fullsome] discussion regarding our quarterly results. The first announcement is to officially welcome Vito, our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer who started with us June 1st. Vito is a great fit for Shaw as we enter our next phase of growth

His background and previous experience will be a tremendous asset as we continue to deliver an exceptional customer experience, and compete in this dynamic industry. Vito has a strong reputation related to the development and leadership of a best-in-class finance organization that is focused on partnering with the business to help drive results. We look forward to his contribution, and are pleased to welcome him to the Shaw team

The second announcement is the retirement of a dear friend and colleague, Peter Bissonette, on August 31st of this year. Peter has been a mainstay at Shaw for over 25 years. His contributions have helped build Shaw to the great Company that it is today. He has helped to guide us through significant growth, acquisitions, new product launches in an ever-changing regulatory and competitive environment

Peter, your insight and stewardship will be missed by all. We wish you health, happiness, and all the best in your retirement. And since this is your very last conference call, I'll ask you to say a few words before we get to the details of the quarter

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Peter Bissonnette,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President   [3]

Wow, thanks, Brad. During my 26 years at Shaw, I've actually participated in almost 90 analyst calls. It's like 10 baseball games. The world has changed, and I'm proud to say that Shaw has been a part of that change for Canadians from coast to coast

I'm retiring knowing that the future looks very, very bright for Shaw and its shareholders, its customers and employees. And I want to make a special thank you to each of our business analysts for your participation, your interest and focus on Shaw and this very exciting industry. Over these many years we've come to actually look forward to your perspective on our business

Going forward, I will continue my involvement with Shaw as a member of the Board, and look forward to sharing my insights learned as an officer of this great family Company. Thanks, Brad

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [4]

Thank you, Peter

Earlier today, we released our Q3 financial and operating results. Third quarter results were strong, with each business segment delivering year-over-year growth, led by business network services and business infrastructure services

In the quarter, we delivered consolidated revenue and EBITDA growth year-over-year of 6% and 7% respectively. Q3 free cash flow of CAD256 million represented a 7% increase compared to the same period a year ago. As we move into the final quarter of this year, we are on track to deliver our fiscal year financial guidance, with EBITDA expected to be near the lower end of our 5% to 7% range and free cash flow to exceed CAD650 million

We remain disciplined with our pricing and promotional strategies, and had another strong quarter of over 7,000 broadband net additions. And we continue to have a strong base of loyal and engaged customers, totaling over six million consumer and business RGUs

As we discussed during our prior quarter's conference call, we have moved away from bundling and promotional strategies on home phone products that were previously attracting low ARPU customers. And to focus our efforts on the value propositions that our customers are increasingly demanding

This is reflected in our RGU results this quarter, where home phone accounted for almost half of total RGU losses. However, our overall consumer ARPU remains strong

Shaw Go Wi-Fi continues to add significant value to our broadband service, and remains a key differentiating factor. With approximately 65,000 access points, over a third of Shaw broadband customers are actively using Shaw Go Wi-Fi, averaging 1 gigabit per month outside of the home. Even as we go deeper into our broadband base, we continue to exhibit an impressive 25% lower churn profile compared to customers that do not use Wi-Fi

Each quarter, we build momentum with this service. And we will continue to optimize coverage and improve network performance through the strategic deployment of additional access points and new technologies

The initiatives that we have started under our Focus to Deliver program are having the desired effect on our customers. The likelihood to recommend has increased 3% from the last quarter to 76%. And we continue to introduce new tools and features to both our customers and employees to make every interaction count

The first phase of our call center realignment is well under way. And our consumer margin of over 46% reflects the result of our multi-year Focus to Deliver initiatives. During Q3, we continue to refine our strategy within our business segment, where we expect to drive strong growth going forward

Our media team recently returned from LA with some new and exciting properties that will start premiering this fall adding to our already strong programming lineup. Following this, we held our annual Upfronts in Toronto earlier this month, with our approach this year reflecting the changing nature of our industry. Instead of doing one mass event, we are doing a variety of different events, targeted at specific audiences

As previously disclosed, this quarter, we announced organizational changes focused on improving our media division's cost base. And laying the foundation to transform from a traditional broadcaster to a broader media company. The evolution from a broadcaster to a media organization reflects the focus to encompass all types of content across all platforms, engaging and monetizing audiences in the rapidly changing industry

Scale is a key factor in our business, particularly as we enter the world of next generation video. Today, we are excited to announce that we are working closely with Comcast to begin a technical trial on their cloud based X1 platform

Shaw is the first in Canada to capitalize on the Comcast cloud technology, offering consumers a seamless experience across multiple screens and devices, both in and out of home. We are building partnerships that deliver best-in-class customer experiences, and we look forward to providing more updates as we move forward throughout the coming months

In closing, I would like to congratulate Guy and the entire Rogers team on gaining industry Canada approval on the spectrum transfer. It was a complicated and difficult file, and Rogers certainly used some great creativity to get over the finish line. Well done

This represents the conclusion of a multifaceted transaction for Shaw that occurred over a number of years. In 2013, we entered into a transaction whereby we sold our Hamilton Cable assets and an option on our AWS Spectrum for total valuation of CAD750 million

Over the last three years, we have invested CAD500 million of the proceeds into our accelerated capital fund. The ACF plan has worked and has changed the trajectory of Shaw. Our investments in data centers, Wi-Fi, digital network upgrades, and next generation back office have enabled the evolution of Shaw from a cable company into a broadband company

We are excited about the future, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We'd now like to open the phones and answer any questions

Welcome to the Shaw Communications fourth-quarter and FY15 year-end conference call. Today's call will be hosted by Mr. Brad Shaw, CEO of Shaw Communications. The conference is being recorded

(Operator Instructions)
 Before we begin, Management would like to remind listeners that comments made during today's call will include forward-looking information and there are risks that actual results could differ materially. Please refer to the Company's publicly-filed documents for more details on assumptions and risks. Mr. Shaw, I'll now turn the call over to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [2]

Thank you, Operator, and thanks to everyone for joining us today to discuss our fourth-quarter and FY15 year-end results. With me today are members of our Senior Management team including Jay Mehr, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Vito Culmone, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Barb Williams, Executive Vice President and President Shaw Media; and Nancy Phillips, Co-Founder and CEO of ViaWest

Our annual and quarterly operating results represent a continuation of our strategic and financial focus. And for the year we delivered consolidated EBITDA of growth of over 5% and free cash flow of CAD653 million, meeting our 2015 guidance targets. Vito will discuss our financial results in more details in a moment after I touch on some of the key developments during the quarter

In Q4, our consolidated business delivered over 6% revenue and 9% EBITDA growth. However, subscriber losses of [74,000] accelerated due to aggressive competitive activity, the impact of the economic downturn in Alberta and the continued phone losses as we maintained our focus on high value customers and long-term profitable bundling strategies. Despite the increase in subscriber losses, our consumer division delivered 3% EBITDA growth in Q4 and maintained a healthy 46% margin

Business network services launched a number of new products during the quarter including SmartVoice. This new phone product provides a unified communications solution to small business to enhance productivity by allowing employees to collaborate seamlessly across their traditional business desktop phone, mobile devices and computers in or outside of the office

We also launched managed hotel Wi-Fi which provides a cloud-based Wi-Fi product that is a fully managed solution for the hospitality market. Early results from these launches are positive and represent significant progress relating to the strategic initiatives and direction we are taking following the realignment of our business network division earlier this year

Business infrastructure services continues to meet our expectations and the fundamentals of the data center business remain strong. We are experiencing an increase in customer demand, which is a positive indicator of revenue performance as we move into FY16. Over the long term, we continue to believe that revenue and EBITDA growth will be in the low to mid double-digits

During the quarter we announced the opening of two new facilities, including the Hillsboro, Oregon flagship facility with over 50,000 square feet of space and the Calgary facility which is opening this fall. Our Calgary data center is the state-of-the-art facility and represents the first Canadian offering developed through our partnership with ViaWest. The launch of this new data center will allow Shaw Business to help organizations meet their expanding IT needs by providing a fully configurable, hybrid solution backed by a 16-year track record with ViaWest

As we move into FY16, we remain committed to our strategic priorities and advancing our technology road map. In Q3 we announced that we are working with Comcast to begin a technical trial of their cloud-based X1 platform and that will be the first in Canada to capitalize on their cloud technology. We are confident that our partnership with Comcast on the X1 journey will allow us to reinvigorate our video road map and bring momentum back to our video business

At the beginning of October we launched our new Shaw Home Gateway, the XG1, which is a whole home PVR with our Moxi user experience. This set-top is currently being deployed by Comcast and is a forward compatible with the X1 service

To date, we are pleased with the progress of the trial. However, as it remains ongoing we are not yet at the point where we provide details regarding the partnership and the specific economics related to the long-term arrangement

The X1 platform that is to be deployed is entirely built on Comcast infrastructure. Commands such as channel changes, user interface and video-on-demand titles will be powered directly by Comcast infrastructure and not processed in Shaw's facilities. So you can appreciate the complexity and the time requirements around the trial to ensure we have a robust service when we officially launch in FY16

Another strategic priority of for us is in the broadband space, where there have been a lot of announcements by the industry about gigabyte speed capability. Our customers will always have access to the best network available and we are completely aligned with the cable industry approach DOCSIS 3.1 advantage and the broad go-to-market differentiated internet experiences

Recall that our first digital network upgrade removed the first tier of analog channels. During FY15 we removed all remaining analog signals from Vancouver and the lower mainland and we will continue this is part of our digital network upgrade, which we referred to as Phase 2 in FY16

At the end of the year we plan to have over 95% of our customers all digital. This opens up significant amount of additional capacity within our network and plans for us to deliver DOCSIS 3.1 in 2016 remain on track

The customer experience remains front and center for us. Not only are we launching new products and investing in people and technology, we remain focused on capitalizing on additional efficiencies such as our call center realignment and our commitment to our focus to deliver multi-year program

Concerning both the opportunities and challenges that we face going into FY16, we are targeting EBITDA to the range between flat and low single-digit growth over 2015, including the costs associated with the X1 platform. Capital investment is expected to be approximately CAD850 million in the consumer business network services and media divisions and approximately CAD130 million in the business infrastructure services division. In FY16, we anticipate free cash flow of between CAD665 million to CAD680 million, representing year-over-year growth of 2% to 4%

Now, I invite Vito to provide more detailed overview of the financial results

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc  - EVP &amp; CFO   [3]

Thank you, Brad, and hello, everyone on the call. It's great to be here, and with a full quarter now under my belt I appreciate the opportunity to get into more detail regarding our financial results. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of my colleagues at Shaw for assisting me up the learning curve, and in particular, a shout out to the finance team for their great work day in day out and through the reporting cycle

Let's first start with the fourth quarter where consolidated revenue and EBITDA were up over 6% and 9%, respectively, as Brad mentioned earlier. On an organic basis, i.e. excluding the results of the business infrastructure services division, our year-over-year EBITDA growth in Q4 was 4.5%. Each business segment delivered year-over-year growth and let me address each one individually

In our consumer division, revenue was up slightly and EBITDA increased over 3% compared to Q4 2014. Despite the increased subscriber loss, total cable ARPU is up 2% year over year with a strong 9% growth in broadband. Business network services delivered revenue and EBITDA growth of over 6% and 7%, respectively

Margins remained healthy at over 50% while we continue to invest in new managed product and service offerings such as SmartVoice and managed hotel Wi-Fi while also ramping up our sales force. Additions to the sales team will continue into FY16, which will have an impact on EBITDA growth in the near term. However, we believe these resources and scaling will support double-digit revenue growth in FY16

Business infrastructure services delivered Q4 revenue of CAD68 million, which is a 7% increase over Q3 2015. Reported EBITDA of CAD24 million includes a number of one-time costs related to employees as well a start-up costs from Calgary data center. For informational purposes, the stand-alone US ViaWest business delivered revenue and EBITDA growth of 10% and 11%, respectively, for FY15. We are extremely pleased with the progress and trajectory in this business

Our media business delivered solid year-over-year growth this quarter, with EBITDA up by CAD7 million or 17%, due mainly to higher subscriber revenues combined with lower programming, employee-related and promotional costs. For the year, revenue and EBITDA from our media assets declined by 1.5% and 3%, respectively, as reduced advertising on specialty channels and the effect of a disposition in the prior year have [Historia] and Sirius Plus were partially offset by increases in conventional air time and subscriber revenues

Net income for the quarter on a consolidated basis was CAD276 million, or CAD0.57 per share and included a one-time gain of CAD158 million as we received the final payment from Rogers regarding the wireless spectrum. Total capital spending in FY15, including the accelerated capital fund, was CAD1.1 billion

We continue to invest growth capital into business network services and business infrastructure services. Total capital investments in FY16 are expected to decline from FY15 levels and we remain comfortable with CAD850 million as the base consumer business network and media spend

Our balance sheet remains strong with total debt of approximately CAD5.7 billion and a leverage ratio of 2.3 times at the end of the fiscal year. We continue to have ample liquidity through both our cash balance of CAD400 million and available credit facilities. With that, Brad, I'll turn it back to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [4]

Thank you, Vito. To conclude we are excited about the year ahead and we have some great new products that will enter the market and we believe we are well positioned to meet the demands of our customers and to deliver value for all of our stakeholders

Thank you and we'd now like to open the phones to answer any questions

Operator   [1]

Welcome to the Shaw Communications first-quarter 2016 conference call and webcast. Today's call will be hosted by Mr. Jay Mehr, Executive VP and COO

(Operator Instructions)
 Before we begin, management would like to remind listeners that comments made during today's call will include forward-looking information, and there are risks that actual results could differ materially. Please refer to the Company's publicly filed documents for more details on assumptions and risks

At this time, I would like to hand the call over to Mr. Mehr. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Jay Mehr,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; COO   [2]

Great, thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today

Regrettably, Brad is unavailable to lead today's investor call, as he has a severe case of the flu, and we wish him a speedy recovery. In his absence, I'll take you through his prepared remarks, and the team will be available for questions

We want to take this opportunity to address this transformational time in our Company's journey, including the announcement yesterday regarding the sale of Shaw Media to Corus. We're making some significant advances for all of our stakeholders, and I want to discuss Brad's vision for the future. We will also address the first-quarter operating and financial results, before we open up for questions

With me today are members of our senior management team including Vito Culmone, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Barb Williams, Executive Vice President, and President of Shaw Media; Nancy Phillips, Co-founder and CEO of ViaWest; and Trevor English, Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Business Planning

We know from our history that transformation is the result of opportunity and risk coming together. And for the past 45 years, Shaw has balanced these elements to deliver more value, more choice, and more connectivity to Canadians

When you operate in a dynamic, fast-paced environment, and continuing involving industry, careful consideration must be paid to ensure that we maximize value for all of our stakeholders by creating the proper mix of assets, strategic road map, and strong execution. Under Brad's leadership over the past several months, we've made announcements and unveiled product initiatives that will enable our customers to thrive in the connected world we live in

Yesterday, we announced the sale of Shaw Media to Corus, a significant milestone for both companies. In conjunction with our WIND announcement, these transactions position Shaw as a leading pure-play connectivity company with a strong growth profile

Similarly, the acquisition of Shaw Media by Corus creates a powerful integrated media and content company, with increased [scale], a strong mix of media properties, significant synergy potential and best-in-class management that is extremely well positioned to succeed and capitalize on opportunities the combination presents. Through this transaction, Shaw crystallizes an attractive value for Shaw Media, representing a significant return since the acquisition of Canwest in 2010

By maintaining a significant stake in the combined entity, Shaw could also benefit from the upside potential of a much stronger and better positioned Corus. The net proceeds from this sale will be used to fund the WIND acquisition

If we step back over a year ago to the discussions we were having internally on how to position Shaw for long-term growth, we knew wireless needed to be part of our future. The global telecom landscape was quickly evolving, resulting in the convergence between fixed and mobile data consumption. Data has emerged as the key driver for future growth

The acquisition of WIND was the right decision for Shaw for many reasons, including the substantial and growing wireless opportunity, the improved competitive position of our consolidated business, considering the complementary nature of WIND's operating footprint in western Canada, the addition of an experienced management team, and the immediate scale that it provides Shaw. Scale is an important attribute to succeed in today's competitive landscape, not only in wireless, but when you consider in content and media as well. The combination of Shaw Media and Corus provides the additional scale and growth opportunities needed to compete more effectively

These two transformative decisions were evaluated based on their stand-alone merits, and how to best maximize the value of Shaw's portfolio of assets. This long-term and strategic process led to these recent events, including the combination of Shaw Media with Corus, and our ongoing equity position in a bigger and stronger integrated media company. On behalf of Brad, I'd like to thank the members of the special committee of independent directors of Shaw, formed for the Shaw Media transaction, who invested considerable time and effort in the review and negotiation of this transaction

While these transactions were being evaluated and negotiated, we've not been sitting still when it comes to the rest of our Business. At the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas last week, we unveiled FreeRange TV, a breakthrough mobile viewing experience that provides exactly what customers are looking for in a mobile content experience, a visually appealing interface, easy-to-use navigation, and on-the-go access to the same programming choices they have at home. This marks the first major milestone in our agreement with Comcast, and is already available to our entire base of 2.6 million video customers. Throughout FY16, we'll be launching additional products as part of the Comcast and X1 partnership that are focused on significantly changing the video experience for our customers

Within our business network segment, we introduced additional products to grow -- for our growing portfolio of services, SmartWiFi and SmartSecurity. The entire Smart suite of products brings a power and capacity of managed Wi-Fi and network security solutions to our customers that were previously unavailable to the emerging small- and medium-size businesses. Built on the Cisco Meraki platform, Business Network Services provides innovative products with powerful features and straightforward management tools. We continue to be excited about the significant growth opportunities in the [SME] segment and our focus on increasing our market share

Business Infrastructure Services announced their $162 million acquisition of INetU, which closed on December 15. INetU is a customer-centric solutions provider for public, private and hybrid cloud environments, coupled with deep managed security and compliance services. This acquisition strengthens the existing managing cloud services offerings already provided by ViaWest, and it also adds additional scale with INetU's eastern US and European presence

We also officially opened the doors to our new Calgary data center in December, and are having success both with ViaWest and Shaw business customers. We continue to believe the growth profile of the data center business remains attractive and is an integral part of our growth strategy

When you bring all these elements together, it's clear we've got lots of hard work ahead, but it's a tremendous opportunity for us. JR, Jim and Brad have provided us a great foundation at Shaw from which to build upon as we enter the next phase of growth as a leading connectivity provider to residential and business customers

Now let me hand the call over to Vito to provide you with more details on the quarterly results

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; CFO   [3]

Thanks, Jay. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for joining us. Very exciting times here at Shaw, and we look forward to executing on Brad's strategic vision

Let me first address the Q1 results, and then I'll speak to the financial elements of the Shaw Media sale. Overall, we're pleased with the first-quarter results. Consolidated revenue increased over 2% to CAD1.42 billion, and operating income grew 3.3% to CAD626 million

Free cash flow for the quarter of CAD173 million is slightly below the comparable period, due mainly to the timing of some capital expenditures in the current quarter. Our consolidated operating margin also improved by 50 basis points to 44.1%, and net income was CAD218 million, or CAD0.43 a share, down by approximately CAD9 million over the comparable period, due primarily to higher amortization and income taxes

The Consumer division posted year-over-year revenue and operating income growth of 1.7% and 3.5%, respectively, due mainly to continued ARPU growth. This growth was partially offset by net RGU losses in the Consumer segment of almost 44,000, for which home phone accounted for more than half

Business Network Services, or BNS, contributed over 7% revenue growth to CAD136 million, and a 5% increase in operating income to CAD64 million for the quarter. We continue to invest in this opportunity through innovative products, increased sales force, and expanding the network. We remain very encouraged by the early results of SmartVoice, which many of you saw during our Investor Day in Denver, and with the launch of SmartWiFi and Security, we're excited to have additional Smart products available to our customers

Business Infrastructure Services reported quarterly revenue of CAD73 million and operating income of CAD25 million, representing growth of 33% and 19%, respectively. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange, revenue was up over 14% to $56 million, reflecting customer growth, building off their strong sales momentum in Q4

Also included in the current-quarter results is the addition of AppliedTrust, which contributed $2 million in revenue, continued Canadian dollar investment related to the Calgary data center of CAD1 million, as well as an adjustment to some employee-related costs of approximately CAD3 million. On a purely organic basis, the US business grew revenue and operating income by 11% and 12%, respectively, over the previous year

We are pleased that despite a challenging quarter, Media delivered operating income that was down less than 1%. Shaw Media's portfolio is strong. Global News maintains their number-one position in western Canada, and National Geographic and History hold a top spot in digital and entertainment specialty channel positions. We truly believe that the combination of Shaw Media assets with Corus will unlock significant potential, and we're excited to retain a pro forma equity ownership in Corus

We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, with total debt of approximately CAD5.7 billion, including ViaWest, resulting in a leverage metric of 2.3 times net debt to EBITDA. As of November 30, 2015, we have a cash balance of approximately CAD275 million, as well as access to over CAD500 million on our credit facility, therefore, providing us with significant liquidity and flexibility to address the CAD300 million floating rate notes due at the end of this month, as well as the CAD300 million 6.15% senior notes due in May

Let me now turn to yesterday's announcement. The sale of Shaw Media for CAD2.65 billion consists of a cash component of approximately CAD1.85 billion and an equity consideration of approximately CAD800 million, or roughly 71 million Corus Class B shares. Shaw has agreed to certain hold restrictions on the shares for a specified period of time, and will participate in Corus's dividend reinvestment plan

Our intention is to use the cash proceeds at closing to fund the previously announced WIND acquisition of CAD1.6 billion. However, as the timing of closing both transactions may vary, we have a CAD1.7 billion bridge facility that we can draw upon if required. Considering both the Shaw Media and WIND transactions on a pro forma basis, our net debt-to-EBITDA metric remains within our target range of 2 to 2.5 times

As this all relates to our FY16 guidance, Shaw will continue to operate its current businesses until such time as the WIND and Shaw Media transactions close, and we confirm at this time that there are no changes to our previously issued guidance. Operating income before restructuring costs and amortization is expected to range between flat to low single-digit growth over 2015. Capital investment on a consolidated basis is planned to be approximately CAD980 million, and free cash flow is anticipated to range between CAD665 and CAD680 million

In addition, the Board has approved our current annual dividend rate of CAD1.185 per Class B non-voting share. However, in the long term, we continue to believe our enhanced growth profile strengthens our ability to deliver on our commitment to growing our dividend

Thanks, Vito. On behalf of Brad and the entire leadership team, I want to conclude the call with a special thank you to our employees, who work tirelessly in support of all of our business pursuits, and to the Shaw Media employees for their passion that puts the need of Canadian viewers first. As the Shaw Media and Corus teams unite, there is no doubt that this combination creates a truly talented, best-in-class management team

We are pleased to confirm that Barb Williams has accepted a senior leadership role with Corus. Barb, your incredible work ethic, professionalism, and in-depth knowledge will be integral to Corus's ongoing success

We have a very exciting and busy year ahead, and we're off to a solid start. The future is ripe with opportunities for both Shaw and Corus, and we look forward to enhancing our leadership positions and delivering maximum shareholder value

Thank you. We would now like to open up the phones to answer any questions

 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [2]

Thank you, operator

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me today are members of our senior management team, including Jay Mehr, President, Shaw Communications; Vito Culmone, EVP and Chief Financial Officer; Nancy Phillips, CEO of ViaWest; and Alek Krstajic, EVP and President of WIND

Our second-quarter results mark the beginning of our transformation to a pure play connectivity company, and I am pleased to confirm that we have successfully closed both our previously announced transactions. The WIND acquisition closed on March 1, and we are excited to have Alek join us on the call today. I'm sure that there will be a few wireless-related questions, and we have tremendous confidence in the WIND team to help lead and grow our wireless business. At the end of Q2, WIND had approximately 980,000 subscribers, and the business is performing as we expected

Shaw Media officially became part of Corus Entertainment effective April 1, and I want to congratulate Doug and his team on the successful closing of this strategic acquisition. We look forward to the benefits of the combined pure play media company through our 37% equity stake in Corus

Before Vito reviews the financial results, I want to highlight some key developments over the last quarter. We are committed to providing choice and flexibility for our customers through innovation and value in our products and services. During the second quarter, we introduced a number of options for our video customers, including FreeRange TV. FreeRange was launched on January 6; and as of the end of March, over 210,000 customers activated with their account, with a total of over 360,000 devices

The FreeRange experience has generated a lot of positive conversations with our customers, and the ability to stream live TV, in particular, is the most popular feature on the app, generating approximately 70% usage. Last week, we launched the next stage of our next generation video road map by expanding FreeRange from mobile device to web access through any connected device, such as a laptop or smart TV. This marks another step towards beginning the video experience for our customers

Shaw was also one of the first TV providers to launch the skinny basic package that was mandated by the CRTC. Limited TV provides a basic TV package for CAD25, along with the ability to include small theme packs, so customers can personalize their TV experience. While there has been some interest in the skinny basic at launch, the majority of our customers still take a larger TV package, which allows us to truly differentiate and compete through value-added items such as FreeRange, Wi-Fi, shomi, and now CraveTV, as well as hardware options that are part of our two-year value plan that we have recently launched

We are committed to investing in our broadband infrastructure to lever our significant capital cost advantage and deliver superior Internet experiences to all of our customers. We have deployed next generation converged cable access platforms, or CCAP, in many of our major markets, dramatically expanded our number of Internet carriers, completed a record number of node splits this year, and have achieved our lowest ever network congestion levels. Our digital network upgrade is now complete in all major markets, with no analog video on any of those systems, and we will be fully complete everywhere this fall. All of these investments are in service of delivering a differentiated Internet experience for Shaw customers

I'll now turn it over to Vito to go through the financial results in greater detail. Vito?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc - EVP and CFO   [3]

Thanks, Brad, and hello to everyone on the call with us today

Q2 results will look a bit different than in the past, as Media has been reported as discontinued operations. Let me start with a consolidated picture, and then I will drill down into each section. Revenue growth from continuing operations, which consists of Consumer, BNS and BIS, increased 3% and 3.5% for the quarter- and year-to-date period, while operating income before restructuring costs and amortization, or EBITDA, increased by just under 1% in the quarter and 2.5% for the first half of 2016

Capital expenditures in the current quarter increased approximately 8% to CAD274 million. The year-over-year increase is attributed to upgrades and enhancements, including costs related to our TV Everywhere and NGB initiatives, additional bandwidth upgrades, as well as growth-related capital in BIS. Year-to-date capital investment of CAD519 million is also reflective of timing, as the back half of the year will moderate slightly

Consolidated free cash flow for the second quarter was CAD119 million, and is a combination of free cash flow from continuing operations in the amount of CAD90 million, plus discontinued operations of CAD29 million. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow totaled CAD291 million

Starting with Consumer results, revenue was largely flat over the previous year, while EBITDA decreased 1% in the quarter due to lower subscriber revenue combined with higher expenses, including the launch of FreeRange and increased network fees. For the first six months of the year, Consumer EBITDA has grown by 1.1%; Consumer RGUs decreased by approximately 42,000 in the quarter, as video and phone losses more than offset the gain in Internet

Business Network Services, or BNS, revenue and EBITDA were up 6% and 1.5% in the current quarter, due to continued customer growth. Excluding business satellite services from the results, revenue was up 7.7% and 8.2% for the quarter and year to date, respectively

The new smart products that we have recently launched continue to appeal to the [speed] market that we are focused on. SmartVoice is now installed for over 4,000 customers, and SmartWiFi has over 830 customers

Our current method of counting business subscribers is measured at the individual unit level, which was well suited for some of our traditional offerings. However, with the advent of our new cloud-based services, subscriber additions are recorded at the customer level versus the individual unit level. The result is that when a new customer subscribes to our services, the RGU impact is minimal, even as revenue increases, as it did for the current quarter. The success that we are experiencing as more and more business customers migrate to our new cloud-based services is not accurately captured in the RGU metric as currently defined, and is becoming less indicative of the performance in this division

Turning to Business Infrastructure Services, it delivered another solid quarter. Reported revenue and EBITDA were up 48% and 32%, respectively

Second-quarter results include the addition of both Applied Trust, and more recently INetU, which closed on December 15, 2015. Adjusting for the acquisitions, organic US dollar revenue and EBITDA increased by 10% and 11%, respectively. M&amp;A contributed $9 million to revenue in the quarter and $4 million to EBITDA; and on a Canadian dollar basis, foreign exchange improvements contributed CAD3.9 million to EBITDA. These positive variances were partially offset by approximately CAD3 million of additional adjustments that include Calgary data center costs and employee-related costs

Media, or discontinued operations as it's reported in the financial statements, reported revenue of CAD227 million and EBITDA of CAD71 million, which includes a CAD20 million favorable accounting treatment of program amortization. On a tax-adjusted basis, discontinued operations contributed CAD48 million to net income in the second quarter

Consolidated net income for the quarter of CAD164 million, or CAD0.32 per share, was down by approximately CAD4 million over a year ago. The current period includes transaction costs associated with the WIND acquisition, higher amortization, and that greater equity loss related to some of our investments, such as shomi

Over the past few months, there were a number of financing events related to the transactions, as well as some near-term debt maturities. During the quarter, we repaid the CAD300 million floating rate notes that matured on January 31 from balance sheet cash, and subsequently we raised CAD300 million in fixed five-year notes, at a very attractive rate of 3.15%. Upon closing of the WIND acquisition, we funded the CAD1.6 billion requirement through a combination of a CAD1 billion draw on our bridge facility, a further CAD300 million from our main [SCI] credit facility, which was also upsized from CAD1 billion to CAD1.5 billion during the quarter, and the remaining approximately CAD300 million from balance sheet cash

Effective April 1, the bridge and the main facility borrowings were repaid in full, with cash proceeds from the sale of Shaw Media. The only near-term maturity for calendar 2016 is the 6.15% CAD300 million notes due in May, and we expect to fund this obligation with existing balance sheet cash. Our balance sheet remained strong during the quarter, with leverage of approximately 2.4 times, almost CAD1 billion of liquidity available through our credit facility, as well as approximately CAD360 million of cash as at the end of Q2, prior to the previously discussed outflows/inflows related to the WIND acquisition and the Shaw Media sale

With the acquisition of WIND and the disposition of Shaw Media, we are updating our FY16 guidance. Shaw's revised FY16 guidance for Consumer, Business Network Services and Business Infrastructure Services combined is for operating income before restructuring costs and amortization to range between flat to low single-digit growth over FY15

Consolidated capital investment for Consumer, Business Network Services and Business Infrastructure Services combined is expected to be CAD995 million. The increase in expected capital spend reflects capital projects acquired in the INetU transaction and the effect of foreign exchange rates relative to plan. We expect to provide consolidated FY17 guidance, including WIND, in our normal course

With that, Brad, I'll hand it back to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc - CEO   [4]

Great. Thanks, Vito

2016 is an exciting year, with lots of changes and opportunities for Shaw. As we make our way through the process and begin to execute on our strategic plan, we will keep a sharp focus on operational efficiencies and ensure that we continue to build on delivering an exceptional customer experience

Thank you for joining us this afternoon, and we'll now turn it over to the operator to open up for Q&amp;A

Operator   [1]

Welcome to the Shaw Communications third-quarter FY16 conference call. Today's call will be hosted by Mr. Brad Shaw, CEO of Shaw Communications

(Operator Instructions)
 Before we begin, management would like to remind listeners that comments made during today's call will include forward-looking information, and there are risks that actual results could differ materially. Please refer to the Company's publicly filed documents for more details on assumptions and risks

Mr. Shaw, I would now like to turn the call over to you. Please go ahead

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [2]

Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me today are members of the senior management team, including Jay, Vito, Alek and Nancy

As everyone knows, we closed the acquisition of Wind on March 1, and Q3 now includes Wireless in our financial and operating results. We are excited to have Wireless as part of our portfolio, and capitalizing on the numerous opportunities that lie ahead

During the quarter, we exceeded 1 million Wireless subscribers, and we made significant enhancements to our Wireless network. In June, we completed the 3G upgrade in all of our markets, and this has significantly improved the current customer experience

Our planning and design work related to our LTE network is well under way, and we expect the upgrade to be complete by the end of FY17. By bringing together our fiber, WiFi and Wireless assets, we are creating an enhanced connectivity experience through a converged network that is efficient, and has sustainable cost and capital advantage

Everyone is well aware of the devastation that occurred around Fort McMurray and the surrounding area due to the wildfires this spring. Fortunately for Shaw, we did not suffer any significant service interruptions or any material damage to our network. Clearly, our customers were not as fortunate, as they were displaced for a month, and some of them for much longer, as they look to rebuild their homes

During this time, we put our best foot forward and provided all residents, regardless of them being a Shaw customer or not, access to our Shaw Go WiFi networks so they could stay connected to their loved ones. We also provided a credit to all customers for the month of May so they did not have to worry about the expenses during this difficult and emotional time

As we supported the community through donations raised by employees and matched by the Company, while Shaw had approximately 35 employees in the Fort McMurray area, I want to take the opportunity to express my sincere thank you to all Shaw employees that went above and beyond for their fellow colleagues and for the Company. The passion and dedication of our staff is truly amazing, and it is the reason why we are the strong and resilient Company that we are today. We are a Company that cares deeply about our employees and our communities

During the remainder of 2016 and throughout FY17, we will continue to deliver on our strategic initiatives. As part of our network and infrastructure roadmap, we have completed our digital network upgrade, doubled our network capacity, and we continue to roll out DOCSIS 3.1. Our network has never been in better shape, and congestion is at an all-time low

Today, we are excited to launch an unrivaled, ultra broadband product that we have branded WideOpen Internet 150. The 150 megabyte service is available to our entire footprint, and showcases the strength of our hybrid fibre coax network and the previous investments we have made

Fast and affordable internet service is in demand, and we think customers will find tremendous value with this new offer, as we continue to build on a path towards 1 gigabyte speeds and beyond. We will also be launching the X1 set-top box later this year, and plan to have it available across our footprint by the end of FY17. We will also complete our LTE upgrade by the end of FY17, which will provide our customers with a much improved Wireless experience

I will now turn it over to Vito to go through the financial results in greater detail, and will provide some additional context with respect to FY16 and preliminary FY17 capital guidance. Vito?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO   [3]

Thanks, Brad. Good morning to all of you for joining us on the call this morning

At a consolidated level, Q3 reported revenue and EBITDA was up 13% and 5.3%, respectively, as the current quarter includes a full three-month contribution from WIND. Excluding the results for the Wireless division, revenue increased 1.4%, while EBITDA was roughly flat over the comparable period. Capital spending in the quarter of CAD286 million increased over the prior period, as it includes CAD51 million related to Wireless spending

Consolidated free cash flow for the third quarter was CAD182 million, and is a combination of free cash flow from continuing operations in the amount of CAD152 million, which includes approximately CAD14 million in dividends received from Corus, plus discontinued operations of CAD30 million. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow totaled CAD473 million

Consolidated net income for the quarter of CAD704 million, or CAD1.44 per share, has a number of one-time items that I will walk through. The increase to net income in the current period is a result of higher EBITDA, including Wireless, and a CAD650 million net of tax gain on the sale of our media assets, partially offset by some additional non-recurring items, such as transaction costs related to WIND of approximately CAD12 million; restructuring costs of CAD24 million related to the initiation of a multi-year efficiency program; a CAD10 million equity loss from our investment in Corus; and impairment losses related to investments and the tracking business, which, in aggregate, total CAD88 million

Turning to the individual business units, let's start with our newest division, Wireless. We reported revenue of CAD132 million; and for informational purposes, this represents an increase of 24% versus the prior year. Wireless EBITDA of CAD29 million, or a 22% margin, was strong

Alek and team are doing a tremendous job moving forward on the network upgrade, which is translating into immediate improvements for our customers, including reduced churn. In the quarter, we spent CAD51 million on Wireless CapEx, with a significant component of this related to the CAD250 million LTE upgrade. We remain on track to complete the full LTE overlay of existing markets, which covers a population of approximately [15 million] by the end of FY17

In the quarter, we added approximately 22,000 net new Wireless customers, and the mix of postpaid continues to improve, representing over 64% of our total 1 million Wireless customers. Blended ARPU increased to CAD36.30, and we expect continued ARPU expansion as network quality improves. I would encourage our listeners to review the Q3 MD&amp;A, financial statements, and related notes to the financial statements for further details regarding the accounting policies associated with the reporting of our new Wireless division

Turning to Consumer, third-quarter revenue was down 1.4% to CAD935 million, and EBITDA declined 2.7% to CAD427 million, compared to the prior year. The contributing factors to this year-over-year decline are largely due to lower RGUs, fewer on-demand buys, as Q3 last year included a very successful pay-per-view boxing event, and the one-month credit that we provided to all customers in Fort McMurray and area that were impacted by the fire. This credit resulted in a revenue impact of approximately CAD3 million for the month of May

Consumer RGU losses of 47,000 are in line with the comparable quarter, but it is worth noting that this includes approximately 5,400 related to Fort McMurray and a tougher economic climate, particularly in Alberta compared to a year ago. Broadband results, in particular, were impacted in the quarter by a large number of single-play internet disconnects, led primarily by students. However, we are confident and excited that our WideOpen Internet 150 product, along with the introduction of X1 set-top box later this year, which Brad discussed earlier, will gain momentum in the market as we move into FY17

Business Network Services, or BNS, revenue and EBITDA were up almost 4% and 5% in the current quarter, due to continued customer growth. Excluding business satellite services from the results, revenue was up 5.1% and EBITDA increased 8.6% in the quarter, respectively

In June, we launched a third managed cloud-based solution for the SME market called SmartSecurity. Our strategy and focus on the SME market by providing our business customers with enterprise-grade solutions is working. The sales funnel continues to grow, and we remain excited about the long-term growth profile of this very important segment

Business Infrastructure Services continues to deliver steady growth, with reported revenue and EBITDA up 36.5% to CAD86 million and 32% to CAD33 million, respectively. On a US dollar organic basis, ViaWest continues to deliver double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth. The team continues to work on the new Plano, Texas, data center, and expects to open this facility in October. Customer demand for our hybrid suite of services continues to be strong, and we remain confident in the growth opportunities that exist in this space, as Business Infrastructure Services is a core element of our overall growth strategy

During the quarter, we launched a multi-stage efficiency program, resulting in the one-time charge of CAD24 million in Q3. We expect that the actions we have taken in this quarter, along with additional initiatives planned in early FY17, will result in approximately CAD75 million in annualized savings. Cost discipline has always been a focus at Shaw, and we have an opportunity to become an even more efficient organization as we transform into an enhanced connectivity company

In terms of guidance, we forecast that our FY16 operating income before restructuring and amortization on a consolidated basis to range between flat to low single-digit growth as compared to FY15. In regards to consolidated capital, investment in FY16 is expected to be CAD1.2 billion, including WIND

In addition, we are introducing preliminary FY17 consolidated capital to be approximately CAD1.3 billion, which includes a CAD250 million LTE spend. And we will provide additional details regarding FY17 guidance in conjunction with the release of our fourth-quarter results

I will just make a few final comments on our balance sheet, which remains strong and within our target range of 2 to 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA, providing us with ample flexibility. In May, we repaid the 6.15% CAD300 million senior notes with balance sheet cash; and at the end of Q3, we had approximately CAD320 million in cash on hand and CAD1 billion of liquidity available to us under our credit facility

With that, I will turn it back to Brad for his closing remarks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [4]

Thanks, Vito

We continue to execute on the strategic plan that we outlined in connection with the transactions we closed earlier this year, and we're making steady, continuous progress. Our infrastructure advantage is clear, and we will rely heavily on this going into FY17 as we complete a number of initiatives, including the X1 set-top box rollout, ultra broadband Internet speeds, completion of the LTE upgrade, and additional initiatives related to customer service improvements. We have an incredibly focused management team, and we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout this journey

Thank you for joining us this morning, and we will now turn it to the operator to open it up for Q&amp;A session

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Shaw Communications' fourth-quarter and full-year FY16 conference call. Today's call will be hosted by Mr. Brad Shaw, CEO of Shaw Communications

(Operator Instructions)
 Before we begin, Management would like to remind listeners that comments made during today's call will include forward-looking information and there are risks that actual results could differ materially.

Mr. Shaw, I will now turn the call over to you

 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [2]

Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me today are members of our Senior Management Team including Jay, Vito, Alek and Nancy. 2016 was a transformative year and represents a very deliberate pivot in the strategic direction for Shaw towards long-term sustainable growth

The acquisition of WIND provided a critical piece to our converged network and growth strategy as customer demand for a truly mobile product continues to increase. We completed this transformational shift with the sale of Shaw Media assets on April 1, crystallizing substantial value creation since initially acquiring the assets in 2010. We believe the strategic realignment of our asset base positions us well to compete and grow in the future. We exit 2016 with a solid foundation in place, necessary to execute on our strategic initiatives in FY17 and beyond. Key among these initiatives is to increase the revenue and operating growth profile for Shaw

Through investments we have made in FY16, our growth services comprised of wireless, BNS, and BIS are delivering solid results and our converged network strategy will position us to provide exceptional customer experiences alongside strategic partnerships with best-in-class technology providers. We have solidified our partnerships with the likes of Comcast, Cisco, Nokia and Broadsoft, enabling us to introduce unique and compelling platforms to both our consumer and business customers

We are excited about our strategic partnership with Comcast and Cisco and in FY16 we launched FreeRange, our TV e-application, representing the first milestone in our NGV roadmap. We continue to work closely with Comcast in the deployment of the X1 video service, which will be deployed across our footprint throughout FY17

Nokia is our single source provider of our wireless network equipment, where we secured a very attractive fixed-rate contract on the wireless LTE upgrade that is currently ongoing. And we have partnered with Broadsoft and Meraki to support our new managed business product offerings, such as SmartVoice, SmartWiFi and SmartSecurity. In August, we launched WideOpen Internet 150

This ultra broadband service is available to almost 90% of our footprint and capitalizes on our network competitive advantage. The launch of Internet 150 during the quarter helped contribute to our Q4 Internet results. Consolidated RGUs, including wireless net adds of approximately CAD40,000 was positive as we added over 8,000 RGUs in the quarter. Considering the wireless opportunity in front of us, initial success of WideOpen 150 and excitement and anticipation regarding the introduction of our XFINITY TV product, combined with our growing percentage of customers taking our two-year value plans

We clearly have momentum heading into FY17 with further opportunities to grow RGUs and reduce churn. I will now turn it over to Vito to go through the financial results and provide more details regarding FY17 guidance

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP and CFO   [3]

Thank you, Brad. Indeed it has been a very busy and exciting year for us. The reported consolidated results for the quarter include revenue of CAD1.3 billion, up 15.5%, and EBITDA of CAD549 million, up 4.6% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusting to exclude wireless results, revenue in the quarter for the combined consumer BNS and BIS divisions was up 2.2%, while EBITDA declined 1% compared to a year ago

Looking at the full-year results, consolidated revenue of CAD4.9 billion increased 8.9%, and EBITDA increased 3.8% to CAD2.1 billion. Excluding wireless and media for the full year, revenue increased 2.6% and EBITDA increased 0.9%, compared to FY15

Diving into the divisional details. Consumer revenue of CAD938 million in the quarter was comparable to the prior year, while EBITDA of CAD418 million declined 3.7%. For the full year, consumer revenue of CAD3.75 billion was also compared all to FY15 while EBITDA decreased 1.1% to CAD1.67 billion

Flat top-line results, due to RGU losses essentially offsetting the impact of the rate increases, combined with increased operating expenses associated mainly with the NGV and programming costs are the primary drivers for both the quarter and for the full-year consumer results. BNS results for the quarter include revenue and EBITDA of CAD140 million and CAD70 million, up 5.3% and 4.5%, respectively, over the prior year. Full-year reported revenue and EBITDA grew 5.4% and 3.5% to CAD548 million and CAD265 million due primarily to consumer growth

Core revenue and EBITDA are both up approximately 7% in FY16, which excludes the Tracking and Broadcast businesses. Strong wireless results in the quarter include revenue of CAD148 million and EBITDA of CAD29 million. Compared to Q3, revenue is up 12% and ARPU, in the wireless group, increased over 3% to CAD37.40

For the six-month period included in our FY16 results, Wireless contributed CAD280 million in revenue and CAD59 million in EBITDA and we expect the Wireless division to continue to drive growth in FY17. BIS continues to deliver healthy and predictable results. Reported revenue and EBITDA for the quarter was CAD86 million and CAD32 million Compared to Q3, revenue was flat while EBITDA declined approximately CAD1 million, or 4.5%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange

The softness in Q4 compared to Q3 is driven by two factors. One is the anticipated departure of a single tenant data center and, secondly, seasonal increase in utility costs. It is important to note that on a full-year basis, business infrastructure services delivered organic revenue and EBITDA growth of approximately 12%, as customer demand continues

Consolidated capital expenditures in the quarter and for the full year were CAD386 million and CAD1.2 billion. The increase in the current quarter compared to a year ago is due primarily to the addition of wireless investments of approximately CAD70 million in Q4. Free cash flow in the quarter was CAD9 million and CAD482 million for the 12-month period, which includes approximately CAD132 million in cash flow from discontinued operations

We delivered net income in the quarter of CAD154 million, or the CAD0.31 per share, which is a decrease over the prior year due primarily to a nonrecurring gain on the sale of the Spectrum licenses recorded in Q4 2015. Net income for the full year was CAD1.2 billion, or CAD2.51 per share compared to CAD1.80 per share in FY15. The increase in the current year was driven primarily by the gain on the sale of the Media division, partially offset by various other nonoperating losses

Let me take a moment, please, and address Shomi. As many of you are aware, on September 26, 2016, subsequent to our August 31 year end, Shomi announced that it would be winding down operations effective November 30, 2016

FY15 and FY16, we have recognized total equity losses of CAD10 million. Further, in Q3 of the FY16, you recall we reported an additional CAD51 million impairment. In the months to come, we expect to incur additional costs in relation to the wind down of up to CAD120 million as noted in our subsequent event note. An up-to-date provision for these costs will be reflected in our Q1 FY17 results

Let me now turn to the particulars of our FY17 guidance. Our consolidated capital guidance as noted in July, when we provided our Q3 results remains unchanged at CAD1.3 billion

The increase over FY16 reflects the impact of a full year of wireless investment. We are introducing consolidated EBITDA guidance to range between CAD2.125 billion and CAD2.175 billion. This EBITDA guidance reflects the expectation of healthy revenue gains across all of our business units, coupled with required strategic investments with a view to providing long-term benefits

From a free cash flow perspective, our FY17 guidance is to exceed CAD400 million. As previously discussed, FY17 is another year where we will continue to make organizational investments and focus on execution. However, our long-term strategy to deliver operating earnings, free cash flow and dividend growth remains our guiding principle. With that, Brad, back to you

 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [4]

Thanks, Vito. Before we take any questions, I wanted to knowledge our employees and customers that were impacted by the devastating fires in Fort McMurray earlier this year. We all came together and supported this tragedy and as the city rebuilds and recovers, Shaw is proud to stand with the community, our customers and our families. In closing, I also want to say a sincere thank you to all Shaw employees for their hard work and devotion over this past year

As we turn the corner and start a new growth chapter here at Shaw, we will continue to work towards many exciting initiatives in FY17 that are geared toward building a stronger Shaw for the future for all of our stakeholders. Thank you for joining us this afternoon and we will now turn it back to the operator to open for Q&amp;A session

Welcome to Shaw Communications' first quarter FY17 conference call. Today's call will be hosted by Mr. Brad Shaw, CEO of Shaw Communications

(Operator Instructions)
 Before we begin, management would like to remind listeners that comments made during today's call will include forward-looking information and there are risks that actual results could differ materially. Please refer to the Company's publicly filed documents for more information on assumption and risks. Mr. Shaw, I would now like to turn the call over to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [2]

Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me today are members of our senior management team, including Jay, Vito, Alek and Nancy

We enter FY17 with momentum, as we now have the diversified assets to deliver long-term growth and enhanced connectivity for our customers. We are pleased with the progress and execution of our strategic plan

During the first quarter, we continue to see strength in BIS and BNS and improving customer wireline results, which are supported by the investments we made in our infrastructure, the introduction of two-year value plans, and a full quarter of our WideOpen Internet 150 offering. Further to this, we continue to enhance our wireline network and are on target to complete our DOCSIS 3.1 upgrade by the end of FY17. All these initiatives lead to a strong quarter of internet RGU additions of 17,000 new broadband customers

As many of you know, yesterday we unveiled Shaw BlueSky TV. Our new best-in-class premium television product is now available for customers in Calgary and other Shaw markets in the coming months. Shaw BlueSky TV sets the highest standard for Canadian television viewing

We are proud to pioneer the Comcast technology in the Canadian market and are privileged to draw upon the years of R&amp;D that Comcast has invested to create this leading edge entertainment platform. BlueSky TV brings forward more product and feature benefits than any other television service available in Canada. Its voice control remote makes it easier than ever to find and discover content, dramatically changing the way our customers experience TV

In the quarter, we remained focused on the execution of our long term strategic wireless initiatives, which included three key milestones. First, in November we rebranded Wind to Freedom Mobile. Second, we began the rollout of our LTE-Advanced network upgrade in the key markets of central Toronto and Vancouver and are currently tracking ahead of schedule, as we look to complete the network enhancements by Fall 2017. Third, we introduced the Freedom Wi-Fi trial, which allows Freedom Mobile customers to connect to over 65,000 Shaw Go WiFi hotspots across Alberta and BC

In support of our multi-year wireless strategic plan, we recognized that there would be periods of volatility as we focused on our long-term objectives, including our branding and LTE network enhancements. We also recognized that there would be periods of heightened competitive activity that will impact quarterly trends

I will now turn it over to Vito to go through financial results for the quarter. Vito?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - EVP &amp; CFO   [3]

Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon to all of you joining us on the call. The reported consolidated results for the quarter include revenue of CAD1.31 billion, up 14.9%, and EBITDA of CAD539 million, up 6.1% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusting to exclude wireless results, revenue in the quarter for the combined Consumer, BNF and BIS divisions was up 2.8%, while EBITDA was roughly flat compared to a year ago

Looking at the divisional details. Consumer revenue of CAD947 million in the quarter was up 0.4%, while EBITDA of CAD405 million declined 3.3% compared to the prior year. Improvements in revenue were driven by annual rate adjustments, growth in internet RGUs and a year-over-year decrease in promotional costs

BNS results for the quarter include revenue and EBITDA of CAD144 million and CAD72 million respectively, up 5.9% and 12.5% respectively, over the prior year. Wireless results in the quarter include revenue of CAD138 million and EBITDA of CAD30 million. Compared to the fourth quarter of FY16, revenue is down 6.4% and EBITDA is up 2%. Results reflect our focus on the launch of Freedom Mobile, the rollout of our LTE-Advanced network and heightened competitive activity in the period

BIS reported revenue and EBITDA for the quarter was CAD90 million and CAD32 million, up 23% and 28% respectively, over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the December 2015 acquisition of INetU and continued customer growth

Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, revenue increased by 21.3%, to $67 million; and excluding the effect of INetU, revenue increased by 5.6%, to $59 million for the quarter. It's important to note that while organic growth is softer this quarter, we still expect approximately double digit organic growth for full-year revenue and EBITDA in our BIS division

Consolidated capital expenditures in the quarter were CAD290 million. The increase in the current quarter compared to a year ago is due primarily to the addition of wireless investments of approximately CAD64 million in the quarter

Free Cash Flow of CAD158 million for the quarter decreased from CAD173 million a year ago, primarily as a result of a reduction in free cash flow from discontinued operations in the amount of CAD74 million, following the sale of the Media division in 2016 and the addition of wireless

We delivered net income in the quarter of CAD89 million, or CAD0.18 per share, which is a decrease over the prior year, due primarily to the non-recurring provision in the amount of CAD107 million related to the wind down of our investment in Shomi. In addition, a decrease in income from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the amount of CAD80 million due to the sale of the former media division in the third quarter of the prior year, which is partially offset by the equity income of CAD27 million in the quarter from our investment in Corus

Before turning the call back to Brad, I wanted to briefly discuss the change in accounting policy related to the calculation of deferred taxes on intangible assets with an indefinite useful life that impacted our statements of financial position. This change had no business or operational impact and no impact to income or cash flow in the quarter. Please refer to note 2 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for disclosure relating to the change in accounting policy and the impacts of the restatements. With that, Brad, I'll hand it back to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Brad Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO   [4]

Thanks, Vito. We look forward to a strong FY17 and maintain a continued focus on delivering long-term growth to shareholders and a best-in-class connectivity experience for our customers

We have never had a better set of assets nor a stronger team to lead us. We stand on a platform that is ready to hold the weight of the next generation of Shaw as we build for the future. I would like to extend a sincere thank you to all the Shaw employees for their efforts and commitment in helping us achieve our Q1 results

Before we take any questions, I want to say, we know many people here in western Canada and elsewhere have endured hard times recently and we are humbled that many continue to welcome Shaw services into their homes, as staying connected becomes even more important. Thank you for joining us this afternoon and we will now turn it back to the Operator to open the Q&amp;A session

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Shaw Communications' Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Conference Call. Today's call will be hosted by Mr. Brad Shaw, CEO of Shaw Communications. (Operator Instructions) The conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)
 Before we begin, management would like to remind listeners that comments made during today's call will include forward-looking information, and there are risks that actual results could differ materially. Please refer to the company's publicly filed documents for more details on assumptions and risks

Mr. Shaw, I will now turn the call over to you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Non Independent Director   [2]

Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me today are members of our senior management team, including Jay, Vito, Nancy, and we're also joined this morning by Glen Campbell, Senior Vice President, Wireless Planning

We are pleased this morning to report solid financial results for the second quarter. Our performance highlights our leadership team commitment to the execution of our long-term strategic plan and the historical and ongoing capital investments required to be a leading Canadian connectivity company, which is delivering exceptional products and services to our customers across the country

We have never had more to do but remain disciplined at ensuring we prioritize flawless execution and deliver results for all of our stakeholders. Through our network investments including the rollout of DOCSIS 3.1 and development of best-in-class partnerships with global leaders such as Comcast, Cisco Meraki, BroadSoft and Nokia we have remained focused on providing our customers with more value, enhanced experiences and choices

On April 5, we launched BlueSky TV to all Shaw markets in Western Canada, and this represents an important milestone for our company. With its voice-activated remote and easy-to-access content, BlueSky TV completely transforms how customers experience television. BlueSky TV is more than just a new set-top box but rather a flexible and innovative in-the-home platform that will adapt over time and enhance our customers' viewing experience and connected life

In the second quarter, the execution of our strategic plan was generated -- has generated strong results, largely driven by our wireline competitive advantage. In Consumer, we have the best quarterly subscriber performance in 5 years, showing an improvement of 36,000 RGUs year-over-year. This quarter, we demonstrated that our 2-year value plans, flexible video packaging options and WideOpen Internet 150 are resonating with customers in the market

Shaw WideOpen Internet 150 is now available in 99.2% of our footprint. This means that today, we are able to offer approximately 3x faster speeds to virtually all Western Canadians versus our direct competitors across our footprint

Within our business segments, including BNS and BIS, we continue to see strong organic growth driven by sustained customer demand for our products and services

In Wireless, we delivered solid results, adding 33,000 new customers in the quarter. However, competition remains intense. And as we look to build the business for the long-term benefit of our shareholders, we would expect to experience some periods of volatility. We remain committed to building a wireless offering that is an affordable option to more Canadians

Before my closing remarks, I will now turn the call over to Vito to go through the financial results for the second quarter. Vito?

Vito Culmone,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CFO and EVP   [3]

Thanks, Brad, and good morning to all of you for joining us this morning. The reported consolidated results for the quarter include revenue of $1.3 billion, up 13.3%; and EBITDA of $540 million, up 7.6% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusting to exclude the Wireless results, revenue in the quarter for the combined Consumer, BNS and BIS divisions was up 1.1%, while EBITDA was up 1.8% compared to a year ago

Looking at the divisional details. Consumer revenue of $933 million in the quarter was down 0.1%, while EBITDA of $403 million was flat compared to the prior year. In Consumer, our focus is on attracting customers into our ecosystem, providing them with the best experience through leading products such as WideOpen 150 and BlueSky TV and ensuring price certainty through multiyear value plans to deliver long-term growth and stability for our business

BNS results for the quarter include revenue and EBITDA of $146 million and $73 million, up 6.6% and 10.6%, respectively, over the prior year. Excluding legacy satellite services, our core business revenue increased 8.6% in the current quarter

Wireless results in the quarter include revenue of $140 million and EBITDA of $29 million. Compared to the first quarter of fiscal '17, revenue is up 1.5% and EBITDA is flat. Wireless financials reflect the results of RGUs gained in the quarter, partially offset by a slight decrease in blended ARPU and increased commercial costs associated with the branding transition to Freedom Mobile and other promotional-related costs

BIS reported revenue and EBITDA for the quarter of $91 million and $35 million, up 2.2% and 6.1%, respectively, over the prior year. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange in U.S. dollars, revenue and EBITDA increased by 7.7% and 11.4%, respectively

Consolidated CapEx in the quarter was $297 million. The increased CapEx in the current quarter compared to a year ago is due primarily to the addition of wireless investments of approximately $53 million, offset partially by reductions in each of the Consumer, BNS and BIS divisions

Free cash flow of $147 million for the quarter increased from $119 million a year ago primarily as a result of the higher EBITDA, Corus dividends and lower cash taxes, partially offset by free cash flow from the former Media division and higher CapEx for Wireless

We delivered net income in the quarter of $147 million or $0.30 per share, which is an increase over the prior year net income from continuing operations, primarily due to equity income from our investment in Corus and nonoperating losses incurred in the prior year

On a full year basis, there is no change to our fiscal '17 guidance for CapEx, EBITDA or free cash flow. In the quarter, we also completed a $300 million 10-year senior note offering to capitalize on attractive market conditions. The net proceeds of this offering, together with cash on hand, were used to repay the $400 million principal amount of senior notes due March 2, 2017

With that, I'll hand the call back to Brad for closing comments

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Non Independent Director   [4]

Thanks, Vito. As noted in our second quarter news release this morning and as per our transition plans, Alek Krstajic is stepping down as CEO of Freedom Mobile. Over the past year, under Alek's leadership, Freedom Mobile has achieved significant milestones, including activating Freedom's LTE-Advanced network and establishing the Freedom Mobile brand for value-conscious Canadians. This morning, we are pleased to welcome Paul McAleese as Chief Operating Officer, Freedom Mobile. Paul will guide Freedom's operations and continued growth going forward and will be instrumental regarding the integration of our wireless operations within Shaw. Paul brings more than 2 decades of experience in mobile communications from the U.S., U.K. and Canada, and we are excited to welcome him to the Freedom Mobile and the Shaw leadership team

On a personal note, Alek is a builder, a value creator and always brings an entrepreneurial spirit to everything he does. It is these qualities that we have always admired. We thank Alek for all of his contributions and his stewardship since we completed the acquisition and wish him all the best. Alek is with us this morning on the phone, and we'd like to invite him to say a few words before we provide closing comments. And both Jay and I will be able to address any questions regarding our wireless business during the Q&amp;A session to follow. Alek?

Aleksander Krstajic,  Shaw Communications Inc. - President of Wind and EVP of Wind   [5]

Brad, thank you very much. Look, I want to -- a special thanks, Brad, to you and the entire executive team, Jim and Peter and Vito, Zoran, Trevor, Nancy and especially Jay. You guys have made this transition after purchasing the company and this last year really all about teamwork. I have never felt more welcome, and so I want to say thank you. I'm very proud of some of the things you mentioned, what the team did over this last year, creating the Freedom brand, the accelerated LTE network, and quite frankly, this last quarter of 33,000 net adds and building the momentum back in the business after launching both the new brand and LTE. So very proud of that

It is time for me to move on, and I'm excited about that. Obviously, I'm going to remain a -- for me a significant shareholder. And I'm very excited about my old and good and close friend, Paul McAleese, coming in as COO. Paul and I knew each other from 20, 30 years ago from the Rogers days. He's a proven operator. But at his core, he's a marketer, and I think he's the best marketer in North America. So I think the business is left in really solid hands. And once again, I thank you for all the kindness and the way you've made us feel this past year. All the best

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bradley S. Shaw,  Shaw Communications Inc. - CEO and Non Independent Director   [6]

Thanks, Alek. In closing, we look forward to carrying the momentum we are delivering throughout the remainder of fiscal '17. We are focused on delivering long-term growth to our shareholders and a best-in-class connectivity experience for our customers

I would like to extend a sincere thank you to all Shaw employees for helping us execute and deliver on our strategic plan. In particular, I would like to highlight the mass launch of a new service like BlueSky TV is no easy undertaking. It's because of our committed employees that we were able to accomplish this very important milestone in Shaw's history

Thank you for joining us this morning, and we would now turn it back to the operator to open for Q&amp;A
