0     -1   4264  -1_growth_year_quarter_business        [growth, year, quarter, business, expect, second, pleased, continue, continued, fourth]  [Our broadcast business was down only about 10% sequentially in Q4. Ramps at major new customers partially filled in the gap created by anticipated slowing in Samsung demand. For the year, our audio business was up double digits, with both the handset and consumer audio product lines posting solid growth. For 2010, we anticipate unit growth for our FM tuners and handsets, driven by the increased tax rate, even allowing for minor share growth and continued ASP pressure resulting in our handset revenue being slightly down for the year. We expect our consumer audio business to continue to flourish, with AM/FM revenue doubling again and with the benefit of a full year of revenue from our new major consumer audio customer. The net effect will be another solid growth year for audio in 2010, Three factors had a negative impact on Services performance in the quarter. The first was the economic environment, which contributed to lower demand for equipments, add, moves and changes, as well as for time and materials or training. The second factor was a loss of a major value\n [Gap In Audio] \n services [Inaudible]  , as I\n [Gap In Audio] \n described on last quarter's call. We saw a partial affect in the first quarter and the full affect in the quarter just ended. The third was a renegotiation of an agreement with a major dealer, as I mentioned on last call. That agreement had been due to expire in June of this year; we negotiated an extension, at a lower monthly rate for a longer term. Some impact of this in Q2 and we'll see a slight additional impact in Q3. Operating income for this segment was lower than the first fiscal quarter by $14 million, or nine percent, and this reduction was driven primarily by lower sales volume as reflected in my prior comments. Looking at factors affecting our core business as a whole in the quarter, we're encouraged by signs that the U.S. economy appears to be stabilizing. Therefore, we expect to see a slight economic improvement in Q3, continuing into Q4. Turning now from our core business to the Econ-Activities Solutions segment, revenues were up 5.1 percent sequentially, although still down significantly from the year ago quarter. Our SYSTEMAX product revenues led with 11.7 percent sequential growth. Revenues from our exchange max and cabinet products for service providers declined only five million dollars sequentially, marking the smallest sequential decline in these product revenues since the second quarter of fiscal 2000. International revenues for the segment grew sequentially, both on an absolute basis and as a percent of total segment revenue. Con activity revenues were flat in the U.S. but revenues grew 16 percent sequentially in AMIA (ph) , and 62 percent in Cala (ph) , fueled in a doubling in SYSTEMAX sales in Latin America. SYSTEMAX business around the world is encouraging and gives us reason to think that enterprise spending for structured cabling solutions may be showing signs of recovery, Now let's move on to Slide #24, and we'll wrap up this quarter. My hope is that this update gives you insight into our very healthy core business, which allows us to continue to grow at stunning double-digit rates while also enabling us a plant the seeds for future growth. To summarize the quarter, we delivered adjusted cash EPS of $0.85, a 16% year-over-year increase in our weakest quarter of the year. EFT delivered exceptional results while also adding 874 new ATMs in advance of the busier travel season. And it had constant currency up income growth of 54%. Epay's double-digit earnings growth resulted from continuing -- continued expansion of our digital media product. Here, constant currency up income growth of 15% over prior year. And finally, Money Transfer continued to deliver strong earnings growth from expansion in both the physical and digital channel. Here, we had constant currency up income growth of 22%. We successfully issued $525 million worth of a 0.75% interest convertible bond to essentially refinance our 1.5% convertible bond. And we had generation of free cash flow, which continues to strengthen our balance sheet. And finally, we expect second quarter adjusted EPS to be approximately $1.69 assuming consistent foreign exchange rates. And with that, we'd be happy to take questions.

Inflation added approximately $1.1 million and our rightsizing and cost takeout initiatives reduced third quarter SG&amp;A by $2.9 million in continuing operations. SG&amp;A as a percent of sales was 10.9% in the third quarter 2007. This is down from 11.3% sequentially in the second quarter 2007 and down significantly from 13.0% in the third quarter last year, Going into the revenue base, or the revenue for the quarter, net revenues were $36 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 compared to $36.1 million -- (technical difficulty) -- as opposed to $36.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, so basically the revenue was flat, compared to the first quarter of the year. This represents about the fourth quarter in a row where the revenue has been stabilized. Compared to the second quarter of 2002, revenue was down by about $3.2 million, which represents the decline that we suffered from the automotive sector, On a GAAP basis, operating income was 2.5 million for the quarter, up 32 percent from last year's fourth quarter and 8.3 million for the year, up 73 percent from 4.8 million in 2003. On a GAAP basis, net income was 1.2 million for the quarter, up 76 percent from 707,000 last year. For the year, net income had 3.2 million, up from an $80,000 loss last year]

During the last fiscal year, we opened 12 new yards, and we expanded 50 -- 15 existing locations. In total, we added almost 700 acres of capacity. Our expansion activity has continued into this quarter and will continue throughout the year. During the quarter, we opened 2 new yards, 1 in Exeter, Rhode Island and 1 in Andrews, Texas. In addition, we expanded 7 existing locations and opened 1 sublot. In total, we added approximately 226 acres of new capacity, Of course this will ultimately depend on the strength of the fourth quarter, the actual level of pest pressure, and planted acres. In closing, despite more challenging market conditions in 2005, we expect higher sales and increased profitability this year. Our focus on key products and market segments coupled with our low cost sourcing strategy, productivity initiatives, and growth plans have allowed us to achieve strong financial performance for the third year in a row and have laid a firm foundation for the future. As we look to the future of ag products, I'm confident that we will see further sales and earning growth driven by can aggressive effort to acquire complementary chemistries and/or related technologies for our key market segments and further cost reduction initiatives both in manufacturing and SG&amp;A areas. Finally, we are implementing programs aimed at shortening the innovation time cycle from the current 10-plus years. The concept is to work closely with our customers to create productivity enhancing technology for these customers or, as we refer to these efforts, customer driven innovation. While it is premature to go into more detail today, I'm confident that when I have the opportunity to talk with you next year, I'll be able to share some really exciting EBIT growth initiatives that APG has initiated and hopefully by then begun to realize. Thank you for your time. I look forward to taking your questions during the Q&amp;A session and would now like to turn the call over to Kim Foster, On the product front, we expect the targeted placement of MBI-601 biofumigant, Ennoble, with early adopter growers; significant growth in our seed treatment business with our partner, Albaugh; targeted placement with leading organic seed companies of our bio-stacked seed treatment with Groundwork BioAg; the launch of Amplitude biofungicide into large acre crops, including dry beans, a new market segment for MBI; the launch of the CG brand of Regalia, Venerate, Grandevo into the cannabis and home garden market, which we expect to represent a significant growth driver for us on a go-forward basis; growth in Zequanox sales as we continue to build our sales pipeline of potential industrial and power plant customers with our partner, Solenis]

Historically, eCollege has delivered unparalleled system stability and reliability as a means to drive student retention, satisfaction and program growth. However, as online education continues to grow and mature, institutions are looking to further differentiate their programs. Our on-demand model and .NExT architecture will provide our partners with the best of both worlds. Significant new customer benefits will include extensive customization features to create a unique look and feel for each program we serve, extensive feature flexibility so that different customers can offer unique sets of features to their faculty and students, greater interoperability with third-party and home-grown software through standards-based APIs, enhanced analytics through a new on-demand reporting system, and full internationalization of the platform to fuel international expansion initiatives. As growth in online distance education continues, we believe that the expanded customization openness and flexibility our clients will realize from this initiative, combined with our unique on-demand software as a service model, will continue to distance us from our competitors in the full distance online market. This project is going very well. The first major release remains on track for beta next fall, Now, let's talk small business. We continue to generate strong new user growth in our online ecosystem. Over 80% of QuickBooks online customers were new to the Intuit franchise once again this quarter. Total QuickBooks paying customer growth was also healthy in the quarter, as our desktop business posted strong results as well, In the professional tax business, we're seeing strong new customer growth early in the season, and our shift to the cloud continues to pick up steam. We intend to build on our leadership position, and capitalize on this once in a generation shift to the cloud for accountants]
